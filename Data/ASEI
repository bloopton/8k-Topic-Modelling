SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): July 19, 2002 AMERICAN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, INC. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Massachusetts 1-6549 04-2240991 - --------------------- -------------------- ---------------------- (State or other (Commission File (IRS Employer jurisdiction Number) Identification or incorporation) No.) 829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, Massachusetts 01821 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (Address of principal executive offices, including zip code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code (978) 262-8700 NOT APPLICABLE -------------------------------- (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT. Effective July 18, 2002, American Science & Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed its independent certified public accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen"), and has engaged the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as its new independent auditors for the Company's fiscal year ending March 31, 2003, effective immediately. These actions followed the Company's decision to seek proposals from independent accountants to audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2003. The decision to dismiss Andersen and retain PWC was approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of management. The independent Directors, who constitute the Audit Committee, voted unanimously for the change. None of the audit reports of Andersen on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was any such audit report qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the two most recent fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, there were no disagreements between the Company and Andersen, as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports, and there were no reportable events as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. During the two most recent fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, the Company did not consult with PWC regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. Pursuant to Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, the Company has not received a letter from Andersen and cannot obtain such letter after reasonable compliance; accordingly, complying with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K is not required.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  May 28, 2003
 American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AMEX:ASE)
today reported its financial performance for the fourth quarter and audited results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003.  Results announced in this earnings release are consistent with expectations announced in April. For fiscal year 2003, revenues decreased 5% to $61,958,000 compared with revenues of $65,396,000 in fiscal year 2002.  American Science and Engineering (AS&E) incurred operating losses of $7,879,000 during fiscal year 2003 as compared with operating losses of $3,850,000 during the prior fiscal year.  Pretax losses were $5,495,000 for the year ended March 31, 2003 versus pretax losses of $4,512,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002. After recording an additional valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets of $2,456,000, the Company had an after-tax loss of $7,951,000 or $1.20 per share for the year ended March 31, 2003, as compared to a loss of $4,512,000 or $0.87 per share for the year ended March 31, 2002.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 revenues decreased 22% to $12,885,000 as compared to $16,542,000 for the same period last year.  Operating losses for the quarter were $3,741,000 versus operating losses of $349,000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2002. AS&E realized an after-tax loss of $5,287,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, which represents a $0.77 loss per diluted share.  This compares to an after-tax loss of $2,022,000 or $0.37 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.
 
Dr. Roger Heinisch, Interim President and CEO, commented, "Our fourth quarter and fiscal year revenues were down because of many factors, including the delay in passage of the 2003 Federal Budget until February of this year, a delay in MobileSearch awards, and
work stoppage on a significant cargo project in the Middle East during the Iraqi war. The operating losses reflect: (1) shortfalls in revenue; (2) the increase in cost of sales due to the increase in reserves for excess or obsolete inventories, as well as unabsorbed manufacturing capacity due to production declines, and; (3) continued investment in Research & Development, specifically the Z
Backscatter Van, Shaped Energy systems and Radioactive Threat Detection technology.
 
"Although the fourth quarter and fiscal year results were disappointing, the current quarter bookings are encouraging as federal funding has started to flow.  In the last thirty days, we have announced over $20 million in orders from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)," continued Dr. Heinisch. "Our business focus  to offer technology solutions to high-threat government and military facilities  continues to gain momentum  Recent orders from the DoD and a new order from the Department of Homeland Security for AS&E's Radioactive Threat Detection technology demonstrate the U.S. Government's commitment to addressing the risk of a terrorist attack involving radioactive materials.  The ability to detect potential radioactive threats, including weapons of mass destruction and dirty bombs' is crucial to port security. These new orders underscore the value that the DoD places on AS&E's proprietary Backscatter technology in combination with transmission, and now Radioactive Threat Detection for Force Protection and Homeland Defense initiatives."

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 EARNINGS
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  October 21, 2003 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AMEX: ASE) (AS&E) reported revenues of $18,179,000, operating profit of $582,000 and earnings per share of $0.06 for the second quarter (ended September 30, 2003) of fiscal year 2004. This represents a $1,244,000 increase in revenues and a $0.16 improvement in earnings per share as compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year.
 
The second quarter 2004 results reflect: (1) an increase in revenue due to increased cargo and High Energy Systems (HES) revenues; (2) increased margins due to planned cost reductions and improved service contract margins; and (3) decreased SG&A and research and development expenses.
 
Included in other income (expense) for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 is $192,000 in expense representing the change in the "mark to market" value during the period of the outstanding warrants issued in connection with the private placement of common stock.
 
Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO, commented, "This is our second consecutive profitable quarter. Cargo revenue was sustained with our ability to continue work on three Shaped Energy systems in the Middle East, as well as the shipment of two MobileSearch systems to U.S. Army Europe. Additionally, our HES Division and our Field Service operation were strong contributors. We are now working to maintain and increase profitability through aggressive cost management, increasing revenue and growing backlog. By assessing every facet of the organization, we aim to increase margins and maintain our high level of quality to continue to deliver world-class products and services to the marketplace."
 
Mr. Fabiano continued, "This quarter's increasing revenues underscore our continued success in the homeland security sector. The $11 million in orders received from the U.S. Military and the U.S. Government reflect their requirement for AS&E's proprietary technology to support their applications for homeland defense and national security. They choose AS&E because their mission is dependent on successful detection. The combination of Z Backscatter and transmission X-ray imaging, unique to AS&E, provides the most comprehensive threat detection capability."
 
As previously announced, Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO, and Ted Owens, Executive Vice President and CFO, will host a conference call on to discuss the results and respond to questions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  January 22, 2004 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AMEX: ASE) (AS&E) reported revenue of $16,266,000, a net loss of $422,000 and a loss per share of $0.06 for the third quarter (ended December 31, 2003) of fiscal year 2004.  This compares to reported revenue of $17,220,000, a net loss of $1,058,000 and a loss per share of $0.15 for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.
 
Included in other income (expense) for the quarters ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 was $52,000 and $592,000, respectively, of expense representing the change in the "mark to market" value during the period of the outstanding warrants issued in connection with the private placement of common stock in May 2002.
 
"We are disappointed with the quarterly results," commented Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO.  "We had a strong start to fiscal year 04, but we had two issues in the third quarter that negatively impacted our results.  The first issue, a shipping delay, has been resolved as the MobileSearch
truck has been received at its destination port and consequently, the revenue for the system will be recognized in the fourth quarter.   Additional cost overruns associated with one of our CargoSearch projects also had a negative impact on operating results.  However, these declines were offset in part by increases in field service revenue. In addition, bookings of the Z Backscatter Van continue with the sale of the eighth system to a U.S. Government Agency for counterterrorism applications.
 
"Our top priority is to become consistently profitable," Fabiano said. "Operationally, we have strengthened the management team with the addition of Ken Breur as Vice President of Operations. Ken has 25 years experience in manufacturing operations and engineering.  His team will focus on product cost reduction and improved operational performance. We have reorganized our Product Management department with the promotion of Paul Grazewski to Vice President of Product Management. Paul's team will focus on product improvements, new product development and cycle-time reduction. We continue to assess every level of the organization with the goal of increasing revenue, improving margins, and growing backlog."
 
As previously announced, Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO, and Ted Owens, Executive Vice President and CFO, will host a conference call on Thursday, January 22 at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the results and respond to questions. To participate in the call, please dial (800) 283-8310 at least 10 minutes prior to starting time. For international participants, dial (706) 634-0899.

Exhibit 99.1
        
BILLERICA, Mass.August 2, 2004
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&E) (AMEX: ASE) reported revenue of $16,812,000, operating income of $409,000, and a net loss per share of $0.07 for the first quarter (ended June 30, 2004) of fiscal year 2005. This represents a $576,000 decrease in revenues and a $0.09 per share decrease in earnings per share versus the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.
        Included in other income (expense) for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 is $920,000, or $0.12 per share, in expense representing the change in the "mark to market" value during the period of the outstanding warrants issued in connection with a fiscal year 2003 private placement of common stock. Earnings per share, before considering this item, was $0.05 per share.
        "We are pleased with our positive operating profit of $409,000 for the quarter, which exceeded our plan," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO. "The $920,000 warrant expense is directly attributable to the significant rise in our stock price in the first quarter. The operational results also reflect gross margin improvement and an increase in operating profits as a percentage of revenue versus the first quarter of fiscal 2004."
        Fabiano continued, "Bookings were strong and exceeded historical averages for this quarter. The breakthrough Z Backscatter Van (ZBV), a drive-by X-ray screening system that detects explosives, continues to generate revenue with 29 systems sold to date. Twelve of these systems were ordered in the first quarter. In June, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded AS&E with $5.2 million for eight systems, and a metropolitan police department ordered two ZBVs to protect a major U.S. city. Also in Q1, we received a landmark order for $5.8 million in spare parts. Our Aftermarket Service & Support group continues to be a strong contributor to AS&E's bottom line.
        "We continue to move AS&E in a positive direction. Going forward, we remain focused on profitability and the implementation of new strategies and business processes to satisfy the needs of our customers and increase value for our shareholders."
        As previously announced, Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO, and Ken Galaznik, Acting Chief Financial Officer, will host the conference call on

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. Receives $23.2 Million Order from U.S. Government for 24 Z Backscatter Van X-ray Systems
 
U.S. Government to Deploy Mobile ZBV Systems for Counterterrorism Applications
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  September 16, 2004  American Science and Engineering, Inc.  (AS&E) (AMEX: ASE), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today the receipt of an order from the U.S. Government for twenty-four Z Backscatter Van (ZBV) X-ray screening systems.  The $23.2Million order is the largest ZBV order to date.
With this order, fifty-seven Z Backscatter Vans have been sold.
 
The systems will be configured for operation in harsh environments, and will be equipped with AS&E's Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) technology to detect nuclear devices and dirty bombs hidden in vehicles or containers. The order also includes installation, operator training and a one-year comprehensive parts and labor warranty.
 
"I am pleased to announce this milestone order from the U.S. Government for twenty-four Z Backscatter Vans," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO.   "Everyone at AS&E is proud to earn such a large order from this long-standing and valued customer.  The Z Backscatter Van is an ideal tool for the U.S. Government's counterterrorism missions. Its varied operating modes provide maximum maneuverability and flexibility for multiple applications, including urban surveillance, checkpoint security and force protection.  The speed and mobility of the ZBV make it a highly effective tool to detect plastic explosives, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and radiological threats in vehicles or other targets, quickly and easily. The ZBV is gaining visibility and traction globally and the U.S Government's rigorous performance requirements underscore the quality, capability and effectivity of this unique product."
 
AS&E's Z Backscatter Van is a low-cost, highly maneuverable screening system built into a commercially available delivery van. The ZBV employs AS&E's patented Z Backscatter technology, which reveals contraband that transmission X-rays miss  such as explosives and plastic weapons  and provides photo-like imaging for rapid analysis. The ZBV is capable of immediate deployment in response to security threats, and features a high throughput capacity to facilitate rapid inspections. The system's unique "drive-by" capability allows one or two operators to conduct X-ray imaging of suspect vehicles and objects as the ZBV drives past. When equipped with AS&E's optional RTD technology, the ZBV is also capable of identifying low levels of radioactivity from both gamma rays and neutrons.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
BILLERICA, MA. October 14, 2004  American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI), leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today an order for multiple linear accelerator systems totaling $5.3 million for its High Energy Systems (HES) Division. This is the second order received under an existing Basic Purchase Agreement between American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&E) and Accuray Incorporated executed in November 2002.
 
The accelerators will be manufactured for Accuray and will be used in stereostatic radiosurgery. This procedure uses radiation to shrink or kill tumors, allowing physicians to avoid invasive surgery to treat non-operable tumors.
 
"This order is another milestone in our collaboration with Accuray," said Anthony Fabiano, AS&E President and CEO. "It is very exciting that technology developed by our HES Division is instrumental in pioneering the use of X-band linear accelerators in the radiation therapy field. Accuray incorporates AS&E's compact, lightweight X-band linear accelerator and mounts it on a robotic arm to provide the surgeon flexibility and precision in targeting the tumor. The linear accelerator's ultra-compact design makes it ideal for this and important applications in other markets, including non-destructive testing and the screening of dense cargo utilizing AS&E's Shaped Energy technology."
 
High Energy Systems Division, based in Mountain View, California, is a designer and manufacturer of low to high-power electron beam (E-Beam) and X-ray systems and their subcomponents. HES produces the smallest and most compact linear accelerator on the market today, which has become comparable in its performance to similar S-band systems.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. Receives $3.7 Million Order f
or Z Backscatter Van X-ray Systems
Middle East Client in Arabian Gulf to Deploy ZBV for Counterterrorism Applications
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today the receipt of a $3.7 million order from a Middle Eastern Country for Z Backscatter Van (ZBV) X-ray screening systems. The systems will be configured for operation in harsh environments and to operate in "Portal Mode," which allows operators to inspect passing vehicles from a stationary position. The order also includes installation, operator training and a one-year parts warranty.
BILLERICA, Mass.  January 3, 2005 
 
"With this substantial order from a Middle Eastern client, the ZBV continues to gain traction globally," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO. "The ZBV's covert capability makes this an ideal tool for our client's counterterrorism missions. Additionally, the client is very impressed with the system's compact size, versatility, affordability and imaging capability.  Its varied operating modes provide maximum maneuverability and flexibility for multiple applications, including urban surveillance, checkpoint security, and container and vehicle screening at ports and borders. AS&E is developing the market for this unique proprietary product, and we are very encouraged by our expanding market share and global customer base."
 
A breakthrough in X-ray detection technology, AS&E's Z Backscatter Van is a low-cost, highly mobile screening system built into a commercially available delivery van. The ZBV allows for immediate deployment in response to security threats, and its high throughput capability facilitates rapid inspections. The system's unique "drive-by" capability allows one or two operators to conduct X-ray imaging of suspect vehicles and objects while the ZBV drives past.
 
The ZBV employs AS&E's patented Z Backscatter technology, which reveals contraband that transmission X-rays miss  such as explosives and plastic weapons  and provides photo-like imaging for rapid analysis.

American Science and Engineering, Inc. Receives $9.4 Million Order from the U.S. Government for Eight Z Backscatter Vans
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today the receipt of an order for $9.4 million from the U.S Government for eight Z Backscatter Van (ZBV) X-ray screening systems.  The Z Backscatter Vans will be configured for remote and harsh environment operation, and to function in "Portal Mode," which allows operators to inspect passing vehicles from a stationary position. The order includes installation, operator training, and parts and warranty.
BILLERICA, Mass.  August 1, 2005 
 
"The ZBV has proven itself to be a critical tool in the U.S. Government's counterterrorism efforts," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO of AS&E.  "With its track record, the ZBV has been established as the mobile product of choice for detecting car and truck bombs. Customers are impressed by the ZBVs performance and effectiveness in the field, reporting that lives are being saved with its use. As demonstrated with our Service and Spare parts order last week, we continue to advance the reliability and functionality of the ZBV to support all in-country' service requirements for these escalating orders."
 
A breakthrough in X-ray detection technology, AS&E's Z Backscatter Van is a low-cost, highly mobile screening system built into a commercially available delivery van. The ZBV allows for immediate deployment in response to security threats, and its high throughput capability facilitates rapid inspections. The system's unique "drive-by" capability allows one or two operators to conduct X-ray imaging while the ZBV drives past suspect vehicles and objects.  For personnel safety in dangerous environments, a remote console is available for operating the system in stationary mode from a distance of up to 500 meters.

FILES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTS
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&E) (NASDAQ: ASEI) filed today its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.  The net income and net income per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 differs from that disclosed in its press release dated August 5, 2005 due to an increase in the Company's provision for income taxes in the quarter.  The Company increased its previously announced provision for income taxes by $989,000 to amend the Company's calculated effective tax rate for certain equity-related items.  This change impacted previously reported net income per share by $0.11 and increased the Company's effective tax rate for the quarter to 22%. The Company projects that its effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 23%. The Company's net income and net income per share for the quarter after reflecting this change is $6,997,000 and $0.78 per diluted share.

ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
On September 15, 2005, the Company's stockholders approved the American Science and Engineering, Inc. 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan").  The 2005 Plan is intended to (1) provide long-term incentives and rewards to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its affiliates who are in a position to contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Company and its affiliates, (2) assist the Company and its affiliates in attracting and retaining persons with the requisite experience and ability and (3) more closely align the interests of the participants in the 2005 Plan with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
The 2005 Plan allows for the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive and nonstatutory stock options, cash awards and stock appreciate rights to eligible participants, who include employees of the Company and its subsidiaries in the case of incentive stock options, and employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company or any of its affiliates in the case of other awards.  An aggregate of 750,000 shares of Company common stock are available for grant under the 2005 Plan.  Shares subject to awards of options or stock appreciation rights shall count against this limit as one share for every share subject to the award, but shares subject to all other types of awards under the 2005 Plan shall count against this limit as 1.5 shares for every share subject to the award. Equitable adjustments will be made to the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan in the event of stock dividends, recapitalization, stock split, and the like. No single participant may receive in any fiscal year awards for more than 250,000 shares of Company common stock, except that in the first year of employment awards for an additional 250,000 shares may be granted. Additional restrictions are applicable to certain types of awards.
 
The plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible persons shall receive an award and the terms and conditions of each award, including, if relevant, the exercise price, the form of payment of the exercise price, the number of shares, cash or other consideration subject to the award, the vesting schedule and the term. The Compensation Committee will also make all other determinations and interpretations under the 2005 Plan. Subject to certain limitations, the Compensation Committee may delegate to one or more of the Company's executive officers the power to make awards to participants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The foregoing description of the 2005 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2005 Plan which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
 
On September 15, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved the terms of a Long Term Incentive Compensation Program (the "LTIP Plan"). The intent of the LTIP Plan is to fairly compensate senior executives for results achieved by the Company over a multi-year period.
 
The LTIP Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock and stock options to members of the Company's senior executive team, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Awards will be granted with a maximum term of 5 years, and will vest only upon achievement of goals outlined in the Company's strategic plan. These goals will be based upon growth and profitability targets and business goals, to be determined with Board input, anticipated to be achieved within a three-year period.  If the goals are met in two years, the awards vest at that time; if the goals are not met before the end of the term, the awards will expire and not become vested.
On September 15, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Change of Control and Termination for Convenience program (the "CIC Program") for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Company's executive staff, including its Chief Financial Officer.  With respect to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Anthony R. Fabiano, pursuant to the terms of the CIC Program, (i) in the event of a change of control of the Company in connection with which Mr. Fabiano is terminated, Mr. Fabiano will be eligible to receive (A) a payment equal to three times his average base salary over the prior five years (or portion thereof during which he has been employed by the Company) plus his annual target bonus, (B) the payment or continuation of health benefits for three years and (C) the vesting of all options and restricted stock then held by Mr. Fabiano, and (ii) in the event Mr. Fabiano is terminated by the Company without cause, he will be eligible to receive (A) a payment equal to two times his average base salary over the prior three years and (B) the payment or continuation of health benefits for eighteen months. The foregoing payments shall be limited to the extent necessary to comply with Sections 280G and 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The change of control provisions of the program will expire as to Mr. Fabiano effective March 31, 2008, but shall be automatically renewed for one-year terms.  Under the CIC Program, Mr. Fabiano will be required to comply with certain non-competition restrictions for a period of time after his termination.
 
With respect to other members of the Company's executive staff, pursuant to the terms of the CIC Program, (i) in the event of a change of control of the Company in connection with which a designated executive is terminated, such executive will be eligible to receive (A) a payment equal to one times such executive's average base salary over the prior five years (or portion thereof during which he or she has been employed by the Company) plus his or her annual target bonus, (B) the payment or continuation of health benefits for eighteen months and (C) the vesting of all options and restricted stock then held by the executive and (ii) in the event a designated executive is terminated by the Company without cause, he or she will be eligible to receive (A) a payment equal to one times such executive's average base salary over the prior three years and (B) the payment or continuation of health benefits for one year.  The foregoing payments shall be limited to the extent necessary to comply with Sections 280G and 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The change of control provisions of the program will expire effective March 31, 2008, but shall be automatically renewed for one-year terms.  Under the CIC Program, a participating executive will be required to comply with certain non-competition restrictions for a period of time after such executive's termination.

.   Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options to a Participant.
 
(b)
      
Terms and Conditions
.   The Committee shall determine the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each Option and the exercise price therefor, which shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify in the Grant Agreement or thereafter; provided that (i) no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of tenyears from the Option's Grant Date, and (ii) no Option may be granted with a reload feature which provides for an automatic grant of additional or replacement options upon the exercise of an Option. A Participant may exercise an Option by following such procedures as the Committee or its designees may specify from time to time. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including conditions relating to Applicable Laws, as it considers necessary or advisable.
 
(c)
      
Payment
.   No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the exercise price therefor is received by the Company. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, such payment may be made in whole or in part in or pursuant to any of the following methods:  (i) cash, (ii) by actual delivery or attestation of ownership of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant, including vested Restricted Stock, (iii) by retaining shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Option, (iv) for consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted cashless exercise program acceptable to the Company, or (v) for such other lawful consideration as the Committee may determine.
 
(d) 
Exercise Period.  
When a Participant's status as a Service Provider terminates, the Participant's Option may be exercised within the period of time specified in the Grant Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the Participant's Termination Date. In the absence of a specific period of time set forth in the Grant Agreement, an Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the date the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, but in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the expiration of the term of such Option. If a Participant's status as a Service Provider terminates from death or Disability or the Participant dies within three (3) months after his Termination Date, then (unless provided otherwise in the Grant Agreement) the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the date the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, but in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the expiration of the term of such Option. In no event may the Committee provide in a Grant Agreement that the period of time for exercising an Option following a Participant's Termination Date shall exceed three (3) years.
 
(e) 
Incentive Stock Option Rules
.  
In addition to the limitations and conditions that apply generally to Options, the following provisions shall apply to any Incentive Stock Option. The Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options only to persons who are employees of the Company or a Subsidiary as of the Grant Date. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Grant Date) of all shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under the Plan or any other incentive stock option plan of the Company or any Subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of shares on the Grant Date with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the Options for the first $100,000 worth of shares to become exercisable in that calendar year will be Incentive Stock Options, and the Options for the shares with a Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be Nonstatutory Stock Options. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any individual who, at the Grant Date, owns stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary unless the exercise price per share of such Option is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value per share at
the Grant Date and the Option expires no later than five (5) years after the Grant Date. If a Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option on or before the later of (i) the date two (2) years after the Grant Date, and (ii) the date one year after the exercise of the Incentive Stock Option, the Company may require the Participant to immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition.

Stock Appreciation Rights
 
(a)
      
Grant of SARs
.   Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant SARs to a Participant in tandem with an Option (at or after the award of the Option), or alone and unrelated to an Option. SARs granted in tandem with an Option shall terminate to the extent that the related Option is exercised, and the related Option shall terminate to the extent that the tandem SARs are exercised.
 
(b)
      
Terms and Conditions
.   The Committee shall determine the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each SAR and the exercise price therefore. A SAR granted in tandem with an Option shall have an exercise price not less than the exercise price of the related Option. A SAR granted alone and unrelated to an Option may not have an exercise price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on of the Grant Date. Each SAR shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify in the Grant Agreement or thereafter; provided that no SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the SAR's Grant Date. A Participant may exercise a SAR by following such procedures as the Committee or its designees may specify from time to time. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of SARs, including conditions relating to Applicable Laws, as it considers necessary or advisable.
 
(c)
      
Exercise Period.  
When a Participant's status as a Service Provider terminates, the Participant's SAR may be exercised within the period of time specified in the Grant Agreement to the extent that the SAR is vested on the Participant's Termination Date. In the absence of a specific period of time set forth in the Grant Agreement, a SAR shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the date the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, but in no event shall the SAR be exercisable after the expiration of the term of such SAR. If a Participant's status as a Service Provider terminates from death or Disability or the Participant dies within three (3) months after his Termination Date, then (unless provided otherwise in the Grant Agreement) the SAR shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the date the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, but in no event shall the SAR be exercisable after the expiration of the term of such SAR. In no event may the Committee provide in the Grant Agreement that the period of time for exercising a SAR following a Participant's Termination Date shall exceed three (3) years.

General Provisions Applicable to Awards
 
(a)
      
Transferability

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10(a), an Award (i) shall not be transferable other than as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and (ii) may be exercised during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. In the discretion of the Committee, any Award may be transferable upon such terms and conditions and to such extent as the Committee determines at or after grant, provided that Incentive Stock Options may be transferable only to the extent permitted by the Code.
 
(b)
      
Grant Agreement
.  
Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written or electronic grant agreement delivered to the Participant specifying the terms and conditions thereof and containing such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan or Applicable Laws as the Committee considers necessary or advisable to achieve the purposes of the Plan.
 
(c)
      
Committee Discretion
.  
Each type of Award may be made alone, in addition to or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each type of Award need not be identical, and the Committee need not treat Participants uniformly. In addition to the authority granted to the Committee in Section 10(l) to make Awards to Covered Employees which qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may grant Awards subject to such performance conditions (including performance-based vesting) as it shall determine in its discretion. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan or a particular Award, any determination with respect to an Award may be made by the Committee at the time of grant or at any time thereafter.
 
(d)
      
Dividends and Cash Awards
.  
In the discretion of the Committee, any Award under the Plan may provide the Participant with dividends or dividend equivalents payable currently or deferred, with or without interest. The Committee may also make cash payments under the Plan in lieu of or in addition to an Award. Such Cash Awards may be made subject to such terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Committee considers necessary or advisable.
(e)
      
Termination of Employment or Service
.  
Whether military service, government service, or other leave of absence shall constitute a termination of employment or service, and whether the vesting of an Award shall cease, be suspended, or continue during such leave of absence, shall be determined in each case by the Committee in its direction. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant's employment or service shall not be deemed to terminate upon the transfer of employment or service between the Company and an Affiliate. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant's employment or service shall be deemed to terminate, and further vesting of any Award shall cease, in the case of any sale, spin-off, or other disposition of the Participant's employer or substantially all of its assets. To the extent that this Section 10(e) or action by the Committee results in an Incentive Stock Option being exercised beyond the date that a Participant is deemed to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary for purposes of Section 424 of the Code, the Option shall be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
 
(f)
        
Change in Control
.  
In order to preserve a Participant's rights under an Award in the event of a change in control of the Company as defined by the Committee (a "Change in Control"), the Committee in its discretion may, at the time an Award is made or at any time thereafter, take one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the acceleration of any time period relating to the exercise or payment of the Award, (ii) provide for payment to the Participant of cash or other property with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount that would have been received upon the exercise or payment of the Award had the Award been exercised or paid upon the Change in Control, (iii) adjust the terms of the Award in a manner determined by the Committee to reflect the Change in Control, (iv) cause the Award to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by another entity, or (v) make such other provision as the Committee may consider equitable to Participants and in the best interests of the Company.
 
(g)
     
Loans
.  
The Committee may not authorize the making of loans to Participants in connection with the grant or exercise of any Award under the Plan.
 
(h)
     
Withholding Taxes
.  
A Participant shall pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under the Plan no later than the date of the event creating the tax liability. In the Committee's discretion, such tax obligations may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of delivery. The Company and its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant.
 
(i)
        
Foreign National Awards
.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, Foreign National Awards may be made to Participants on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as the Committee considers necessary or advisable to achieve the purposes of the Plan or to comply with Applicable Law.
 
(j)
        
Amendment of Award
.  
Except as provided in Section 10(k), the Committee may amend, modify, or terminate any outstanding Award, including substituting therefor another Award of the same or a different type, changing the date of exercise or realization and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option, provided that the Participant's consent to such action shall be required unless (i) the Committee determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Participant, or (ii) the action is permitted by the terms of the Plan.
 
(k)
    
No Repricing of Options.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the Company shall not engage in any repricing of Options or SARs granted under this Plan without further stockholder approval. For this purpose, the term "repricing" shall mean any of the following or other action that has the same effect:  (i) lowering the exercise price of an Option or a SAR after it is granted, (ii) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles, or (iii) canceling an Option or a SAR at a time when its exercise price exceeds the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another Option, SAR, Restricted Stock, or other equity of the Company, unless the
cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off, or similar corporate transaction (including any adjustment described in Section 5(c)).
 
(l)
        
Code Section 162(m) Provisions
.
   If the Committee determines at the time an Award is granted to a Participant that such Participant is, or may be as of the end of the tax year for which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, then the Committee may provide that the Participant's right to receive cash, shares, or other property pursuant to such Award shall be subject to the satisfaction of Performance Goals during a Performance Period. Prior to the payment of any Award subject to this Section 10(l), the Committee shall certify in writing that the Performance Goals and other material terms applicable to such Award were satisfied. Notwithstanding the attainment of Performance Goals by a Covered Employee, the Committee shall have the right to reduce (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant. The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Section 10(l) as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(m) 
Minimum Vesting Requirements for Full Value Awards.  
Each Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under the Plan (each, a "") shall vest in accordance with a schedule that does not permit such Full Value Award to vest in full prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date of the Award. This minimum vesting requirement shall not, however, preclude the Committee from exercising its discretion to (i) accelerate the vesting of any Full Value Award upon retirement, termination of employment by the Company, death or Disability, (ii) accelerate the vesting of any Full Value Award in accordance with Section 10(f), (iii) establish a shorter vesting schedule for any Full Value Award granted to a consultant, director, or newly-hired employee, (iv) establish a shorter vesting schedule for any Full Value Award that is granted in exchange for or in lieu of the right to receive the payment of an equivalent amount of salary, bonus, directors' fees, or other cash compensation, (v) establish a shorter performance-based vesting schedule in accordance with Section 10(c) or Section 10(l) (but in each case of not less than one year), or (vi) vest up to 1,000 shares per year for each Participant; provided, however, the total number of Full Value Awards granted under clauses (iii) and (vi) above shall not exceed 75,000 shares in the aggregate (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 5(c)).
Full Value Award
 
(n)
     
Limitation Following a Hardship Distribution.  
To the extent required to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(2)(iv)(B)(4), or any amendment or successor thereto, a Participant's "elective and employee contributions" (within the meaning of such Treasury Regulation) under the Plan shall be suspended for a period of twelve months following such Participant's receipt of a hardship distribution made in reliance on such Treasury Regulation from any plan containing a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code maintained by the Company or a related party within the provisions of Section 414 of the Code.

Item 4.01              Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") recently recommended, and the Board authorized, the Company's senior management to solicit proposals from various accounting firms to provide audit and related services for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005 and fiscal year end March 31, 2006.  The Company notified PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC") that it would be conducting a request for proposals for a possible change in independent registered public accountants and requested PwC to submit a proposal.  On November 3, 2005, PwC informed the Company that it would not be submitting a proposal in response to the Company's request.
 
Accordingly, on November 3, 2005, PwC resigned as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm upon completion of its procedures on the Company's unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the three and six-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and the Form 10-Q which such unaudited interim financial statements would be included.
 
The reports of PwC on the financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 contained no adverse or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
 
Except for the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in this paragraph, during the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, and through November 3, 2005, the Company did not have any reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company and PwC reported a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2005. That Annual Report stated the Company did not maintain effective controls over the review and monitoring of the accounting presentation on the sale of long-lived assets, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company has authorized PwC to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm regarding this material weakness and other matters.
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 
During the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 and through November 3, 2005, there have been no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the financial statements of the Company for such years.
 
The Company provided PwC with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested PwC to furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PwC agrees with the foregoing statements made by the Company and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of the letter, dated November 9, 2005, furnished by PwC is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this current report on Form 8-K.
 
 The Company has not engaged a successor independent registered public accounting firm at this time but expects to complete its review of proposals from other accounting firms and to select a new independent registered public accounting firm by mid-December, 2005.

American Science and Engineering, Inc. Receives Contract for the New OmniView
Gantry Cargo and Vehicle Inspection System
 
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  December 1, 2005  American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today the  receipt of a  $5.4 million  phased contract from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for its OmniView Gantry Inspection System. The first phase of the contract is valued at $1.9 million. The relocatable OmniView System, the industry's most comprehensive cargo and vehicle inspection system for detecting security threats and contraband, will be deployed by the DoD for force protection applications.
 
"We are proud to receive this order from the U.S. Military for the new OmniView Gantry System," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO.  "This unique system is designed to give our customers an affordable, highly effective alternative to the conventional high-energy cargo inspection systems currently on the market. This multi-view, multi-technology product is the only relocatable system available today that combines high penetration X-ray inspection with multi-view, photo-like backscatter X-ray imaging for unmatched detection capabilities. Security authorities can efficiently inspect even the most complex cargo, while maintaining the flow of commerce at facilities and checkpoint operations. We consider OmniView to be a superior product with excellent domestic and international potential for multiple market applications."
 
Unmatched Detection Capabilities: OmniView Gantry Inspection System
The OmniView Gantry System is the only multi-view relocatable system available today that combines 6 MeV high-energy transmission inspection plus three Z Backscatter X-ray views for left, right, and top-side imaging of cargo. The combination of technologies delivers the most reliable means of detecting contraband and threatening materials such as weapons and explosives hidden in cargo containers, tankers, and large vehicles. OmniView Gantry provides high penetration into inspected objects  up to 14 inches (350 mm) of steel  yet the system does not require an exterior building or heavy shielding. The OmniView Gantry System's scanning platform operates by moving on rails past stationary vehicles and cargo. The system is bi-directional allowing for a high throughput of approximately 2 trucks per scan, 24 trucks per hour.

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company" or "AS&E") hosted on May 19, 2006 its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 financial results conference call and filed in connection therewith a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as previously disclosed in a Form 8-K timely filed with the Commission. On May 23, 2006, Kenneth Galaznik, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, delivered a presentation to investors at a Homeland Security Technology Conference hosted by Morgan Keegan & Company. In connection with a related question and answer session, Mr. Galaznik addressed a potential misunderstanding of the recently reported fourth quarter results of the Company which had resulted in a belief that the Company had missed analysts' expectations. Mr. Galaznik noted that, according to most analysts and their underlying analyses issued following the earnings call, the Company had actually exceeded analysts' expectations for Q4 earnings. Mr. Galaznik explained that the $0.76 earnings per share consensus expectation of analysts excluded the accounting treatment effect of a charge for certain outstanding warrants, and stated that the comparable earnings per share number for Q4 (excluding the effect of such accounting treatment) was the reported $0.51 per share plus the $0.42 per share effect of the accounting treatment, or $0.93 per share. A copy of the investor presentation is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this item. The presentation, which includes high definition images, also can be accessed on the Company's website at www.as-e.com.

X-ray Imaging
 
Three things happen when you expose objects to X-rays
 - 
                 
Some X-rays the object
 - 
                 
go through
Some X-rays are in the object
 - 
                 
absorbed
Some X-rays are from the object, particularly from low atomic number materials
 - 
                 
scattered
 
Backscatter is an important complement to Transmission X-rays in dense cargo
 - 
                 
Transmission X-rays

Transmission X-rays detect by passing an X-ray beam through a target to a detector on the far side.
Backscatter X-rays
 
[GRAPHIC]
 
 
Backscatter X-rays detect by reflecting an X-ray beam from a target to a detector on the near side, creating a photo-like image that is easy to interpret and understand.

ITEM 7.01.  REGULATION FD.
On August 9, 2006, American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company" or "AS&E") released its first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006 financial results.  Following the release of its financial results, the Company held a conference call to discuss the earnings release and answer relevant questions.  In response to a question regarding ZBV order bookings asked during the call, Mr. Fabiano, AS&E's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated that "Although they have been delayed several weeks longer than we anticipated, we have recently been informed that we can expect two very significant government contracts as early as next week, but in all likelihood no later than the end of the current quarter.  Until such formal receipt of these orders, we cannot comment upon their specific nature or magnitude, but, as of today, we are comfortable reporting on these expectations with a high level of certainty, barring any unforeseen occurrence.  An audio transcript of the entire conference call is available on the Company's website.
The information in the preceding paragraph shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, unless the Company expressly so incorporates such information by reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today that it has been selected by U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) to develop and deliver a next-generation cargo inspection system designed to meet the requirements of the CAARS Program (Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System) to automatically detect shielded nuclear threats at the nation's points of entry. The total two-year development phase is valued at $28.8 million with a guaranteed minimum dollar value of $4.3 million. A substantial procurement could follow successful performance of the development phase, potentially increasing the total contract value up to $450 million. This opportunity represents one-third of the $1.35 billion estimated by the DNDO to be spent on the CAARS Program.
BILLERICA, Mass.  September 13, 2006  American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E
After a highly competitive procurement process, DNDO selected AS&E, who with its partner, Passport Systems, Inc., adopted an advanced system concept that combines high energy X-ray radiography with a unique 3-D X-ray interrogation technique. The EZ Radiograph system will combine 9 MeV transmission imaging radiography with automatic identification of high atomic number materials such as tungsten, lead, uranium, or plutonium. The system will be dual-use, in that it will meet both the needs of DNDO in detecting nuclear materials, as well as the traditional needs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in detecting contraband such as illegal drugs.
"This award by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a testament to AS&E's commitment to innovating the most advanced inspection solutions for our nation's security needs, today and in the future," said Anthony R. Fabiano, President and CEO of AS&E. "With AS&E's combined experience and expertise in X-ray technology, and our solid track record of delivering innovative technologies to market, we are well positioned to support the Government's global nuclear detection architecture. We are honored to work with our partners in the DNDO to help ensure the success of this most important program." Robert J. Ledoux, President and CEO of Passport Systems, stated that "We are pleased to be partnering with AS&E to address this important security problem and to achieve the objectives of the CAARS Program."

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today that it has been selected by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to deliver multiple cargo, parcel, and personnel X-ray inspection systems. After a highly competitive procurement process, NATO awarded the $13 million contract to AS&E to deploy the OmniView Gantry cargo and vehicle inspection system, the Z Portal multi-view cargo and vehicle screening system, multiple Geminiparcel inspection systems, and multiple SmartCheck personnel screening systems at a strategic security checkpoint.
BILLERICA, Mass.  November 28, 2006  American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E
"NATO's selection of AS&E X-ray systems is another example of our proprietary technology gaining adoption for mission critical scenarios," said Anthony R. Fabiano, President and CEO of AS&E. "NATO will utilize AS&E's full range of inspection products to integrate security and heighten detection capability at a strategic checkpoint. In combination, the OmniView Gantry, Z Portal, SmartCheck, and Gemini systems will be deployed for the highest screening capability for cargo, vehicles, personnel, and their baggage and parcels. Each system is uniquely designed to provide superior detection, while maximizing safety and high-throughput. We are confident that AS&E's X-ray inspection systems will provide the ultimate security solution for this very important client."
The OmniView Gantry System provides 6 MeV high-energy transmission inspection for high penetration into inspected objects plus ZBackscatter X-ray technology for imaging cargo. The combination of technologies delivers the most reliable means of detecting contraband and threatening materials, such as weapons and explosives hidden in cargo containers, tankers, and large vehicles.
OmniView Gantry: Unmatched Detection Capabilities
The recently introduced Z Portal is a multi-view, drive-through inspection system capable of scanning cars, vans, trucks, and their cargo for concealed threats and contraband. The Z Portal produces photo-like images, and highlights organic contraband, such as explosives, drugs, stowaways, and alcohol. With its compact design, the Z Portal system is ideal for high-traffic locations with space constraints and a high-throughput requirement. The Z Portal system is safe for drivers, operators, cargo, and the environment and can be configured with up to three Z Backscatter imaging modules to provide a left, right, and top-down view of the vehicles under examination. The relocatable screening system is available in two sizes  one for large trucks, buses, and cargo vehicles, and a smaller size for passenger vehicles.
Z Portal: High-throughput, Multi-View Detection Capability
AS&E's SmartCheck system is the industry's most comprehensive personnel X-ray screening system that clearly displays all types of threats and contraband concealed on a person, while ensuring their safety and privacy. The system displays both organic and inorganic materials revealing objects such as guns and knives, plastic and liquid explosives, composite weapons, and other hidden threats and contraband.  To eliminate privacy concerns, SmartCheck is equipped with unique software to protect the privacy of screened persons, while still effectively displaying threats.
SmartCheck: Assuring Privacy
 
Gemini is the first conventional parcel inspection system on the market to combine dual-energy transmission and proprietary Z Backscatter X-rays, allowing operators to obtain the most information about the contents of a parcel. Operators simultaneously view two images, a Z Backscatter image and a dual-energy image, dramatically increasing the likelihood of finding illegal materials hidden in parcels.

Fabiano continued, "We continue to invest in expanded marketing and sales activities to support worldwide channel expansion. These efforts are clearly producing positive results with 85% of bookings in the quarter coming from international clients. The $13 million NATO contract booked in the quarter is of particular significance as the order is for a combination of systems from all of our product areas  cargo, parcel, and Z

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2008 RESULTS AND
DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
BILLERICA, Mass.  November 5, 2007

The Company reported revenues of $37,627,000 as compared with revenues of $29,588,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, net income of $4,515,000 as compared with net income of $4,753,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and net income per share of $0.48 as compared with net income per share of $0.49 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. This represents a 27% increase in revenues and a $0.01 decrease in earnings per share versus the second quarter of the prior fiscal year due to lower gross margins attributable to product mix, new product development costs, and an 81% increase in research and development costs.
 
For the first six months of fiscal year 2008 ended September 30, 2007, the Company reported revenues of $82,098,000 as compared with revenues of $59,470,000 for the same period in the prior fiscal year, net income of $10,687,000 as compared with net income of $10,748,000 and net income per share of $1.13 as compared with net income per share of $0.90 for the six months ended September 30, 2006.  This represents a 38% increase in revenues, and a $0.23 increase in net income per share when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
 
In accordance with the previously announced dividend program, the Company is declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on December 05, 2007 to the holders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2007.
 
"AS&E ended the second quarter with solid bookings  increasing our backlog to a record level of $122 million," commented Anthony Fabiano, AS&E's President and CEO.  "Strong bookings from parcel, cargo, service and CRAD continued the trend to diversify both backlog and future revenue across all product lines. Additionally, we continued to make excellent strides with global customers, with international contracts representing 68% of total product bookings."
 
Fabiano continued, "We maintained SGA levels while increasing funding in targeted research and development areas to drive growth through the commercialization of new technologies.  Although product mix impacted gross margin for the quarter, it reflects a more diversified revenue stream and is in line with our fiscal year 2008 goal to drive revenue diversification through an expanded product portfolio. With our continued focus on strategic customers, the introduction of new products, coupled with the strengthening of our international channel, AS&E is well-positioned to penetrate new markets and take advantage of emerging security inspection opportunities around the world."

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
               
On February 7, 2008, the Board of Directors of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of an Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Fabiano. The Agreement contains provisions similar to those contained in Mr. Fabiano's November 3, 2005 Change in Control and Severance Benefit Agreement and other agreements previously executed by Mr. Fabiano, which agreements have been superseded by the Agreement
.
 
                Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will employ Mr. Fabiano for an initial three-year term, which commenced on February 7, 2008, and which will automatically renew for successive terms of one year each, unless either the Company or Mr. Fabiano provides written notice that the Agreement shall not be renewed at least three (3) months prior to the expiration of the term.  Mr. Fabiano will receive an annual base salary of $500,000.  Mr. Fabiano will also be eligible to participate in the Company's long-term incentive programs, in accordance with the terms thereof, on a basis at least as favorable as other senior executives of the Company.  Additionally, Mr. Fabiano will be eligible for an annual cash bonus with a target amount of 100% of his base salary and a maximum amount of 200% of his base salary.  The amount paid will be determined based upon objective performance metrics set by the Board of Directors.  In addition to participating in the Company's employee benefit plans, Mr. Fabiano will receive certain additional life insurance and long-term disability insurance benefits.
 
                The Agreement also provides Mr. Fabiano with severance benefits if his employment is terminated under certain circumstances.  Specifically, if Mr. Fabiano's employment terminates for any reason other than Cause or his resignation without Good Reason (each as defined in the Agreement), he is entitled to a pro rata bonus payment for the year in which termination occurs.  In addition, if Mr. Fabiano's employment terminates by reason of his death, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to two times the average of his last three years of base salary, and the Company will continue to pay the premium cost of medical and dental insurance for his eligible dependents for 18 months.  If Mr. Fabiano's employment terminates by reason of disability, the Company will continue to pay the premium cost of medical and dental insurance for 18 months and will continue to provide certain life insurance benefits for 18 months.  In the event the Company terminates Mr. Fabiano's employment without Cause or if Mr. Fabiano resigns from his employment for Good Reason, he is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary and target bonus, and the Company will continue to pay the premium cost of medical and dental insurance and will continue to provide certain life insurance benefits for 18 months.
 
                Mr. Fabiano is also entitled to receive change of control benefits if the Company terminates his employment without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason within two years following a change of control of the Company.  In that instance, Mr. Fabiano would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 2.9 times the sum of his base salary and target bonus, and the Company will continue to pay the premium cost of continued medical and dental insurance and will continue to provide certain life insurance benefits for 3 years. In addition, all of Mr. Fabiano's outstanding and unvested stock-based awards will accelerate.  In the event that any of Mr. Fabiano's stock-based awards are not assumed or replaced upon a change of control of the Company, all such awards that are unvested shall become vested and exercisable immediately prior to the change of control, regardless of whether or not Mr. Fabiano's employment has been terminated.  The change of control benefits may be reduced as necessary to minimize imposition of any tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
 
                All severance benefits other than those paid in the event of termination by reason of Mr. Fabiano's death are conditioned upon his signing a release of claims and complying with certain non-
 
 
 
disparagement obligations.  All severance benefits will be paid in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
 
                Mr. Fabiano is required to protect the secrecy of the Company's confidential information.  Further, the Agreement contains an assignment of rights to intellectual property provision, as well as non-competition and employee and customer non-solicitation obligations extending for the duration of employment and for one year after employment terminates, unless Mr. Fabiano's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason within two years following a change of control.

Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On April 16, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend of one purchase right (a "Right") for every outstanding share of the Company's common stock, $0.66 2/3 par value per share (the "Common Stock"). The Rights will be distributed on April 18, 2008 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 16, 2008 (the "Dividend Record Date"). The terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of April 17, 2008 (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co. (the "Rights Agent"). The Rights Agreement provides for the issuance of one Right for every share of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Dividend Record Date and for each share of Common Stock which is issued or sold between the Dividend Record Date and the "Distribution Date" (as defined below). The Rights Agreement was approved by the Board on April 16, 2008 to succeed the Company's previous rights agreement with the Rights Agent dated April 17, 1998. The prior agreement expired on April 16, 2008.
 
Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $250.00. The Rights will expire on April 16, 2018 (the "Expiration Date"), or the earlier redemption of the Rights, and are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.
 
No separate Rights certificates will be issued at the present time. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), (i) the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates, (ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after the Dividend Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of the Company's Common Stock will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any of the Company's Common Stock certificates will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate.
 
The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and Rights certificates will be issued on the Distribution Date. The Distribution Date will occur on the later of (a) the earlier of (i) the tenth business day following the later of the date of a public announcement that a person, including affiliates or associates of such person (an "Acquiring Person"), except as described below, has acquired or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the date on which a majority of the Board has actual knowledge that an Acquiring Person became such (the "Stock Acquisition Date") or (ii) the tenth business day following commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in any person or its affiliates and associates owning 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (the "Offer Commencement date") or (b) such specified or unspecified date thereafter which is on or after the dividend Record Date, as may be determined by a majority of the Board. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Rights Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Company's Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Rights Certificates alone will evidence the Rights. The Board of Directors may delay the distribution of the certificates.
 
If, at any time after April 16, 2008, any person or group of affiliated or associated persons (other than the Company and its affiliates) shall become an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right will have the right to receive shares of the Company's Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. Also, in the event that the Company were acquired in a merger or other business combination, or more than 25% of its assets or earning power were sold, each holder of a Right would have the right to exercise such Right and thereby receive common stock of the acquiring company with a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. Following the occurrence of any of the events described in this paragraph, any Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person shall immediately become null and void.
 
The Board may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after April 16, 2008 (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"). The Board, however, may not effect an exchange at any time after any person (other than (i) the Company, (ii) any subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
 
(iv) any entity holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all affiliates of such Person, becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding. Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights will be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by the holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
 
The exercise price of the Rights, and the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of the Common Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Common Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends paid out of the earnings or retained earnings of the Company and certain other distributions) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
At any time prior to the Expiration Date or the earlier redemption of the Rights, the Company, by a majority vote of the Board, may redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price"), as described in the Rights Agreement. Immediately upon the action of the Board electing to redeem the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
The Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board at any time prior to the Distribution Date without the approval of the holders of the Rights. From and after the Distribution Date, the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board without the approval of the holders of the Rights in order to cure any ambiguity, to change any time period for redemption or any other time period under the Rights Agreement or to make any other changes that do not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights (other than any Acquiring Person or its affiliates and associates, or their transferees).
 
The form of Rights Agreement dated as of April 17, 2008 between the Company and the Rights Agent, specifying the terms of the Rights (including as exhibits the form of Rights Certificate and the Summary of Rights) is attached hereto as an exhibit. The foregoing description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.

become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.

Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be:
 
(a)        a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, the State of New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or of any other State of the United States so long as such Person is authorized to do business as a banking institution in the State of New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), in good standing, having an office designated for such purpose in the State of New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is authorized under such laws to exercise stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, or

Failure to give any notice provided for in this , however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 21
 
.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by the Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price per share and the number or kind or class of shares of stock or other securities or property purchasable under the Rights Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by

Issuance of New Rights Certificates
the Board, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; provided, however, that (x) no such Rights evidenced by a Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such Rights would be issued, and (y) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.
 
.  The Board, by majority vote, may, at its option, at any time prior to the earlier of (a) the Distribution Date or (b) the Close of Business on the Expiration Date, redeem all (but not less than all) of the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the "").  Immediately upon the taking of such action ordering the redemption of all of the Rights, evidence of which shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights so redeemed will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of such Rights so redeemed shall be to receive the Redemption Price (without the payment of any interest thereon).  The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of Common Stock (based on the Current Market Price of the Common Stock at the time of redemption) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board.  Within 10 days after such action ordering the redemption of all of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than (a) the Company, (b) any Subsidiary of the Company, (c) any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any such Subsidiary or (d) any entity holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding.

right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.  The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.

Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of exchange shall state the method by which the exchange of the Common Stock for Rights shall be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.  Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of hereof) held by each holder of Rights.

Authorization of Additional Shares
Section 24
 
24.5.        .  The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock.

For the purposes of this , the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock shall be the Closing Price of a share of Common Stock (as determined pursuant to hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this .

(e)        to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,

The failure to give notice required by this or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the action taken by the Company or the vote upon any such action.  In case any Common Stock Event described in hereof shall occur, then, in any such case, the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to the Rights Agent and each holder of a Rights Certificate, in accordance with hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such Common Stock Event, which shall specify such event and the consequences of the event to holders of Rights under hereof.

(i) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. The multiple of cash and non-cash dividends declared on the Common Stock to which holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled, which shall be one thousand initially but which shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after April 
(A)
                             
17, 1998 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Dividend Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the amount of dividends which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be the Dividend Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Notwithstanding anything else contained in this paragraph (A), the Corporation shall, out of funds legally available for that purpose, declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in this paragraph (A) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(ii)
                                 
 
Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix in accordance with applicable law a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than such number of days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof as may be allowed by applicable law.

Voting Rights.
Section 3.
                                           
 
In addition to any other voting rights required by law or the Articles of Organization, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
 
Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one thousand votes on all matters submitted
(A)
                             
to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of votes which a holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to cast, which shall initially be one thousand but which may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, by law or by the Articles of Organization, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and the holders of shares of any other capital stock of this Corporation having general voting rights, shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(B)
                               
 
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, by the Articles of Organization or as set forth herein, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

Certain Restrictions.
Section 4.
                                           
 
Whenever dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(A)
                             
 
declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
(i)
                                   
 
declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(ii)
                                
 
except as permitted in subsection 4 (A) (iv) below, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on parity (either as to
(iii)
                             
 
dividends or upon liquidation dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
 
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(iv)
                            
 
(B)          The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under subsection (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
Section 5.               Reacquired Shares.
 
any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein and in the Articles of Organization.
 
Section 6.               Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
 
A)           Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (x) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, plus an amount equal to the greater of (1) $1,000 per share or (2) an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (y) to the holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (x) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B)           Neither the consolidation nor merging of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, nor the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
 
Section 7.               Consolidation, Merger, etc.
 
In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 8.               Redemption.
 
The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
 
Section 9.               Ranking.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Organization or a Certificate of Designation Establishing a Class of Stock relating to a subsequently-designated series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to any other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock subsequently issued, as to the payment of dividends and the
distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up and shall rank senior to the Common Stock.
 
Section 10.             Amendment.
 
The Articles of Organization and this Certificate of Designation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
 
Section 11.             Fractional Shares.
 
Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in whole shares or in any fraction of a share that is one one-thousandth of a share or any integral multiple of such fraction, which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Corporation may elect to make a cash payment as provided in the Rights Agreement for fractions of a share other than one one-thousandth of a share or any integral multiple thereof. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the issuance of fractions of a share of Series A Preferred Stock in multiples of one-thousandth of a share shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

AMERICAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, INC.
OnApril 16, 2008, American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "") declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (collectively, the "", and individually, a "") for each share of its common stock, $0.66 2/3 par value per share ("").  Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company after the Distribution Date (described below) one one-thousandth of a share of its Series A Preferred Stock, $0.00par value per share (the "").  The exercise price is $250.00 for each one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock.  The dividend is payable on April 18, 2008 to the record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on April 16, 2008.  One Right will also be issued for each share of Common Stock issued between April 16, 2008 and the Distribution Date.
Company
Rights
Right
Common Stock
Preferred Stock
 
.  The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.  The Distribution Date would occur, if ever and unless delayed by the Company's board of directors, ten (10) business days after either of the following events:
Exercisability of the Rights; Distribution Date
 
  A public announcement that a person or group other than certain exempt persons (an "") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (the ""), or
Acquiring Person
Stock Acquisition Date
 
  The commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group, other than certain exempt persons, owning 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock.
 
In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, then each holder of a Right would have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right, that number of shares of Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
.  If after the Stock Acquisition Date the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or 25% or more of its assets or earning power is sold, proper provision is to be made so that each holder of a Right would have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time has a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
Mergers and Asset Sales
 
Following the occurrence of any of the events described in this section, any Rights beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person would immediately become null and void.
 
  The Board may, at its option, at any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right.  The Board, however, may not effect an exchange at any time after any person (other than (a) the Company,
Exchange Option.
(b) any subsidiary of the Company, or (c) any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such subsidiary or any entity holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all affiliates of such person, becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding.  Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights will be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by the holder.
 
.  Until the Distribution Date, the Common Stock certificates will evidence the Rights, and the transfer of the Common Stock certificates will constitute a transfer of the Rights.  After the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights would be mailed to holders of record of the Company's Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate Rights certificates alone would evidence the Rights.
Transferability of Rights
 
.  The Board of Directors, by a majority vote, may redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time before the earlier of the Distribution Date or the close of business on the Expiration Date described below.  Immediately upon such redemption, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate, and the Rights holders will become entitled only to receive the redemption price.
Redemption
 
.  If not previously exercised or redeemed, the Rights will expire on April 16, 2018.
Expiration Date of Rights
 
.  The exercise price, the redemption price, the exchange ratio and the number of shares of the Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution under the following circumstances:
Anti-Dilution Adjustment
 
  in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred Stock, or
 
  upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of the Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price, or
 
  upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly cash dividends out of the earnings or retained earnings of the Company and dividends payable in shares of Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the exercise price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such price.  At the Company's option, cash (based on the market price on the last trading date prior to the date of the exercise) will be paid instead of issuing fractional shares of any securities (other than fractional shares of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one-thousandth of a share).
.  A Right holder, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive dividends.
No Shareholder Rights
 
.  Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement (described below) may be amended by the Board of Directors prior to the Distribution Date without the approval of any holders of the Rights.  After the Distribution Date, the Board of Directors may amend the Rights Agreement to cure any ambiguity, to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights (excluding the interests of any Acquiring Person) or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement.  A majority vote of the Board of Directors is required.
Amendments
 
.  Although the Company believes that neither the distribution of the Rights nor the subsequent separation of the Rights on the Distribution Date should be taxable to the stockholders or the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, realize taxable income upon the occurrence of an event described under "Mergers, Asset Sales and Self-Dealing Transactions."
Tax Consequences
 
.  The terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company andAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as Rights Agent.  A copy of the Rights Agreement is an Exhibit to Form 8-A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AMERICAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, INC.
ADOPTS NEW SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E),announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the adoption of a new shareholder rights plan on April 16, 2008. The plan is designed to enable the Company to protect shareholder interests in the event an unsolicited attempt is made for a takeover of the Company. The new plan replaces the shareholder rights plan entered into by the Company on April 17, 1998 which expired on April 16, 2008. The rights plan, similar to plans adopted by many other public companies, was not adopted in response to any current attempt to acquire the Company, and the Company is adopting the plan as a matter of prudent corporate governance.
BILLERICA, Mass.  April 17, 2008 
a leader in X-ray detection technology,
 
Each right will initially represent the right, under certain circumstances, to purchase 1/1,000 of a share of a Series A Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $250.00.
Under the plan, one right will be issued for each share of the Company's Common Stock outstanding on April 16, 2008.  Common Stock issued after that date will be issued with an attached right.
 
Anthony Fabiano, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The shareholder rights plan, similar to the plan previously maintained by the Company, is designed to ensure that our stockholders realize the full value of their investment in the Company.  The Company believes the plan enhances our Board of Directors' ability to protect the interests of our stockholders."
 
If a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, each right would entitle its holder to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.
 
The Board of Directors may redeem the rights at the redemption price of $0.01 per right, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to the earlier of April 16, 2018, the expiration date of the rights, or the date of distribution of the rights, as determined under the plan.
 
The rights will not affect the Company's reported earnings per share. Details of the shareholder rights plan are outlined in a letter which will be mailed as soon as practicable after April 18, 2008 to all shareholders of record on April 16, 2008.

AMERICAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, INC.
REPORTS REVENUE AND INCOME FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2008
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  May 13, 2008 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI)
(AS&E)
, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The Company reported revenues of $42,020,000 as compared with revenues of $45,919,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, net income of $2,789,000 as compared with net income of $5,790,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, and earnings per share of $0.30 as compared with earnings per share of $0.60 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. This represents an 8% decrease in revenues and a $0.30 decrease in earnings per share versus the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. This decline in earnings is primarily due to lower gross margins attributable to product mix and an 85% increase in research and development expense.
 
For fiscal year 2008, the Company reported revenues of $166,733,000 as compared with revenues of $153,186,000 for the prior fiscal year. The Company reported net income of $17,478,000 and earnings per share of $1.87 for the fiscal year 2008, as compared with net income of $24,610,000 and earnings per share of $2.38 for the prior fiscal year. This represents a 9% increase in revenues, and a $0.51 decrease in earnings per share when compared to the prior fiscal year. This decline in earnings is due primarily to lower gross margins attributable to product mix, a 71% increase in research and development expense, and a $0.12 per share charge related to the write-down of a note receivable and related interest the Company has deemed uncollectible.
 
"While we are not satisfied with the financial results for the year, we are encouraged that we achieved major strategic objectives to lay the ground work to improve results in fiscal year 09 and beyond," said Anthony Fabiano, AS&E's President and CEO. "Our expanded product mix
and increased global pipeline
has lead to more opportunities for our cargo and parcel business that will help to overcome some of the impact from funding uncertainties surrounding government procurements. Cargo and parcel revenues increased over 100% with a mix of both domestic and international sales. Service continues to be strong contributor to our top and bottom line with a 17% increase in revenue over last year.  While ZBV sales dropped overall for the year, we were able to add sixteen new ZBV international clients from the Middle East, Africa, APAC, Europe, and Latin America  contributing to the 43% increase in international sales as compared to the prior year."
 
Fabiano continued, "As we continue to drive revenue increases across product lines, we have identified improvements to processes that will have a direct impact on profitability in the current fiscal year. Additionally, Research and Development was a high priority in fiscal year 08, allowing us to accelerate new products and technologies to market to take advantage of emerging global security requirements. We are committed to improving results by driving down operating costs through increased efficiencies and by focusing on a handful of strategic priorities that will accelerate growth and profitability. As always we will continue to remain focused on customer satisfaction, long range vision and commitment to increasing shareholder value."
 
In accordance with the previously announced dividend program, the Company is declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on June 6, 2008 to the holders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2008.
 
At a recent meeting of the Board of Directors, the Stock Repurchase Program was once again approved, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to an additional $35 million of shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market.  Repurchases under this program will be made from the Company's existing cash balances and the shares will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  July 2, 2008  . (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today that the Company has received a $55.1 million contract from Abu Dhabi Customs. The Customs Administration at Abu Dhabi, the largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates, purchased multiple OmniView, Z Portal and Z Backscatter Van (ZBV) X-ray detection systems to scan cargo trucks, passenger vehicles, and containers at strategic border checkpoints.
American Science and Engineering, Inc
 
"We are very pleased to receive this significant opportunity to work with the government of Abu Dhabi and the Custom Directorate of its Finance Department," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO. "Abu Dhabi Customs will utilize AS&E's full range of cargo inspection products to protect the emirate's borders and citizens while facilitating trade and collecting revenues through effective customs operations as per the directorate strategic priorities. Each of AS&E's proprietary cargo inspection solutions are uniquely designed to provide superior detection, while optimizing high-throughput and safety."
 
Fabiano continued, "Our sales and marketing organization has made outstanding progress introducing our proprietary technologies globally and we are delighted to play such an important role in safeguarding Abu Dhabi's ports and borders from smuggling, trade fraud, and terrorist threats."
 
AS&E's Solutions for Abu Dhabi Customs: The Patented Z Backscatter
X-ray
The solutions purchased by Abu Dhabi Customs are each uniquely designed to provide superior detection, while maximizing safety and high-throughput. All leverage the Company's patented Z Backscatter X-ray technology  a proprietary, industry-leading capability that reveals the threats that competitive systems miss, including explosives, plastic weapons, and drugs.
 
Z Backscatter technology produces photo-like images of the contents of a container or vehicle, highlighting organic materials. Based on the X-ray Compton Scattering effect, Z Backscatter technology works by detecting and highlighting "low Z" materials (items that contain low atomic number elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen). Z Backscatter images display organic materials by directing a sweeping beam of X-rays at the object under examination, and then measuring and plotting the intensity of scattered X-rays as a function of the beam position.
 
AS&E's OmniView
Gantry Cargo & Vehicle Inspection System: High Penetration into Dense Cargo
The OmniView Gantry System provides 6 MeV high-energy transmission inspection for high penetration into complex cargo and dense objects  up to 14 inches (350 mm) of steel  yet the system does not require an exterior building or heavy shielding. The OmniView Gantry System's scanning platform operates by moving on rails past stationary vehicles and cargo. The system is bi-directional allowing for a high throughput of approximately 2 trucks per scan, 24 trucks per hour. Customers include NATO, U.S. Navy, and Port of Charleston as part of a U.S. Department of Justice-sponsored program.
 
 
:
AS&E's Z Portal
Cargo & Vehicle Inspection System
High-Throughput, Drive-Through Inspection
The Z Portal system is a multi-view, drive-through inspection system capable of scanning cars, vans, trucks, and their cargo for concealed threats and contraband. Z Portal produces photo-like images, and highlights organic contraband, such as explosives, drugs, stowaways, and alcohol. With its compact design, the Z Portal system is ideal for high-traffic locations with space constraints and a high-throughput requirement. The Z Portal system is safe for drivers, operators, cargo, and the environment and can be configured with up to three Z Backscatter imaging modules to provide a left, right, and top-down view of the vehicles under examination. The relocatable screening system is available in two sizes  one for large trucks, buses, and cargo vehicles, and a smaller size for passenger vehicles. Customers include U.S. Department of Defense and NATO.
 
AS&E's Z Backscatter Van
(ZBV
):
The Most Maneuverable, Versatile Mobile X-ray Detection System on the Market
A breakthrough in X-ray detection technology, AS&E's Z Backscatter Van is the Number One selling non-intrusive mobile inspection system on the market. ZBV is a low-cost, highly mobile screening system built into a commercially available delivery van. The ZBV allows for immediate deployment in response to security threats, and its high throughput capability facilitates rapid inspections. The system's unique "drive-by" capability allows one or two operators to conduct X-ray imaging while the ZBV drives past suspect vehicles and objects.  For personnel safety in dangerous environments, a remote console is available for operating the system in stationary mode from a distance of up to 500 meters.

And
DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI) (AS&E), today reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 ended June 30, 2008. The Company reported revenues of $39,494,000 as compared with revenues of $44,471,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, net income of $2,689,000 as compared with net income of $6,172,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, and earnings per share of $0.30 as compared with earnings per share of $0.66 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. This represents an 11% decrease in revenues and a $0.36 decrease in earnings per share versus the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. This decline in earnings is primarily due to lower sales volume, a 29% increase in research and development expenditures and a 19% increase in selling, general and administrative expenditures.
BILLERICA, Mass.  August 11, 2008 
 
The Company reported a record $100 million in bookings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 versus $43 million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Backlog for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 increased 53% to a record $160 million as compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.
 
"Although we are very pleased that we continue to break new ground with international contracts, we are disappointed that orders were not received in time to favorably impact the quarter's results," said Anthony Fabiano, AS&E's President and CEO. "With 88 percent of the first quarter product bookings for international regions  including the Middle East, Africa, Central and Latin America (CALA), Asia Pacific (APAC), and Europe  bookings and backlog were driven to record highs. Sales of cargo inspection products continued to grow with orders from two very strategic customers  Abu Dhabi Customs for our full range of cargo products and NATO for multiple Z Portal screening systems. And with 94% of ZBV bookings in the quarter for international customs and police agencies, our global install base is steadily increasing. The record $100 million in bookings is an affirmation of our strategy to grow and diversify our business through increased investment in new products and international sales. These results are consistent with our strategies to grow revenue and earnings in order to increase shareholder value over the long-term."
 
In accordance with the previously announced dividend program, the Company is declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on September 5, 2008 to the holders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2008.

DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
 
On September 10, 2009, at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") by a majority of votes properly cast to increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance under the 2005 Plan from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000 (the "Amendment").
 
It is anticipated that Company directors and officers will be accepting compensation under the 2005 Plan.
 
The following description of the 2005 Plan is only a summary of the material provisions and does not contain all of the terms and conditions thereof.  More information on the Amendment and the 2005 Plan's terms, including a discussion of awards to officers under the 2005 Plan, was provided in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2009 under the heading "Proposal 2  Increase in Authorized Shares under the 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan" and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Principal Features of the 2005 Plan
 
Purpose
 
The purpose of the 2005 Plan is to (1) provide long-term incentives and rewards to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its affiliates who are in a position to contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Company and its affiliates, (2) assist the Company and its affiliates in attracting and retaining persons with the requisite experience and ability and (3) more closely align the interests of the participants in the 2005 Plan with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
Administration
 
Awards under the 2005 Plan (other than awards to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, which are made by the independent members of the Board of Directors) are made by the Compensation Committee, which has been designated by the Company's Board of Directors to administer the 2005 Plan. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible persons shall receive an award and the terms and conditions of each award, including, if relevant, the exercise price, the form of payment of the exercise price, the number of shares, cash or other consideration subject to the award, the vesting schedule and the term. The Compensation Committee may also modify or amend awards and make all other determinations and interpretations under the 2005 Plan. Subject to certain limitations, the Compensation Committee may delegate to one or more of the Company's executive officers the power to make awards to participants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the power to make awards to participants, provided that the Compensation Committee will fix the maximum amount of such awards for all participants and a maximum for any one participant, and such other features of the awards as required by law.
 
Eligibility
 
While incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company or a subsidiary (including officers and directors who are also employees), all other awards may be granted to employees, officers, directors, and consultants of the Company or any affiliate.
 
Shares Issuable under the 2005 Plan, Share Counting and Individual Limitations
 
An aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock were available for grants of awards under the 2005 Plan. As of June 30, 2009, 165,989 shares remain available for issuance pursuant to the 2005 Plan. The amendment to the 2005 Plan increases the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under the 2005 Plan to 1,250,000. Shares subject to awards of options or stock appreciation rights count against this limit as one share for every share subject to the award, but shares subject to all other types of awards under the 2005 Plan count against this limit as 1.5 shares for every share subject to the award. Shares subject to awards that are canceled, terminated, expired, forfeited, lapsed, or settled in cash, shall again be available for issuance under the 2005 Plan. Shares tendered as payment of exercise or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations or repurchased by the Company using proceeds from options shall not be available for future issuance. Equitable adjustments will be made to the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan in the event of stock dividends, recapitalization, stock split, and the like.
 
All of the shares available under the 2005 Plan will be available for issuance upon exercise of incentive stock option awards. No single participant may receive in any fiscal year awards for more than 250,000 shares of Common Stock, except that in the first year of employment awards for an additional 250,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted. As to awards settled in cash intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation", no more than $2,500,000 per year may be paid to any single participant.
 
Description of Available Awards
 
The 2005 Plan provides for the following basic types of awards:
 
Stock Options.
  The Compensation Committee may grant options to purchase shares of Common Stock that are either incentive stock options (ISOs) or nonstatutory stock options (NSOs). No option may have an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The Compensation Committee may establish exercise periods in the option agreement, provided that no options may be exercised after the expiration of ten years from the grant date. If no specific periods are specified, an option shall remain exercisable for three months following the date the participant ceases to be a service provider, but in no event after the expiration of the term of the option. In the event of a termination due to death or disability, or if the participant dies within three months following termination, then, in the absence of specified periods in the option agreement, the option will be exercisable for twelve months from the date the participant ceases to be a service provider, but in no event after the expiration of the term. The Compensation Committee may not provide exercise periods longer than three years following the termination of service.
 
Reload featureswhich provide for automatic grants of additional or replacement options upon exerciseare prohibited.
 
An option may be exercised by the payment of the option price in cash, by actual delivery or attestation of ownership of shares of Common Stock owned by the participant, by retaining shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of the option, for consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted cashless exercise program, or for such other lawful consideration as the Compensation Committee may determine.
 
Additional restrictions apply to the granting of ISOs. ISOs may only be granted to employees. The aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to ISO awards exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Ten percent holders of the Company's stock may not receive ISOs unless the exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant and the option expires no later than five years from grant.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights.
  The Compensation Committee may grant Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), where the participant receives cash or shares of Common Stock equal in value to the difference between the exercise price of the SAR and the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of exercise multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is being exercised. SARs may be granted in tandem with options (at or after award of the option) or alone and unrelated to an option. SARs in tandem with an option terminate to the extent that the related option is exercised, and the related option terminates to the extent that the tandem SAR is exercised. The exercise price of an SAR may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant or, in the case of a tandem SAR, the exercise price of the related option. The discussion above of exercise periods applicable to options is also applicable to SARs.
 
Restricted Stock.
  The Compensation Committee may grant shares of Common Stock that may be subject to certain terms, conditions and restrictions, such as the requirement to pay a purchase price for the shares and restrictions on transfer during a period of time specified by the Compensation Committee.
 
Restricted Stock Units.
  The Compensation Committee may grant the right to receive shares of Common Stock (or the equivalent value in cash or other property) in the future that may be subject to certain terms, conditions and restrictions, such as the requirement to pay a purchase price for the units and forfeiture provisions. These awards are to be made in the form of "units," each representing the equivalent of one share of Common Stock, although they may be settled in either cash or stock. Restricted stock unit awards represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company.
 
General Provisions Applicable to Awards
 
In setting the terms of each award, except as noted above, the Compensation Committee has full discretion to determine the number of shares or units subject to the award, the exercise price or other consideration, if any, to be paid by the participant, the term and exercise period of each option granted, the conditions under which and the time or times at which an option becomes exercisable or under which the option, shares or units may be forfeited to the Company, and the other terms and conditions of the award. The Compensation Committee may also grant awards subject to performance conditions, awards that come with dividends or dividend equivalents or cash awards that may be subject to certain terms, conditions and restrictions.
 
The 2005 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee may use the following list of business criteria upon which it may establish performance goals for deductible performance-based awards made to covered persons: (1) increases in the price of the Common Stock, (2) market share, (3) sales, (4) revenue, (5) return on equity, assets, or capital, (6) economic profit (economic value added), (7) total shareholder return, (8) costs, (9) expenses, (10) margins, (11) earnings (including EBITDA) or earnings per share, (12) cash flow (including adjusted operating cash flow), (13) customer satisfaction, (14) operating profit, (15) net income, (16) research and development, (17) product releases, (18) manufacturing, or (19) any combination of the foregoing, including without limitation goals based on any of such measures relative to appropriate peer groups or market indices. Performance goals may be particular to a participant or may be based, in whole or in part, on the performance of the division, department, line of business, subsidiary, or other business unit in which the participant works, or on the Company's performance generally. The Compensation Committee has the authority to reduce (but not to increase) the amount payable at any given level of performance to take into account factors that the Compensation Committee may deem relevant.
 
Awards granted under the 2005 Plan are not transferable other than as designated by will or the laws of descent and distribution and may exercised during the participant's lifetime only by the participant or their legal guardian or representative, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. Unless it would not adversely affect the participant or is otherwise permitted in the 2005 Plan, the Compensation Committee may not amend, modify or terminate any outstanding award without the consent of the participant.
 
Additional Restrictions
 
The Compensation Committee may not authorize the making of loans to participants in connection with the grant or exercise of awards. The Company may not reprice options or SARs without stockholder approval. The 2005 Plan requires a vesting period for all restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards of at least three years, except for awards granted in lieu of cash; awards that satisfy a performance-based vesting schedule; and except in the cases of death, disability, retirement, change in control, termination by the Company. The 2005 Plan allows for restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards to consultants, directors or newly-hired employees and awards to vest up to 1,000 shares per year to have a shorter vesting schedule, provided that these awards shall not exceed 75,000 shares in the aggregate.
 
Change in Control
 
Upon a change in control of the Company as defined by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee may (1) provide for acceleration of time periods for exercise or payment of an award, (2) provide for payment to the participant of cash or other property equal to the amount that would have been received upon exercise or payment of the award had the award been exercised or paid upon the change in control, (3) adjust the terms of the award to reflect the change in control, (4) cause the award to be assumed, or new rights substituted for such award, by another entity, or (5) make such other provision as the Compensation Committee deems equitable to participants and in the best interests of the Company. The terms and conditions of awards need not be the same for each participant.
 
Amendment and Term of the 2005 Plan
 
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the 2005 Plan subject to any stockholder approval that the Board determines to be necessary or advisable to comply with any tax or regulatory requirements. Stockholder approval is required, however, if the Board materially amends the 2005 Plan to materially increase the number of shares that may be issued under the 2005 Plan, materially increase benefits to participants, materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan, or expand the types of awards provided under the 2005 Plan. Subject to the special limitations on the repricing of stock options or SARs, the Compensation Committee has authority to amend outstanding awards, including changing the date of exercise and converting an ISO to a NSO, if the Compensation Committee determines that such action would not materially and adversely affect the participant or the action is specifically permitted by the 2005 Plan.
 
Unless terminated earlier by the Board or extended by subsequent approval of the Company's stockholders, the term of the 2005 Plan will expire on September 15, 2015.

Also in connection with the Fifth Modification, the Intellectual Property Security Agreement dated as of August 11, 2003 between the Company and the Bank, which granted the Bank a first priority security interest in all of the Company's registered and unregistered intellectual property collateral, was terminated.
 
Except as otherwise set forth in the Fifth Modification, all of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Agreement remain in full force and effect.
 
The foregoing description of the Fifth Modification does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fifth Modification, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
BILLERICA, Mass.  April 1, 2010
 American Science and Engineering, Inc.
(AS&E
) (NASDAQ: ASEI), a leading worldwide supplier of innovative X-ray detection solutions, announced today the receipt of a $11.8 million order from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for multiple MobileSearch HE (High-Energy) cargo and vehicle inspection systems equipped with both high-energy transmission and Z Backscatter X-ray imaging for comprehensive threat and contraband detection including weapons, explosives, drugs, and currency.
 
In January 2010, the Company announced a deobligation of funds for a $9.1 million order from the U.S. government for MobileSearch
 HE systems.  However, the U.S. government issued a reevaluation notice of the proposals, and with this order increased AS&E's award to $11.8 million to support counter-drug and anti-terrorism programs.
 
"We are very pleased to learn that CBP has increased their contract award to AS&E to support their critical programs," said Anthony Fabiano, AS&E's President and CEO. "AS&E's MobileSearch HE offers flexible and rapid response at seaports, border crossings, and other high threat checkpoints.  The system's combination of technologies offers the unique capability to simultaneously detect both metallic and organic threats in cargo  providing detailed information about the contents of the cargo."
 
This contract was funded by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment  enhancing border security by expanding U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) capabilities to scan commercial traffic for contraband through X-ray and other imaging technologies.
 
AS&E's MobileSearch HE Cargo and Vehicle Inspection System:
High-Energy Inspection Plus Z Backscatter Imaging in Highly Mobile Configuration
The MobileSearch HE system offers two complementary imaging technologies integrated in one system. Its 4.5 MeV high energy transmission X-ray generates high penetration and high resolution images for the inspection of densely loaded cargo.
The system also utilizes Z Backscatter X-ray imaging to assist in the identification of organics for improved detection of drugs, explosives, and other organic contraband. Z Backscatter technology offers the additional benefit of photo-like images for improved image analysis time, as well as a wide field of view with no tire cutoff unlike transmission X-rays  allowing for the effective scanning of passenger vehicles and tires.
 
For added flexibility, the system can operate in multiple scan modes which allow high throughput scanning of cargo and vehicles or screening of oversized or odd-shaped cargo. Z Backscatter only mode with the boom stowed allows the operational flexibility of the Z Backscatter Van  in either "drive-by" mode to scan stationary objects, or "portal" mode to scan vehicles as they drive past the system. The MobileSearch HE system also features a unique integrated cab design that enables the drivers and operators to be in the same spacious cabin for improved communications and comfort.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
BILLERICA, Mass.
 July 22, 2010  American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&E) (NASDAQ:ASEI), a leader in X-ray detection technology, announced today the receipt of a $23 million order for a government agency for a significant quantity of SmartCheck
 Personnel Screening Systems.  The system will be deployed in a rugged environment and will provide security officials with a fast, reliable and safe way to screen people for a wide variety of threats.
 
"This sizable order demonstrates the versatility and value of Z Backscatter technology for critical counterterrorism missions," said Anthony Fabiano, President and CEO. "Designed for personnel inspection at high-risk checkpoints, the SmartCheck system provides rapid detection of explosives threats and contraband hidden on a person's body.  With Z Backscatter technology, the SmartCheck system is designed to combat evolving security threats by imaging the widest range of contraband concealed on a person."
 
About SmartCheck
SmartCheck provides security officials with a safe, non-intrusive means to detect both organic and inorganic threats hidden on a person.  Z Backscatter technology gives the operator easy-to-interpret information about where threats are hidden, thus eliminating the need for intrusive and time-consuming pat-down searches.
 
Since the SmartCheck system uses Z Backscatter X-ray technology, it is safe for both operators and scanned individuals. A scanned person receives about the same amount of radiation as a person flying for two minutes at an altitude of 30,000 feet, or less than 10 microrem (0.1 microsieverts) per scan. SmartCheck meets the manufacturer's requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard N43.17, which is the standard that the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) references for these systems.

Item 4.01.   Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
On July 21, 2010, American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") was notified that effective July 20, 2010, McGladrey & Pullen, LLP ("McGladrey") had acquired certain assets of Caturano and Company, Inc. (formerly Caturano and Company, P.C.), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm ("Caturano"), and substantially all of the officers and employees of Caturano joined McGladrey.  The Company believes that by consummating this transaction, Caturano has indicated to the Company (as of the effective date of the transaction) that it declines to stand for re-appointment for the Fiscal 2011 audit.  The Company's audit committee has not met since the Caturano-McGladrey transaction consummated and has not yet taken action with respect to the eventual selection of a new independent registered public accounting firm.  Caturano continues to be engaged as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and will perform the review of the Company's quarterly report for the period ended June 30, 2010.  The Company will file another Form 8-K under Item 4.01 to report the engagement of a new independent registered public accounting firm, within four business days of when such event occurs.
 
The audit reports of Caturano on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.  During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 and through July 21, 2010, there were no disagreements between the Company and Caturano on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Caturano would have caused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the Company's financial statements for such years.
 
The Company has provided Caturano with a copy of the disclosures in this Form 8-K and has requested that Caturano furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the Company's statements in this Item 4.01.  A copy of the letter from Caturano dated July 26, 2010 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Item 9.01.   Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Explanatory Note
 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company")
is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K to amend its Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 26, 2010, which reported that certain assets of the Company's registered public accounting firm, Caturano and Company, Inc. (formerly Caturano and Company, P.C.) ("Caturano"), had been acquired by McGladrey & Pullen, LLP ("McGladrey").  On August 5, 2010, the Company's audit committee approved a change in the Company's independent registered accounting firm, specifically, acceptance of the resignation of Caturano and selection of McGladrey as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm.  This amendment updates the information previously provided regarding the Company's registered public accounting firm, as set forth below.
 
Item 4.01.   Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
On July 21, 2010,
the Company
was notified that effective July 20, 2010, McGladrey had acquired certain assets of
Caturano, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
.  As a result, on and effective August 5, 2010, Caturano resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and McGladrey was appointed by the Company as its new independent registered public accounting firm.  The decision to change accountants was approved by the audit committee of the board of directors.
 
The audit reports of Caturano on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.  During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 and through August 5, 2010, there were no disagreements between the Company and Caturano on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Caturano would have caused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the Company's financial statements for such years.
 
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 and through August 5, 2010, the Company did not consult with McGladrey regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that may be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and McGladrey did not provide either a written report or oral advice to the Company that McGladrey concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Company has provided Caturano with a copy of the disclosures set forth herein and has requested that Caturano furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the Company's statements herein.  A copy of the letter from Caturano dated August 5, 2010, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 hereto
.
 
Item 9.01.   Financial Statements and Exhibits.

This letter sets forth the response of American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("the Company"), to the comments of the Staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (the "Staff") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), as set forth in the Staff's letter of July 27, 2010, regarding the Company's Form 8-K filed July 26, 2010 (the "Form 8-K").
 
For reference purposes, the text of each of the Staff's numbered comments has been provided herein in italics.  The Company's responses follow each of the comments.
 
Form 8-K Filed July 26, 2010
 
1.
            
We note that you are reporting that your independent registered public accounting firm, Caturano and Company Inc ("Caturano"), informed you on July 21, 2010 of its acquisition by McGladrey & Pullen LLP ("McGladrey").  Please amend your report to comply with our comments about the clarification of your disclosures.
 
Response:
            
The Company acknowledges the Staff's comment.  On or about the date hereof, the Company is filing an amendment to the Form 8-K.
 
2.
            
We see that you have inferred that your relationship with Caturano has ceased.  We see in Exhibit 16 that this interpretation does not reflect any formal communication by Caturano.  Please determine the exact status of your relationship with Caturano, and clarify your disclosures to present a definitive statement as to whether your former auditors resigned, declined
 
to stand for re-election, or were dismissed, and the date your relationship ended.  Please see the requirement in Item 304(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K.
 
Response:
            
As noted above, the Company is filing an amendment to the Form 8-K to clarify the transition of the Company's registered public accounting firm from Caturano to McGladrey.  As set forth in the amended Form 8-K, as a result of the acquisition, on and effective August 5, 2010, Caturano resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and McGladrey was appointed by the Company as its new independent registered public accounting firm.
 
3.
            
We read your audit committee has not met on the selection of a new accountant.  Please revise your disclosures to indicate whether the decision to change auditors was recommended or approved by your board of directors.  Please see the requirement in Item 304(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-K.
 
Response:
            
As stated in the amended Form 8-K, on August 5, 2010, the Company's audit committee approved a change in the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  No action regarding this change was required or taken by the Company's full board of directors.  Please see the Company's amended Form 8-K, which describes the action of the audit committee in accordance with Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(iii).
 
4.
            
We read that Caturano continues to be engaged as your independent registered public accounting firm, and that they will perform the review of the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  Please clarify your disclosures to explain how Caturano continues to be engaged and to perform work if your relationship with Caturano has ceased.
 
Response:
            
As noted above, the Company's amended Form 8-K now describes the fact that on and effective August 5, 2010, Caturano resigned as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and McGladrey was appointed as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm.  From July 20, 2010 until August 5, 2010, Caturano continued to be engaged as the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm.  Please see the response to Comment 5 set forth below.
 
5.
            
We read that substantially all officers and employees of Caturano have joined the McGladrey firm.  Please clarify how Caturano is able to continue to perform work if the officers and employees now work for a different firm.
 
Response:
            
As the Staff notes, the Company was notified that effective July 20, 2010, McGladrey had acquired certain assets of Caturano, and substantially all of the officers and employees of Caturano had joined McGladrey.  The Company understands that these officers and employees are continuing to provide services as Caturano during a transition period ending October 31, 2010 pursuant to a transition services arrangement between McGladrey and Caturano.
 
6.
            
In order for Caturano to provide you with the letter required by Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, please give a copy of the amendment to them as soon as possible.  Please include in the amendment as Exhibit 16 the letter from Caturano addressing the revised disclosures.
 
Response:
            
The Company acknowledges the Staff's comment.  The Company has provided a copy of the amended Form 8-K to Caturano and is including Caturano's response as Exhibit 16.1 to the amended Form 8-K.
 
The Company acknowledges that it is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosures in its filings with the Commission.  The Company also acknowledges that Staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to Staff comments do not foreclose the Commission from taking any action with respect to the Company's filings and that the Company may not assert Staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the Commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the United States.

Item 1.01
          
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors of American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), approved a new form of Indemnification Agreement (the "Indemnification Agreement") and authorized the Company to enter into such form of Indemnification Agreement with each of its directors and executive officers (each, an "Indemnitee").  Once effective, the Indemnification Agreement will supersede and replace any existing contractual indemnification agreements between the Company and such directors and officers.
 
Under the terms of the Indemnification Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of conditions and compliance with procedures specified in the Indemnification Agreement, the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify the Indemnitee against liability and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding as to which the Indemnitee is made a party, or threatened to be made a party, by reason of the Indemnitee's status as a director and/or officer of the Company.
 
The Company will indemnify the Indemnitee if:
 
                 
the Indemnitee conducted himself or herself in good faith, he or she reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in the best interests of the Company or that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and in cases of criminal proceedings, the Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; or
 
                 
the Indemnitee engaged in conduct for which a director of the Company is not liable under a provision of the Company's Restated Articles or Organization, as amended, authorized by Section 2.02(b)(4) of Chapter 156D of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ("Section 2.02(b)(4)").
 
In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, if an Indemnitee is otherwise wholly successful in the defense of a proceeding (which includes termination of the claim, issue or matter by dismissal), the Company will indemnify the Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against all reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding.
 
Under the Indemnification Agreement, the Company is also required to advance any and all expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding, provided that the Indemnitee furnishes the Company with (i) a written affirmation of the Indemnitee's good faith belief that he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct and (ii) an unlimited undertaking to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.
 
The Company will not indemnify, or advance expenses to, the Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding initiated by the Indemnitee unless (i) the initiation thereof is approved by the Company's Board of Directors or (ii) the Indemnitee has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in such proceeding.
 
The foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Indemnification Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Indemnification
.
 
(a)
                                 
Subject to Paragraphs 4, 7 and 9, the Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law (as such may be amended from time to time), indemnify Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee is, was or is threatened to be made a party (or is otherwise involved) by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status.

the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee was, is or is threatened to be made a defendant or respondent in a Proceeding because of Indemnitee's Corporate Status as a director of the Corporation against Liability incurred in the Proceeding if (A) (1) Indemnitee conducted himself or herself in good faith, and (2) Indemnitee reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in the best interests of the Corporation or that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, or (B) Indemnitee engaged in conduct for which Indemnitee shall not be liable under a provision of the Articles of Organization authorized by Section 2.02(b)(4) of Chapter 156D of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ("Chapter 156D") or any successor provision to such Section; and
(ii)

(b)
                                
Indemnitee's conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in, and the beneficiaries of, the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement that Indemnitee's conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.
 
(c)
                                 
The termination of a Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, is not, of itself, determinative that Indemnitee did not meet the relevant standard of conduct described in this Paragraph 3.

(a)
                                 
the Corporation shall not indemnify, or advance Expenses to, Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by Indemnitee unless (i) the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors or (ii) the Indemnitee has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in such Proceeding; and
 
(b)
                                
the Corporation shall not be required to make an indemnification payment to Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, agreement or otherwise, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payment to Indemnitee and Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payment to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

Indemnification of Expenses of Successful Party
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to and not in limitation of the rights set forth in Paragraph 3, to the extent that Indemnitee has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any Proceeding to which Indemnitee was a party because of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, Indemnitee shall be indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by law (as such may be amended from time to time), against all reasonable Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. For purposes of this Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 13 and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
 
6.
                                      
Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, Indemnitee shall be indemnified
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.
 
7.
                                      
Notification and Defense of Claim
.
 
(a)
                                 
Indemnitee shall notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought by Indemnitee and provide the Corporation with a copy of any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to such Proceeding with which Indemnitee is served; provided, however, that Indemnitee's failure to so notify or provide copies to the Corporation will not excuse the Corporation from its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the Corporation. The Corporation will be entitled to participate in any such Proceeding at its own expense.  Indemnitee shall have the right to engage Indemnitee's own counsel in connection with such Proceeding.  Indemnitee's counsel shall cooperate reasonably with the Corporation's counsel to achieve an appropriate result without undue duplication of cost in the defense of claims against the Corporation and Indemnitee.
 
(b)
                                
The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Corporation's written consent.  The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent.  Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold, restrict or delay consent to any proposed settlement.  Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Corporation nor the Indemnitee will be deemed to have unreasonably withheld, restricted or delayed its consent if it, he or she (as applicable) provides such consent within 30 days of a request by the other party.
 
8.
                                      
Advancement of Expenses
.  The Corporation shall advance any and all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request for advancement of Expenses (including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee with respect to such Proceeding); provided, however, that the payment of such Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of (i) a written affirmation of Indemnitee's good faith belief that Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct described in Paragraph 3 or that the Proceeding involves conduct for which Liability has been eliminated for directors of the Corporation under a provision of the Articles of Organization as authorized by Section 2.02(b)(4) of Chapter 156D or any successor provision to such Section and (ii) an unlimited undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined (after all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed or waived) that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Agreement (such affirmation and undertaking to contain only such terms as are required by the applicable provisions of Chapter 156D).  The undertaking referred to in clause (ii) above shall be an unlimited, unsecured general obligation of Indemnitee, and shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee's financial ability to make repayment.  Any advances and undertakings to repay shall be interest-free.  A sample form of written request for advancement of Expenses is attached hereto as Attachment A.
9.
                                      
Procedures
.
 
(a)
                                 
In order to obtain indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  A sample form of written request for indemnification is attached hereto as Attachment B. Any such indemnification shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, subject to the provisions of Subparagraphs 9(b) and 9(d) below.
 
(b)
                                
With respect to requests for indemnification under Paragraph 3 (but for avoidance of doubt, not with respect to requests for advancement of Expenses pursuant to Paragraph 8), except as set forth in Paragraph 11, no indemnification shall be made under this Agreement unless it is determined that Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Paragraph 3.  Subject to Subparagraph 9(c), the determination of whether Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Paragraph 3, and any determination that Expenses that have been advanced pursuant to Paragraph 8 must be subsequently repaid to the Corporation, shall be made in each instance (i) if there are two or more Disinterested Directors, by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of all the Disinterested Directors, a majority of whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more Disinterested Directors appointed by such vote; (ii) by special legal counsel (A) selected in the manner prescribed in clause (i), or (B) if there are fewer than two Disinterested Directors, selected by the Board of Directors, in which selection directors who do not qualify as Disinterested Directors may participate, or (iii) by the shareholders of the Corporation (but shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who at the time does not qualify as a Disinterested Director may not be voted on the determination).  Such determination shall be made within the 60-day period referred to in Subparagraph 9(a) (unless extended by mutual agreement by the Corporation and Indemnitee).  For the purpose of the foregoing determination with respect to requests for indemnification under Paragraph 3 or repayment of advanced Expenses, Indemnitee shall be entitled to a presumption that he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Paragraph 3 and is entitled to indemnification.  The Corporation acknowledges that Indemnitee may settle a Proceeding in order to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty and that, therefore, any such settlement (with or without payment of money or other consideration) shall not in and of itself overcome the presumption set forth above.
 
(c)
                                 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if a request for indemnification pursuant to Paragraph 3 is made after a Change in Control, at the election of Indemnitee made in writing to the Corporation, the determination required to be made pursuant to Subparagraph 9(b) above as to whether Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct or is required to repay advanced Expenses shall be made by Independent Counsel.  The Independent Counsel shall be selected in the manner prescribed in clause (ii) of Subparagraph 9(b).  Within 10 days after written notice of selection shall have been given, Indemnitee may deliver to the Corporation, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Paragraph 2,
and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis for such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.  If a written objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for Independent Counsel, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected (or, if selected, an objection shall have been filed within the 10 day objection period specified above), either the Corporation or Indemnitee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by Indemnitee to the Corporation's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under this Subparagraph 9(c).  The Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to this Subparagraph 9(c), and the Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Subparagraph 9(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.
 
(d)
                                
Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any costs or expenses (including attorney's fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Corporation hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Corporation, its counsel and its insurers in any Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee is being indemnified by the Corporation, including without limitation providing the Corporation or its counsel or insurer with any factual information or documentation under the Indemnitee's ownership, control or knowledge requested by any of such parties.
 
(e)
                                 
Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or its affiliates, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Corporation or its affiliates in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or its affiliates or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or its affiliates by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Corporation or its affiliates.  The provisions of this Subparagraph 9(e) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
 
(f)
                                   
The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Corporation or its affiliates shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
10.
                                
Right to Seek Court-Ordered Indemnification and Advance of Expenses
. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall abrogate or limit the right of Indemnitee to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for indemnification or an advance of Expenses to the extent permitted by Section 8.54 of Chapter 156D or any successor Section thereto that increases the scope of permitted indemnification.  In such event, Indemnitee's reasonable Expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification or advance of Expenses, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be reimbursed to the Indemnitee or otherwise indemnified by the Corporation.
 
11.
                                
Remedies
.  The right to indemnification and advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the applicable period referred to in Paragraph 8 or 9. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee's option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator in Boston, Massachusetts pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial or arbitration on the merits. Unless otherwise required by law, the burden of proving that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Paragraph 9 that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct.  Indemnitee's reasonable Expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, in whole, or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
 
12.
                                
Procedures Valid
.  The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to Paragraph 11 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
 
13.
                                
Partial Indemnification
.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in a Proceeding, but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or maters in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee, to the maximum extent permitted by law, against all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.
 
14.
                                
Subrogation
.  In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to enforce such rights.
15.
                                
Term of Agreement
.  This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of (a) six years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation or, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, fiduciary, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise or (b) the final termination of all Proceedings pending on the date set forth in clause (a) in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Paragraph 10 or 11 relating thereto.
 
16.
                                
Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive
.  The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Articles of Organization or Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of shareholders or directors of the Corporation, Chapter 156D, any other law (common or statutory) or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to waive any such other rights.
 
17.
                                
Insurance
.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Corporation from purchasing and maintaining insurance, at its expense, to protect itself or Indemnitee against any expense, liability or loss incurred by it or him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of Indemnitee's status as such, whether or not Indemnitee would be indemnified against such expense, liability or loss under this Agreement. To the extent that the Corporation maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Corporation or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity that such person serves at the request of the Corporation, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies.  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Corporation has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Corporation shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Corporation shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
 
18.
                                
Access to Information
.  Indemnitee shall be entitled access to such information in the possession of the Corporation as may be reasonably necessary to enforce Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement.
 
19.
                                
No Special Rights
.  Nothing herein shall confer upon Indemnitee any right to continue to serve as an officer or director of the Corporation for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.
 
20.
                                
Savings Clause
.  If this Agreement or any portion of this Agreement shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee against Liabilities with respect to any Proceeding to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been
invalidated, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give effect, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to the intent of the invalidated provision.
 
21.
                                
Counterparts

Modification and Waiver
.  No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.

Item 5.02    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On April 28, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company"), approved revisions to the Company's employment agreement (the "Revised Employment Agreement") with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Fabiano, and to the Company's Change in Control & Severance Benefit Agreement (the "Revised CiC Agreement") covering Kenneth A. Breur, Joseph Callerame,
Robert Cline,
Kenneth J. Galaznik, Patricia A. Gray, Paul H. Grazewski, George  M.  Peterman, Robert G. Postle, Michael N. Tropeano, Michael Williams and certain other officers (each, and together with Mr. Fabiano, an "Executive"). The revised agreements contain terms substantially similar to those previously in place.  The principal amendments to the agreements are noted below.  The following descriptions of the Revised Employment Agreement and the Revised CiC Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the forms of Revised Employment Agreement and Revised CiC Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Both sets of agreements have been revised to contain the change in control definition that the Compensation Committee approved in 2010 for all new agreements, which is generally more restrictive than the definition in the prior versions of these agreements.  Because the revised definition requires an actual change in control rather than shareholder approval of a forthcoming merger or consolidation, both revised agreements provide that if the employment of an Executive is terminated without cause between shareholder approval of merger or consolidation and the actual closing of the transaction (and the closing or another with the same acquirer occurs within 12 months), his or her severance and benefits will increase to the previously disclosed change in control level beginning with and contingent on the actual closing.  Because the Company has moved to cash-based awards in some instances in which it used stock-based awards when the contract was last amended, both revised agreements provide for similar treatment of stock- and cash-based awards (other than cash-based awards used to satisfy the annual bonus requirement).  Both revised agreements continue to provide for a cutback in payments and benefits if doing so in connection with a change in control would leave an Executive in a better position net of parachute taxes, but now clarify the order in which such cutback would apply and the application of the cutback.  Both revised agreements also provide that any severance or post-employment compensation protection will survive a termination or non-extension of such agreement, unless the Executive agrees otherwise, and that the two-year post-change in control protection period cannot be cut short by termination or non-extension of such agreement, absent the Executive's consent or an employment termination or resignation that does not qualify him or her for severance and benefits.  Payment and release of claims timing have been made more explicit in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("Section 409A").
 
Additional changes to Mr. Fabiano's agreement primarily reflect previously disclosed changes in compensation or revisions in light of changed legal interpretations, particularly under Section 409A.  The term of Mr. Fabiano's contract, absent evergreen renewals, is extended to April 28, 2014, two years beyond its current expiration date.  As with the initial agreement, the Company will pay Mr. Fabiano's reasonable legal fees in connection with his counsel's review of the Revised Employment Agreement.
 
The term of the Revised CiC Agreement, absent evergreen renewals, is extended by less than two years to March 31, 2013.  The Revised CiC Agreement also clarifies which events relate solely to a change in control and which to any termination without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" as defined in the Revised CiC Agreement, with the effect of limiting certain definitions and benefits to occurrences after or in connection with a change in control.  The "good reason" definition has also been revised to provide time limits during which the Executive must give notice and must resign if the "good reason" is not cured by the Company.  Indemnification now applies to the extent that a covered Executive prevails on any material issue raised in an indemnifiable action.  The definition of "former client" has been modified to enhance enforceability of the nonsolicitation provisions.

Each fiscal year during the term hereof, the Executive shall be considered by the Board (or the Compensation Committee thereof) for a cash bonus with a target of 100% of Base Salary (the "Target Bonus Amount"), and a maximum of 200% of the Base Salary (the "Bonus").

(ii)         In addition, the Company shall provide the Executive's designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary has been designated by the Executive in writing, his estate, with a pro-rata Bonus award for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, calculated based on the Target Bonus Amount for the fiscal year in which termination occurs and the number of days in such year that the Executive was employed, to be paid in a single lump sum payment within ninety (90) days following the date of termination of employment but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which termination occurs (the "Pro Rata Bonus").
 
(iii)        Any outstanding option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, restricted stock unit or other equity-based award granted by the Company to the Executive pursuant to the Company's 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan, any successor plan or agreement or any other equity compensation plan or agreement previously adopted by the Board in which Executive participated (the "Stock-Based Awards") and any cash-based awards granted under the Company's 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan as such ("Cash-Based Awards" and, collectively with the Stock-Based Awards, "Plan Awards") shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements.
 
(iv)       If the Executive is enrolled in the Company's medical and dental plans on the date of termination of his employment, and if his estate elects to continue participation of his eligible dependents in those plans, then for eighteen (18) months following the date of termination of the Executive's employment, the Company will contribute 100% of the premium cost of the Executive's eligible dependents under those plans.
 
(v)        The Company shall have no further obligation to Executive hereunder for (A) compensation or (B) benefits pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise described in Section 4 hereof.
 
(b)        .
Disability
 
(i)          The Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder, upon written notice to the Executive, in the event that the Executive becomes unable, during his employment hereunder through any medically determinable illness, injury, accident or condition of either a physical or psychological nature that constitutes a "disability" within the meaning of the long-term disability policy then in effect at the Company, to perform substantially all of his
 
duties and responsibilities hereunder, notwithstanding the provision of any reasonable accommodation, for a period of 180 consecutive days (a "Disability"). In the event of such termination:
 
(A)     the Company shall, as applicable, pay or provide the Executive with the Final Compensation and the Pro Rata Bonus;
 
(B)      if the Executive is enrolled in the Company's medical and dental plans on the date of termination of his employment, and if he elects to continue his participation and that of his eligible dependents in those plans under the federal law known as "COBRA," then for eighteen (18) months following the date of termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) coverage through a new employer, the Company will contribute 100% of the premium cost of the Executive's coverage and that of his eligible dependents under those plans, provided the Executive and his dependents remain eligible for such coverage under applicable law and plan terms;
 
(C)      the Company will continue to maintain the life insurance coverage that was in effect for the Executive on the date of termination of his employment, and will continue to reimburse the Executive for the premium cost of obtaining supplemental term life insurance coverage, which premium cost shall not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) annually in accordance with Section 4(e) hereof, for the period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) life insurance coverage through a new employer, provided such continued coverage is permitted by applicable law and plan terms. In the event such continued coverage is not permitted by applicable law or plan terms, the Company shall, on the first business day of each month, in addition to the premium cost for supplemental term life insurance provided for above, pay the Executive monthly payments in an amount equal to the premium payments that the Company would have made had the Executive remained eligible for such continued coverage, for the period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) life insurance coverage through a new employer;
 
(D)     any outstanding Plan Awards shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements, except that for purposes of Plan Awards, termination by reason of Disability pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be treated in the same manner as termination by reason of the Executive's death pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof; and
 
(E)      The Company shall have no further obligation to Executive hereunder for (A) compensation or (B) benefits pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise described in Section 4 hereof.
(F)      Any obligation of the Company to provide the compensation and benefits described in this Section 5(b)(i) is conditioned on (y) the Executive's signing and return of a timely and effective release of claims in the form attached to this Agreement as (the "Employee Release") and delivering it to the Company and having it become irrevocable within sixty (60) calendar days of the date his employment terminates (or such shorter period as the Company specifies but not below thirty (30) days), and (z) the Executive refraining from making any oral or written statement to any person or entity which has the effect of damaging the reputation of, or otherwise working in any way to the detriment of the Company, any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, or management (the "Non-Disparagement Obligation"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Non-Disparagement Obligation shall not prevent the Executive from making any truthful statement to the extent (i) necessary with respect to any litigation, arbitration or mediation involving this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the enforcement of this Agreement or (ii) required by law or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) with jurisdiction over the Executive.
Exhibit A
 
(ii)       The Board may designate another employee to act in the Executive's place during any period of the Executive's Disability. Notwithstanding any such designation, the Executive shall continue to receive the Base Salary in accordance with Section 4(a) and benefits in accordance with Section 4(e), to the extent permitted by the then-current terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plans, until the Executive becomes eligible for disability income benefits under the Company's disability income plan or until the termination of his employment, whichever shall first occur.
 
(iii)      While receiving disability income payments under the Company's disability income plan, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive any Base Salary under Section 4(a) hereof, but shall continue to participate in Company Employee Benefit Plans in accordance with Section 4(e) and the terms of such plans, until the termination of his employment.
 
(iv)      If any question shall arise as to whether during any period the Executive is unable, through any illness, injury, accident or condition of either a physical or psychological nature, to perform substantially all of his duties and responsibilities hereunder, notwithstanding the provision of any reasonable accommodation, the Executive may, and at the request of the Company shall, submit to a medical examination by a physician selected by the Company to whom the Executive or his duly appointed guardian, if any, has no reasonable objection to determine whether the Executive is so disabled (within the meaning of subsection (b)(i)) and such determination shall for the purposes of this Agreement be conclusive of the issue. If such question shall arise and the Executive shall fail to submit to such medical examination, the Company's determination of the issue shall be binding on the Executive.
 
(c)         . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for Cause at any time upon written notice to the Executive setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such Cause. The following, as determined by the Board in its reasonable judgment, shall constitute Cause for termination:
By the Company for Cause
 
(i)          The Executive's breach of fiduciary duty;
(ii)         The Executive's failure to perform (other than by reason of Disability), or gross neglect in the performance of, his duties and responsibilities to the Company or any of its Affiliates, which failure or neglect, if susceptible of cure, remains uncured or continues or recurs after fifteen (15) business days' written notice from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such failure or neglect;
 
(iii)        material breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates, which breach, if susceptible to cure, remains uncured or continues or recurs after fifteen (15) business days' written notice from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach (for the avoidance of doubt, any breach of Section 7, 8 and 9 hereof is not susceptible to cure);
 
(iv)       fraud or embezzlement or other dishonesty with respect to the Company or any of its Affiliates; or
 
(v)        conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude under any applicable law.
 
Upon the giving of written notice of termination of the Executive's employment hereunder for Cause setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such Cause and following any applicable cure period, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Executive for (A) compensation or (B) benefits pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise described in Section 4 hereof, other than for Final Compensation. Any outstanding Plan Awards shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements.
 
(d)         . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder other than for Cause at any time upon written notice to the Executive. In the event of such termination, in addition to the Final Compensation, and provided that no benefits are payable to the Executive under a separate severance agreement as a result of such termination, the Company shall pay or provide, as applicable, the Executive with the following (together, the "Severance Payments and Benefits"):
By the Company Other than for Cause
 
(i)          the Pro Rata Bonus;
 
(ii)         an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (A) Base Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of termination of the Executive's employment (prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), plus (B) the Target Bonus Amount for the year in which termination occurs (the "Lump Sum Payment");
 
(iii)        if the Executive is enrolled in the Company's medical and dental plans on the date of termination of his employment, and if he elects to continue his participation and that of his eligible dependents in those plans under the federal law known as "COBRA," then for eighteen (18) months following the date of termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) coverage through a new employer, the Company will contribute 100% of the premium cost of his coverage and that of his eligible dependents under those plans, provided the Executive and his dependents remain eligible for such coverage under applicable law and plan terms; and
(iv)       the Company will continue to maintain the life insurance coverage that was in effect for the Executive on the date of termination of his employment, and will continue to reimburse the Executive for the premium cost of obtaining supplemental term life insurance coverage which premium cost shall not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) annually, all in accordance with Section 4(e) hereof, for the period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) life insurance coverage through a new employer, provided such continued coverage is permitted by applicable law and plan terms. In the event any such continued coverage is not permitted by applicable law or plan terms, the Company shall, on or prior to the first business day of each month, pay the Executive monthly payments in an amount equal to the premium payments that the Company would have made in respect of the Executive's current term life insurance coverage and the premium cost for supplemental term life insurance coverage, had the Executive remained eligible for such coverage, for the period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent life insurance coverage through a new employer.
 
Any outstanding Plan Awards shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements. Any obligation of the Company to provide the Severance Payments and Benefits is conditioned on (y) the Executive's signing and return of a timely and effective Employee Release and delivering it to the Company and having it become irrevocable within sixty (60) calendar days of the date his employment terminates (or such shorter period as the Company specifies but not below thirty (30) days), and (z) complying with the Non-Disparagement Obligation. The Pro Rata Bonus and the Lump Sum Payment to which the Executive is entitled hereunder shall be payable in a single lump sum within (60) days after the date the Executive's employment terminates, except as required by Section 5(i) below. The Employee Release required for separation benefits in accordance with Sections 5(b), 5(d), 5(e) or 5(g) creates legally binding obligations on the part of the Executive and the Company and its Affiliates therefore advise the Executive to seek the advice of an attorney before signing it.
 
(e)        . The Executive may terminate his employment hereunder for Good Reason, but must first provide written notice to the Company of the condition giving rise to the Good Reason no later than sixty (60) days following the date on which the Executive obtains knowledge of the occurrence of the condition and give the Company thirty (30) days to remedy the condition. The following conditions arising without the Executive's prior written consent shall constitute Good Reason for termination by the Executive:
By the Executive for Good Reason
 
(i)     any action by the Company (including, for this purpose, the Board or any committee thereof) which results in a diminution in Executive's position, titles, reporting relationship, authority, duties or responsibilities (other than pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) in connection with Disability); provided, however, that a sale or transfer of less than all or substantially all of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other reduction of less than all of its business or that of its subsidiaries, or the fact that the Company has become a subsidiary of another company or that the securities of the Company are no longer publicly traded, shall not be taken into account when determining whether a material diminution in Executive's authority, duties or responsibilities has occurred;
(ii)     a diminution in Executive's rate of annual Base Salary or bonus opportunity pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof;
 
(iii)     the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location that is more than twenty-five (25) miles distant from Executive's then-current base office or work location, unless the new location is closer to the Executive's residence at the time the requirement is imposed; or
 
(iv)     any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement.
 
In the event of termination in accordance with this Section 5(e), and provided that no benefits are payable to the Executive under a separate severance agreement as a result of such termination, then the Executive will be entitled to the same payments and benefits, and at the same time(s), he would have been entitled to receive had the Executive been terminated by the Company other than for Cause in accordance with Section 5(d) above; provided that the Executive signs and delivers to the Company a timely and effective Employee Release under the same rules as apply under Section 5(d) and complies with the Non-Disparagement Obligation.
 
(f)        . The Executive may terminate his employment hereunder at any time for other than Good Reason upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Company. In the event of termination of the Executive pursuant to this Section 5(f), the Board may elect to waive the period of notice, or any portion thereof, without additional compensation to the Executive. In such circumstances, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Executive for (A) compensation or (B) benefits pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise described in Section 4 hereof, other than for any Final Compensation due to him. Any outstanding Plan Awards shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements.
By the Executive Other than for Good Reason
 
(g)       .
Upon a Change of Control
 
(i)          If a Change of Control occurs and, within two years following such Change of Control, the Company terminates the Executive's employment other than for Cause, or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, then, in lieu of any payments to or on behalf of the Executive under Section 5(d) or 5(e) hereof, and provided that the Executive signs and delivers to the Company a timely and effective Employee Release under the same rules as apply under Section 5(d), and complies with the Non-Disparagement Obligation, then in addition to the Final Compensation, the Company shall provide the Executive with the following:
 
(A)     the Pro Rata Bonus;
 
(B)      an amount equal to 2.9 times the sum of (A) Base Salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination of the Executive's employment (prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), plus (B) the Target Bonus Amount for the year in which termination occurs (the "Change of Control Severance Payment");
 
(C)      if the Executive is enrolled in the Company's medical and dental plans on the date of termination of his employment, and if he elects to continue his participation and that of his eligible dependents in those plans under the federal law
 
known as "COBRA," then for thirty six (36) months following the date of termination of the Executive's employment or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) coverage through a new employer (the "Continuation Period"), the Company will contribute 100% of the premium cost of his coverage and that of his eligible dependents under those plans, provided the Executive and his dependents remain eligible under applicable law and plan terms. In the event that such continued coverage is not permitted under applicable law or plan terms, the Company shall, on or prior to the first business day of each month, pay the Executive monthly payments in an amount equal to the premium payments that the Company would have made had the Executive remained eligible for such coverage, for the remainder of the Continuation Period;
 
(D)     the Company will continue to maintain the life insurance coverage that was in effect for the Executive on the date of termination of his employment, and will continue to reimburse the Executive for the premium cost of obtaining supplemental term life insurance coverage which premium cost shall not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) annually, all in accordance with Section 4(e) hereof, for the Continuation Period or, if earlier, until the Executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent (as to the extent of coverage and the cost to the Executive) life insurance coverage through a new employer, provided such continued coverage is permitted by applicable law and plan terms. In the event any such continued coverage is not permitted by applicable law or plan terms, the Company shall, on or prior to the first business day of each month, pay the Executive monthly payments in an amount equal to the premium payments that the Company would have made in respect of the Executive's current term life insurance coverage, the premium cost for supplemental term life insurance coverage, had the Executive remained eligible for such coverage, for the remainder of the Continuation Period;
 
(E)      notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable plans and agreements, any and all outstanding and unvested Stock-Based Awards shall immediately become vested and fully exercisable on the date of termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, and any Cash-Based Awards that are not being used to provide the Bonus under Section 4(b) shall immediately become vested and payable, subject to any requirements under Section 409A. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all Plan Awards shall be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and agreements.
 
The Pro Rata Bonus and the Change of Control Severance Payment shall be payable in one lump sum on the date which is sixty (60) calendar days from the date the Executive's employment terminates.
 
(ii)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any plan or agreement, if a Stock-Based Award held by Executive is not assumed or replaced, or to be assumed or replaced, upon a Change of Control, each unvested Stock-Based Award held by the Executive, whether or not his employment has been terminated hereunder, shall become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to the Change of Control, and in the event the Executive holds a Stock-Based Award requiring exercise, the Company shall give the Executive adequate notice and opportunity to exercise the Stock-Based Award.
(iii)      "Change of Control" or "Change in Control of the Company" shall mean the occurrence hereafter of any of the following:
 
(A)      any Person, other than the Company or an Affiliate, becomes a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3, as amended, as promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), directly or indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, of securities representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities;
 
(B)      the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other Person, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;
 
(C)      the closing of a sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
 
(D)      individuals who constitute the Board of Directors on the date hereof ("Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, that any individual who becomes a member of the Board subsequent to the date hereof, whose election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors shall be treated as an Incumbent Director unless he or she assumed office as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors; or
 
(E)       a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
 
provided, in each case, that such event also constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).
 
(iv)       .  If the Company's stockholders approve a transaction described in Section 5(g)(iii)(B) and thereafter the Company terminates Executive's employment without Cause before the consummation of the transaction described in such section, Executive shall receive the severance and benefits specified in Section 5(d) (applicable without a Change of Control), subject to the terms and conditions of that subsection.  If the approved transaction or another acquisition by the same entity closes by the first anniversary of the stockholder approval, any incremental benefits under Section 5(g)(i) with respect to a termination after a Change of Control will be provided as though the date of termination had corresponded with the date of closing and will be subject to an additional release of claims.  To effectuate this treatment for equity compensation, the Company will, with respect to the incremental equity treatment in Section 5(g)(ii), vest but freeze the incremental options and restricted stock units such that Executive cannot exercise or dispose of the equity unless and until the transaction is consummated by the first anniversary following approval and providing further that any such incremental equity compensation will, if no closing occurs by the first anniversary, expire and be
Potential Change of Control
 
forfeited on the earliest of that first anniversary, its original term (for options and stock appreciation rights), or 90 days following the closing of the change of control.
 
(h)
                                
Limitation on Payments
. If any payments pursuant to the Agreement would be subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Payments"), then Executive shall receive either (i) the full Payments or (ii) such lesser amount of the Payments as would yield the greatest net amount to Executive on an after-tax basis (applying the then highest aggregate marginal tax rates and Section 4999).  If a reduction of the Payments is required pursuant to subpart (ii), then the Payments will be reduced in the following order: (i) any cash payments, (ii) any taxable benefits, (iii) any nontaxable benefits, and (iv) any vesting of equity awards in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicability of the excise tax, to the extent necessary to maximize the reduced Payment.  The Company may elect to contest at its expense any initial IRS determination with respect to the Executive.  The Executive shall cooperate reasonably with the Company in any effort by the Company to contest an IRS determination under this paragraph, including by the making of such filings and appeals as the Company may reasonably require, but nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Executive to bear any cost or expense of such a contest or in connection therewith to compromise any tax item (including without limitation any deduction or credit) other than the Section 4999 tax and related interest and penalties, if any, that are the subject of the contested IRS determination.  In the event of any underpayment or overpayment under this Agreement, as determined by the nationally recognized accounting firm, the amount of such underpayment or overpayment shall be promptly paid to the Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may be, with interest at 120% of the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.  All tax determinations under this Section 5(h) shall be made at the Company's expense by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company in its reasonable discretion.  Any good faith determinations of this accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive.
 
(i)
                                    
Timing of Payments and other 409A Issues
. All payments by the Company to the Executive under this Section 5 shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5, be made on or before the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the Executive's employment terminates hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this Agreement, if the Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of the Section 409A Rules (as defined below) at the time of the Executive's "separation from service" within the meaning of the Section 409A Rules, then any payment otherwise required to be made to the Executive under this Agreement on account of the Executive's separation from service, to the extent such payment (after taking in to account all exclusions applicable to such payment under the Section 409A Rules) is properly treated as deferred compensation subject to the Section 409A Rules, shall not be made until the first business day after (i) the expiration of six (6) months from the date of the Executive's separation from service or (ii) if earlier, the date of the Executive's death (the "Delayed Payment Date"). On the Delayed Payment Date, there shall be paid to the Executive or, if the Executive has died, to the Executive's estate, in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the payments delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence. For purposes of the foregoing, the "Section 409A Rules" shall mean Section 409A of the Code, the regulations issued thereunder, and all notices, rulings and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service interpreting the same. For the avoidance of doubt, the compensation, benefits and other payments described in this Agreement (collectively, the "Payments") are intended either to comply with the Section 409A Rules (to the extent they are subject to such Section) or to be exempt from the requirements of the Section 409A Rules (where an exemption is available), and shall be construed accordingly. The Executive acknowledges, however, that any payment pursuant to this
 
Agreement could be treated as deferred compensation under the Section 409A Rules, and accordingly could be subject to excise tax, interest and other payments pursuant to the Section 409A Rules (the "409A Tax Payments"). The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive shall be solely responsible for all 409A Tax Payments. The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify or reimburse the Executive for any 409A Tax Payments or otherwise be liable for any 409A Tax Payments that may be due.
 
(j)
                                    
Mitigation, Etc
. The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, in no event shall the amount of any payment hereunder be reduced by any compensation earned by, or any benefit provided to, the Executive as a result of employment by another employer.
 
(k)
                                 
Post-Agreement Employment
. In the event the Executive remains in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates following termination of the term of this Agreement, by the expiration of the term or otherwise, then such employment shall be at will.
 
6.
                                 
Effect of Termination
. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply to any termination, whether due to the expiration of the term hereof, pursuant to Section 5 or otherwise.
 
(a)
                                 
Payment by the Company of any severance pay and benefits that may be due the Executive in each case under the applicable termination provision of Section 5 shall constitute the entire obligation of the Company to the Executive for (A) compensation or (B) benefits pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise described in Section 4 hereof. The Executive shall promptly give the Company notice of all facts necessary for the Company to determine the amount and duration of its obligations in connection with any termination pursuant to Section 5(b), 5(d), 5(e) or 5(g) hereof.
 
(b)
                                
Except for any right of the Executive to continue medical and dental plan participation and life insurance participation in accordance with the applicable termination provision of Section 5 and applicable law, benefits shall terminate pursuant to the terms of the applicable benefit plans based on the date of termination of the Executive's employment without regard to any continuation of Base Salary or other payment to the Executive following such date of termination.
 
(c)
                                 
Provisions of this Agreement shall survive any termination if so provided herein or if necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of other surviving provisions, including without limitation Sections 5(h), 5(i), 5(j) and 5(k), the obligations of the Executive under Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof and the obligations of both parties under Sections 13 and 14. The obligation of the Company to make payments to or on behalf of the Executive under Section 5 hereof is expressly conditioned upon the Executive's continued full performance of obligations under Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof. The Executive recognizes that, except as expressly provided in Section 5(a), 5(b), 5(d) or 5(e) or 5(g), no compensation is earned after termination of employment.

Confidential Information
.
 
(a)
                                 
The Executive acknowledges that the Company and its Affiliates continually develop Confidential Information, that the Executive may develop Confidential Information for the Company or its Affiliates and that the Executive may learn of Confidential Information during the course of employment.

While the Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of one (1) year after his employment terminates (unless the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason within two (2) years following a Change of Control pursuant to Section 5(g) hereof) (together, the "Non-Competition Period"), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, investor, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, compete with the Company or any of its Affiliates within the United States or in any other geographic area in which the Company or any of its Affiliates is then doing business. Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, the Executive agrees not to engage in any manner in any activity that is directly or indirectly competitive with the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates as conducted or under active consideration by the Company at the time the Executive's employment is terminated hereunder or at any time during the two year period prior to the termination of the Executive's employment, and further agrees not to work or provide services, in any capacity, whether as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise, whether with or without compensation, to any Person who is engaged in any business that is competitive with the business as conducted or under active consideration by the Company or any of its Affiliates for which the Executive has provided services at the time of termination of the Executive's employment hereunder or at any time during the two year period prior to the termination of the Executive's employment. For the purposes of this Section 9, the business of the Company and its Affiliates shall include all Products and the Executive's undertaking shall encompass all items, products and services that may be used in substitution for Products. The foregoing, however, shall not prevent the Executive's passive ownership of two percent (2%) or less of the equity or other securities of any publicly traded company.
 
(b)

(c)
                                 
The Executive agrees that during the Non-Competition Period, the Executive will not, and will not assist any other Person to, (a) hire or solicit for hiring any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates or seek to persuade any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates to discontinue employment or (b) solicit or encourage any independent contractor providing services to the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate or diminish its relationship with them.

Enforcement of Covenants

The Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof. The Executive agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the goodwill, Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Company and its Affiliates; that each and every one of
 
those restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area; and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent him from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which the Executive is bound by these restraints. The Executive further agrees that he will never assert, or permit to be asserted on his behalf, in any forum, any position contrary to the foregoing. The Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach any of the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8 or 9 hereof, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of Section 7, 8 or 9 hereof shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Executive agrees that the Non-Competition Period shall be tolled, and shall not run, during any period of time in which he is in violation of the terms of Sections 7, 8 or 9 hereof, in order that the Company shall have the agreed upon temporal protection set forth in this Agreement. No breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other purported violation of law by the Company shall operate to excuse the Executive's obligation to fulfill the requirements of Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof.

In the event that an action is brought to enforce a provision of this Agreement (pursuant to this Section 14 or otherwise), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the legal fees he incurs in connection with such action to the extent that the Executive prevails on any material issue raised in such action, otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees, in connection with any such action.

Change in Control Severance Benefits.
 
(a)
          
Executive agrees that once any Person other than the Company, a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company, or an employee benefit plan of the Company or any such subsidiary begins a tender or exchange offer or a solicitation of proxies from the Company's security holders or takes other actions to effect a "Change in Control," as hereinafter defined, Executive will not voluntarily terminate his or her employment with
 
the Company (or its Affiliates) until such Person has abandoned or terminated such efforts to effect a Change in Control or until a Change in Control has occurred.  Except as provided in Section 5(b), in the event that Executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment prior to the Change in Control, he/she will not be entitled to any payments or benefits under this Agreement, other than those described in Section 4(b)(i), or any severance pay plan, if any, of the Company.
 
(b)
          
In the case of a Change in Control Qualifying Termination, then Executive shall receive the following payments and benefits, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 6:
 
(i)  The Company shall pay to Executive in a single cash lump sum, within ten (10) days following the Date of Termination (or such earlier date as required by law), the sum of (1) all salary and commissions earned by Executive as of the Date of Termination but not yet paid and (2) Executive's accrued but unpaid bonuses and accrued but unused vacation earned through the Date of Termination.In addition, the Company shall pay to Executive in cash within five (5) business days of the Date of Termination, reimbursement for any unpaid, valid business expenses that are approvable in accordance with Company policy and that have been submitted by the Date of Termination (and shall pay any valid business expenses timely submitted after such date in accordance with Company policy).
Accrued Salary. 
 
(ii)  The Company shall pay to Executive in a single lump sum an amount equal to two times the sum of Executive's annualized Base Salary plus the target Short Term Incentive amount.  Subject to any delay under Section 10, payment will be made in the first payroll after the Release Effective Date (as defined below).
Severance Pay. 
 
(iii)  The Company shall pay 100% of the premium for COBRA coverage for Executive, Executive's spouse and his qualifying dependents, for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Date of Termination, as such premiums become due.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if Executive becomes employed by another employer and is eligible for medical, dental or life insurance coverage that is substantially equivalent (as to extent of coverage and as to employee cost) to the coverage of the same type that he or she were entitled to receive under this subsection, the Employer's obligation to Executive and his or her dependents under this subsection shall cease with respect to that type of coverage.  In addition, in the event that the Company is unable to provide COBRA to Executive as provided herein, Company will pay to Executive an equivalent amount in reimbursement for medical insurance (of equivalent benefits and cost) premiums paid by Executive.
COBRA Premiums. 
 
(iv)  Awards.
Stock-Based and Cash-Based
 
(1)
          
To the extent not already vested and exercisable, each Affected Award shall become fully vested and exercisable upon the
 
occurrence of the Change in Control Qualifying Termination, subject to compliance, if necessary, with Section 409A (as defined below).  In the event Executive holds an Affected Award requiring exercise, the Company shall give Executive adequate notice and opportunity to exercise the Affected Award.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the equity plan under which an Affected Award was granted, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from accelerating the vesting and exercisability of any or all Affected Awards to an earlier period, and terminating unexercised awards as provided under the equity plan.
 
(2)
          
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4 to the contrary, if an Affected Award held by Executive is not assumed or replaced, or to be assumed or replaced, upon a Change in Control, each Affected Award held by such Executive, whether or not he or she has experienced a Qualifying Termination, shall become fully vested and, where applicable, exercisable, effective immediately prior to the Change in Control.

Severance Benefits
.
 
(a)
          
In the case of a Qualifying Termination that is not a Change in Control Qualifying Termination, Executive shall receive the following payments and benefits, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 6:
 
(i)  The Company shall pay to Executive in a single cash lump sum, within ten (10) days following the Date of Termination (or such earlier date as required by law), the sum of (i) all salary and commissions earned by Executive as of the Date of Termination but not yet paid and (ii) Executive's accrued but unpaid bonuses and accrued but unused vacation earned through the Date of Termination. In addition, the Company shall pay to Executive in cash within five (5) business days of the Date of Termination, reimbursement for any unpaid, valid business expenses that are approvable in accordance with Company policy and that have been submitted by the Date of Termination (and shall pay any valid business expenses timely submitted after such date in accordance with Company policy).

Severance Pay
 
(iii)
 
COBRA Premiums. 
The Company shall pay 100% of the premium for COBRA coverage for Executive, Executive's spouse and his or her qualifying dependents, for a period of one (1) year following the date of
 
employment termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if Executive becomes employed by another employer and is eligible for medical, dental or life insurance coverage that is substantially equivalent (as to extent of coverage and as to employee cost) to the coverage of the same type that he or she were entitled to receive under this subsection, the Employer's obligation to Executive and his or her dependents under this subsection shall cease with respect to that type of coverage.
 
(b)  Potential Change in Control.  If the Company's stockholders approve a transaction described in Section 3(f)(ii) and thereafter the Company terminates Executive's employment without Cause before the consummation of the transaction described in such section, Executive shall receive the severance and benefits specified in this Section 5 (applicable without a Change in Control), subject to the terms and conditions of this section.  If the approved transaction or another acquisition by the same entity closes by the first anniversary of the stockholder approval, any incremental severance and benefits under Section 4(b) with respect to a termination after a Change in Control will be provided as though the Date of Termination had corresponded with the date of closing and will be subject to an additional release of claims.  The incremental severance and benefits will neither extend the number of months nor increase the severance and benefits beyond the number and amount applicable if Executive's employment had been terminated without Cause on the day of closing of a Change in Control (e.g., this Section 5(b) will not provide for more than a total of 18 months of paid COBRA coverage).  To effectuate this treatment for equity compensation, the Company will, with respect to the incremental equity treatment in Section 4(b)(iv), vest but freeze the incremental options and restricted stock units such that Executive cannot exercise or dispose of the equity unless and until the transaction is consummated by the first anniversary following approval and providing further that any such incremental equity compensation will, if no closing occurs by the first anniversary, expire and be forfeited on the earliest of that first anniversary, its original term (for options and stock appreciation rights), or 90 days following the closing of the Change in Control.
 
6.
            
Limitation on Payments
.  If any payments pursuant to the Agreement would be subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the " Payments"), then Executive shall receive either (i) the full Payments or (ii) such lesser amount of the Payments as would yield the greatest net amount to Executive on an after-tax basis (applying the then highest aggregate marginal tax rates and Section 4999).  If a reduction of the Payments is required pursuant to subpart (ii), then the Payment will be reduced in the following order: (i) any vesting of equity awards where the equity awards will, after the Change in Control, not be for publicly-traded stock nor cashed out in the Change in Control, (ii) any taxable benefits, (iii) any cash payments (including any cash payments by reason of equity awards cashed out by reason of the Change in Control when and if those payments are counted for purposes of Section 4999), (iv) any nontaxable benefits, and (v) any vesting of equity awards that will either be cashed out in the Change in Control or be equity awards with respect to publicly traded stock, in each case in clauses (i) through (v) in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicability of the excise tax, to the extent necessary to maximize the reduced Payment.  The Company may elect to contest at its expense any initial IRS determination with respect to an Executive.  Executive shall cooperate reasonably with the Company in any effort by the Company to
 
contest an IRS determination under this paragraph, including by the making of such filings and appeals as the Company may reasonably require, but nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Executive to bear any cost or expense of such a contest or in connection therewith to compromise any tax item (including without limitation any deduction or credit) other than the Section 4999 tax and related interest and penalties, if any, that are the subject of the contested IRS determination.  In the event of any underpayment or overpayment under this Agreement, as determined by the nationally recognized accounting firm, the amount of such underpayment or overpayment shall be promptly paid to Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may be, with interest at 120% of the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
All tax determinations under this Section 6 shall be made at the Company's expense by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company in its reasonable discretion.  Any good faith determinations of this accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive.
 
7.
            
Noncompetition
.  During the Non-Competition Period, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, investor (nothing contained in this Agreement, however, shall prevent Executive from passive ownership of two percent (2%) or less of the voting stock of any publicly traded company (other than the Company)), consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, compete with the Company or any of its Affiliates within the United States or in any country in which the Company or any of its Affiliates is then doing business. Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, Executive agrees not to engage in any manner in any activity that is directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates as conducted or under consideration at any time during Executive's employment. Executive further agrees that while Executiveis employed by the Company and during the Non-Competition Period, Executive will not hire or attempt to hire any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, assist in such hiring by any Person, encourage any such employee to terminate his or her relationship with the Company or any of its Affiliates, or solicit or encourage any customer or vendor of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate or diminish its relationship with them, or, in the case of a customer, to conduct with any Person any business or activity which such customer conducts or could conduct with the Company or any of its Affiliates.
 
8.
            
Payment Obligations Absolute
.  Upon a Change in Control Qualifying Termination or a Qualifying Termination, the Company's obligations to pay the benefits described in Section 4 (or the benefits described in Section 5 for a Qualifying Termination) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company or any Affiliate may have against any Executive.  In no event shall Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to Executive under any of the provisions of the Agreement and, except as otherwise provided in Section 7, in no event shall the amount of any payment hereunder be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of employment by another employer.
 
9.
            
Amendment; Survival
.  This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by Executive and by a expressly authorized representative of the Company.  Absent Executive's written consent to the contrary, the provisions of Section 5 will
 
survive any termination or nonextension of this Agreement, and the Company may not terminate this Agreement within two years following a Change in Control or provide a notice of nonrenewal effective within such two years, other than a termination or notice of nonrenewal following a cessation of employment that is not a Change in Control Qualifying Termination.
 
10.
          
Withholding; Section 409A
.  All payments and benefits hereunder shall be subject to reduction for applicable tax withholdings.  If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to Executive in connection with his or her employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A") and Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination Executive hereby agrees that he or she is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6) month period measured from the date of Executive's "separation from service" (as determined under Section 409A) or (ii) the tenth (10
th
) day following the date of Executive's death following such separation from service (the "New Payment Date").  The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to Executive during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum in the first payroll period beginning after such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule.    This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith.  Terms defined in this Agreement will have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A.  In any event, the Company makes no representations or warranty and will have no liability to Executive or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
Executive acknowledges that the structure of this Agreement makes it likely under current law that payments of severance under Sections 4(b)(ii), 5(a)(ii),  and 5(b) above will be delayed by six (6) months.
 
11.
          
Indemnification
.  The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses (including without limitation fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Executive in connection with efforts to enforce his or her rights under this Agreement to the extent that the Executive prevails on any material issue raised in such action and will indemnify and hold harmless the Executive from and against any damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by Executive in connection with any litigation or threatened litigation, including any regulatory proceedings, arising out of the making, performance or enforcement of this Agreement.
 
12.
          
Source of Payment
.  Nothing herein shall be construed as establishing a trust or as requiring the Company to set aside funds to meet its obligations hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board in its discretion so determines, the Company may establish a so-called "rabbi trust" or similar arrangement to assist it in meeting any such obligations that it may have.
 
13.
          
Required Release
.  The Company's obligation to provide severance pay and other benefits under this Agreement, however, is subject (a) to Executive's signing a release of
 
claims in favor of the Company in the form to be provided by the Company that becomes enforceable within sixty (60) days (or such shorter period as the Company specifies) following the Date of Termination (the "Release"); and (b) to Executive's meeting in full his or her obligations under any other agreements in effect between Executive and the Company.  The "Release Effective Date" is the date the Release becomes enforceable, provided that if the sixty (60) day period for providing an enforceable Release extends into a calendar year subsequent to the year containing the Date of Termination, the Release Effective Date will be no earlier than the first business day of such subsequent year.  The Executive must also acknowledge his or her continuing responsibility to honor any non-compete and non-solicitation obligations previously undertaken by Executive for a period of one year from the Termination Date or such other period as the obligations specify.
 
14.
          
Nondisparagement
.  Executive agrees to not make any oral or written communication to any person or entity which has the effect of damaging the reputation of, or otherwise working in any way to the detriment of, the Company, its officers, directors or management other than as required by law or in performance of his or her duties to the Company (such as in a performance review).
 
15.
          
Notices
.  Any and all notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be effective when delivered in person or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified, and addressed to Executive at his last known address on the books of the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal place of business, attention of the President, or to such other address as either party may specify by notice to the other actually received.
 
16.
          
Entire Agreement
.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior communications, agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the terms and conditions of Executive's severance from employment with the Company and its Affiliates, including any prior Change in Control & Severance Benefit Agreement with the Company.
 
17.
          
Severability.
  Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable such that if any one provision or clause conflicts with existing or future applicable law, or may not be given full effect because of such law, this shall not affect any other provision of the Agreement which, consistent with such law, shall remain in full force and effect.  All surviving clauses shall be construed so as to effectuate the purpose and intent of the parties.
 
18.
          
Headings
.  The headings and captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and in no way define or describe the scope or content of any provision of this Agreement.
 
19.
          
Counterparts
.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Fabiano continued, "With our continued investment in global marketing and sales activities, our fiscal year bookings reached a record high of $298 million and increased the demand for our unique technology from our key market verticals  military, critical infrastructure, ports, and borders.  Despite the global economic uncertainties, our sales pipeline reached an all-time high at the end of the fiscal year with new opportunities in the U.S., Middle East, APAC, Latin America, and Europe.  These achievements in the year were the result of the successful execution of our strategies to grow revenue and earnings to increase shareholder value over the long-term.

The situation has necessitated a realignment of our business strategy in order for us to recover and continue to drive expectations of healthy annual and long-term growth. In addition to adjustments in marketing strategies and resolution of some constraints on key projects, we've implemented cost cutting measures across the board to drive higher productivity as well as overall efficiency through business process re-engineering. We are confident in the measures we have taken to put us back on track."
 
Fabiano continued, "We are heading into fiscal year 2013 with a lot of positives on our side  a solid backlog, a robust pipeline, high-growth potential product developments, a very healthy balance sheet, and an extraordinary team of employees that are committed to top-notch performance. We remain absolute in our belief that AS&E is a best-in-class security company dedicated to supplying innovative inspection solutions to customers while delivering superior growth and income to our shareholders over the long term."

This is the second award from our key customer for the new port to create a best-in-class security solution.  Additionally, we are honored to have been awarded Best Explosives Detection Solution' for our ZBV by the 2012 GSN Homeland Security News magazine at the 2012 Homeland Security Awards.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
Effective March 1, 2013, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, amended and restated the Company's Bylaws (the "Bylaws") in order to change the voting standard for the election of directors from a plurality voting standard to a majority voting standard in uncontested elections.
 
The amendment provisions of Section 2.6, "Action by Vote", of the Bylaws are summarized below.
 
(a)  At any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Directors will continue to be elected by the vote of a plurality if, as of the fourteenth day preceding the filing of the Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange Committee, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election").
 
(b)  In order for an incumbent director to be nominated for election to the Board, that person must submit an irrevocable resignation as a member of the Board contingent on (x) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, and (y) acceptance of that resignation by the Board. If the incumbent fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election, the Board will act upon the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation and publicly disclose its decision within ninety days of the date of certification of the election results.
 
(c)  If the incumbent director's resignation is accepted, the Board may fill the vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.5 or decrease the size of the Board pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Bylaws

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 3.02
 
2.6  ACTION BY VOTE.
 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election; provided, that if as of the fourteenth (14th) day preceding the date the corporation files with the Securities and Exchange Commission for such meeting its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"),  directors shall be elected at such meeting by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this paragraph, a "majority of the votes cast" shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" or "withheld" from voting for that director's election.  Broker non-votes and abstentions shall not be counted as votes cast in the election of directors.
 
(b)  In order for any person to be nominated for election to the board of directors, such person must submit to the corporation an irrevocable resignation as a member of the board of directors contingent on (x) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (y) acceptance of that resignation by the board of directors. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the nominating and corporate governance committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The nominating and corporate governance committee in making its recommendation, and the board of directors in making its decision whether to accept a resignation, may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. Any director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election shall not participate in the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee or the decision of the board of directors with respect to his or her resignation.
 
(c)  If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this Section 2.6, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.5 or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1.
 
(d)  No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
 
(e)  A majority of the votes properly cast at any meeting at which a quorum is present upon any question other than the election of directors shall decide the question, except when a larger vote is required by law, by the articles of organization or by these bylaws.

A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing such appointment on March 14, 2013 is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
From 2010 to 2012, Mr. Dougherty served as president of the Communications and Industrial segment of Tyco Electronics Corporation, a global manufacturing business in the industrial, telecommunications, consumer-electronics, medical devices and solar energy market.

On March 13, 2013, the Company entered into an offer letter with Mr. Dougherty (the "Dougherty Offer Letter"), effective April 8, 2013.  The Dougherty Offer Letter includes the following material terms:
 
                 
Mr. Dougherty will be paid an annual base salary ("Base Salary") of $550,000, subject to possible increase by the Company's Board of Directors from time to time at its sole discretion.
                 
Mr. Dougherty will be eligible to participate in the Company's performance-based annual incentive compensation plan ("STIP") for the Company's senior executives, with a target bonus equal to 100% of his base salary.  The target bonus for fiscal year 2014 will be guaranteed, provided that Mr. Dougherty remains employed with the Company through the end of the fiscal year.
                 
Mr. Dougherty will be entitled to receive initial incentive awards, under the Company's long term incentive plan ("LTIP"), equal to 200% of his base salary.  Such awards may be in the form of restricted stock, stock options and/or cash as determined by the Board's compensation committee (the "Compensation Committee").

BILLERICA, Mass., March 14, 2013
 American Science and Engineering, Inc. ("AS&E") (NASDAQ: ASEI), a leading supplier of innovative X-ray detection solutions for government agencies, corporations and military organizations worldwide, today announced that Charles P. Dougherty has been named President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Anthony R. Fabiano, who is retiring.
 
Dougherty will become CEO on April 8, 2013.  The company's directors plan to elect him to the board that day.
 
Dougherty, 50, has been building telecommunications, fiber-optic and electronics-manufacturing businesses for more than 30 years.  He most recently was President of Tyco Electronic Corp.'s Communications and Industrial Segment, a global manufacturing business that annually sells $4.5 billion worth of products in the industrial, telecommunications, consumer-electronics, medical-devices and solar-energy markets.
 
"AS&E is known globally for its world-class inspection technologies that are a critical part of keeping us safe from terrorism," said Dougherty.  "I'm eager to join the company and help it to remain in the forefront of the design, manufacture and global marketing of its crucially important products."
 
Dougherty began his career at General Instrument, where in the 1980s he helped build one of the country's leading broadband networking businesses.  When General Instrument was acquired by Motorola in 2000, he took charge of Motorola's Voice-Over IP capability and built it into Motorola's Voice and Data Solutions, a premier provider of end-to-end IP networking businesses today.
 
In 2006, Dougherty joined Tyco International Corp., heading its $1 billion dollar wireless segment. Dougherty led the restructuring of the Tyco Electronics Wireless group that sells hardened communications technologies to public-safety agencies and first responders.  Tyco Electronics divested the public-safety unit to Harris Corp. in 2009 at which time Dougherty joined Harris Corp.  In 2010, Dougherty rejoined Tyco Electronics to manage and restructure the $4.5 billion Communications and Industrial Segment.
 
Denis R. Brown, Chairman of the AS&E Board, said, "We are particularly excited by Mr. Dougherty's experience building technology businesses with operations and markets around the world.  We look forward to collaborating closely with him as he works to expand our company's technology, revenue and global marketing reach."

ITEM 5.02.
                              
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On March 29, 2013, American Science and Engineering, Inc. (the "Company") entered into Change of Control & Severance Benefit Agreements, as Amended and Restated (the "2013 CiC Agreement"), previously approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, with Joseph Callerame, Robert Cline, Kenneth J. Galaznik, Paul H. Grazewski and Robert G. Postle (collectively, the "Executives").  These 2013 CiC Agreements replace expiring agreements covering the Executives (each, a "2011 CiC Agreement") and become effective on April 1, 2013 and terminate on March 31, 2014 (although the noncompetition provisions will continue to apply beyond such date).  All payments provided for in such agreements are contingent upon the Executive's providing an effective release of claims against the Company.
 
The 2013 CiC Agreement differs from the 2011 CiC Agreement in several ways, including (i) eliminating the provision for automatic renewal of the agreement, (ii) eliminating the augmented severance on certain terminations of employment between stockholder approval of a change in control and the consummation of the change in control, (iii) making slight revisions to the "Cause" definition (including omitting the cure provision with respect to breaches of restrictive covenants), (iv) trimming back the "Good Reason" definition (including raising the standard for Good Reason based on reductions in compensation and benefits), (v) eliminating the prior agreement provision that canceled the noncompetition obligations under this agreement upon certain employment terminations after a change in control, (vi) eliminating the payment of severance on a termination of employment as a result of death, and (vii) providing that payment by the Company for post-employment medical coverage under COBRA will only be made if and to the extent nondiscrimination rules permit.
 
Under the 2013 CiC Agreement, if, during the 24 month period following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2013 CiC Agreement), the Company terminates the Executive's employment other than for cause (as defined in the 2013 CiC Agreement) or the Executive terminates his employment with the Company for good reason (as defined in the 2013 CiC Agreement), the Executive will be eligible to receive (w) accrued compensation ("Accrued Compensation") consisting of (i) base salary and commissions (if any) earned but not paid; (ii) accrued but unpaid bonuses; and (iii) accrued but unpaid vacation, up to the date of termination; (x) severance pay equal to two times the Executive's base salary (or, if higher, his highest base salary in effect in the year before the Change in Control) plus the target short term incentive amount for the year of termination; (y) Company payment of COBRA premiums for the Executive, his spouse and dependent children for a period up to 18 months; and (z) immediate vesting of all unvested equity and certain cash-based awards.  The agreement also provides for acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity and certain cash-based awards on a Change in Control that does not result in his ceasing to be employed, if the acquirer is not assuming or replacing such awards.
 
Outside of a Change in Control and while the 2013 CiC Agreement remains in place, if the Company terminates the Executive's employment other than for cause or the Executive terminates his employment with the Company for good reason, the Executive will be eligible to receive (i) any Accrued Compensation; (ii) severance pay equal to one times the Executive's base salary; and (iii) Company payment of COBRA premiums for the Executive, his spouse and dependent children for a period up to 12 months.
 
The above summary of the 2013 CiC Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the actual agreement, a copy of the form of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, and which is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.

Executive shall cooperate reasonably with the Company in any effort by the Company to contest an IRS determination under this paragraph, including by the making of such filings and appeals as the Company may reasonably require, but nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Executive to bear any cost or expense of such a contest or in connection therewith to compromise any tax item (including without limitation any deduction or credit) other than the Section 4999 tax and related interest and penalties, if any, that are the subject of the contested IRS determination.  In the event of any underpayment or overpayment under this Agreement, as determined by the nationally recognized accounting firm, the amount of such underpayment or overpayment shall be promptly paid to Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may be, with interest at 120% of the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Payment Obligations Absolute
.  Upon a Change in Control Qualifying Termination or a Qualifying Termination, the Company's obligations to pay the benefits described in Section 4 or 5 as applicable shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company or any Affiliate may have against any Executive.

BILLERICA, Mass.  May 7, 2013 
American Science and Engineering, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASEI)
("AS&E")
, a leading worldwide supplier of innovative X-ray inspection solutions, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. The Company reported revenues of $42,280,000 as compared with revenues of $39,764,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, net income of $760,000 as compared with net income of $1,343,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, and earnings per share of $0.09 as compared with earnings per share of $0.15 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the Company reported revenues of $186,680,000 as compared with revenues of $203,552,000 for the prior fiscal year, net income of $17,454,000 as compared with net income of $21,422,000 for the prior fiscal year, and earnings per share of $2.07 as compared with earnings per share of $2.34 for the prior fiscal year.
 
The Company reported $8,771,000 in bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 as compared with $23,278,000 in bookings for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year and $180,310,000 in bookings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 as compared with the $180,895,000 in bookings for the prior fiscal year. Backlog at March 31, 2013 decreased 3% to $186,201,000 as compared to the year-end backlog of $192,571,000 at March 31, 2012.
 
"Fiscal year 2013 was challenging for AS&E," said Chuck Dougherty, AS&E's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Bookings were flat and revenues were down comparative to fiscal year 2012, and earnings were impacted by $0.48 due to the previously announced force reduction and the resolution of a contractual issue related to a multi-unit order to a strategic Middle Eastern customer. But fiscal year 2013 is behind us and it's time to look forward. On a positive note, we continue to buy back stock through our share repurchase program, our operations continue to generate positive cash flow, and the performance from our service contracts remains strong. Our position as the leader in advanced imaging technology, along with the domain expertise and capabilities of our organization and our strong financial position, gives us a great base from which to build."
 
The Company is declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on June 3, 2013 to the holders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2013.
