Cash and short-term investment balances at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2003 totaled $3.1 billion. "Both revenue and earnings were above the high end of estimates we provided on February 13, 2003, primarily as a result of stronger sales of analog products and continued strength in sales of DSP products," said Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "Analog product revenues grew 7% sequentially and accounted for approximately 78% of revenues, and DSP products grew 8% sequentially and accounted for approximately 22% of revenues."
"Growth this quarter was broad based with sales increasing across virtually all applications, across OEM and distributor channel customers and across all geographic regions," continued Mr. Fishman. "In the second quarter, orders for shipment in the next 13 weeks grew by approximately 16% from first quarter fiscal 2003 levels. Orders from both OEM customers and distributors grew sequentially and the book to bill ratio was well above one for the second quarter. Orders end customers placed with our distributors also grew sequentially and our distributors' book to bill ratio was above one." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We are planning for revenues to grow 3-5% sequentially during the third quarter. In addition, we are planning for gross margin to increase slightly. Operating expenses will increase slightly due to salary increases for a portion of the employee population. As a result, GAAP diluted EPS are estimated at $0.20 to $0.21 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003."

Exhibit 99.1 FOR RELEASE: NOVEMBER 18, 2003 4:00 P.M. EST ANALOG DEVICES REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 NORWOOD, Massachusetts - Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenues of $558 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of 22% compared to the same quarter one year ago and 7% above the immediately prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.23 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.09 for the same period one year ago and $0.21 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The fourth quarter results include a restructuring charge of $9.2 million ($0.02 per share) related to the decision to exit a small manufacturing business in Europe that was supplying foundry substrate services for optical applications. Excluding this charge, the diluted EPS would have been $0.25 for the fourth quarter. Revenues for the fiscal year 2003, which ended November 1, 2003, were $2.05 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Fiscal 2003 diluted EPS increased to $0.78, up from the fiscal 2002 EPS of $0.28. "The fourth quarter wrapped up what turned out to be a great year for ADI," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "Continuing strong orders led to fourth-quarter revenues coming in higher than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, with substantial contributions from both analog and DSP products. "In the fourth quarter, orders for shipment in the next 13 weeks grew by approximately 30% from the prior quarter. Orders grew in every region of the world and in both the distributor and OEM channels. Order growth continued to be the strongest in Asia as the digital consumer, wireless terminal and PC markets all posted strong results. We also saw strong demand from our broad base of customers serving all other end markets. "Gross margins for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 increased to 55.8% of sales, up from 55.1% of sales in the prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory fell to 106 days in the fourth quarter compared to 116 days in the previous quarter." Commenting on the balance sheet Mr. Fishman said, "The balance sheet continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter. Cash from operations was $105 million and capital expenditures were limited to $18 million, resulting in `free cash flow' of $87 million. During the quarter we redeemed our $1.2 billion of convertible debt and ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investment balances and no debt."
Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We are planning for the recovery that began seven quarters ago for ADI to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Demand accelerated during the fourth quarter and we are entering the first quarter with the highest level of backlog we have seen over the last two years. As a result, we are planning for revenues to grow approximately 5% sequentially and for EPS to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004." In a separate press release issued today, the company announced that the Board of Directors of ADI declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2003 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 28, 2003. Mr. Fishman will discuss the fourth quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 4:30pm EST.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ---------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated February 12, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices' First-Quarter Revenue Increases 30% Year-Over-Year, 9% Sequentially NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 12, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported that revenue rose 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $605.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on January 31, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $116.8 million. The first quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.30, up from $0.16 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.23 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 17, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. "As a result of customer demand that continued to strengthen throughout the first quarter, we achieved financial performance well ahead of our previous expectations and fiscal year 2004 is clearly off to a great start," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "We experienced solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth across the breadth of our high-performance analog and DSP product portfolio. "Shipments increased in all regions and end markets, particularly among the wide range of customers who design industrial and instrumentation systems, medical electronics, and automatic test equipment. Shipments to the consumer, communications, and computer end markets also grew during the quarter. "Gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to 57.1% of sales, up from 55.8% of sales in the prior quarter. Increasing gross margin coupled with tight expense control resulted in operating margins rising to 24.1% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet Mr. Fishman said, "Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Our cash and short-term investment balance grew by $190 million to $2.3 billion after $27 million of capital expenditures and a $15 million dividend payment. Days cost of sales in inventory declined to 103 days in the first quarter compared to 106 days in the previous quarter, while days sales in accounts receivable remained flat at 48 days." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Customer order patterns are providing us with the best visibility we have had in many quarters. As a result, our backlog of products requested to ship within the next 13 weeks has increased sequentially by 23% to $475 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we are planning for revenues to grow sequentially by approximately 7% to 10%, which is approximately $650 to $665 million, and for EPS to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.35." Taking a long-term view Mr. Fishman concluded, "We believe high-performance analog and DSP will continue to be among the fastest-growing product categories within the semiconductor industry and that ADI can continue to gain market share in these areas. The pervasiveness of signal processing throughout virtually all types of electronic equipment provides ADI with the opportunity for significant revenue growth over the next few years." Mr. Fishman will discuss the first quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 4:30 pm EST. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI." A replay will be available almost immediately after the call.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices' Second-Quarter Revenue Increases 35% Year-over-Year and Earnings Per Share More Than Double NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 13, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported revenue of $678.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on May 1. Revenue increased 35% compared to the same period one year ago and 12% compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $152.6 million, more than double the $71.3 million for the same period in the prior year and 31% above the $116.8 million in the immediately prior quarter. The second quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.39, up from $0.19 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.30 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 16, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 28, 2004. "We had an excellent quarter with revenue, margins, and EPS all well above our expectations when the quarter began," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "Demand continued to accelerate during the second quarter, driven by the widespread adoption of our high-performance analog and DSP core technology." "In the second quarter, we saw growth across each of the major end markets we serve. The highest growth came from consumer electronics and from the industrial market which represents a wide range of customers designing factory automation systems, test equipment, medical electronics, and scientific instrumentation. We also saw good revenue growth from the communications and computer markets. "On a geographic basis, the strongest revenue growth was from North America. Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia also had good growth within the quarter. "Gross margins rose to 59.2% of sales, a new peak for ADI and a 210 basis point improvement over the 57.1% we achieved in the immediately prior quarter. In addition, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 31.5%, a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. As a result, operating margins rose sequentially by 360 basis points to 27.7% of sales. "Our balance sheet also continued to strengthen in the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments grew by $235 million to $2.5 billion. Days cost of sales in inventory declined to 102 days in the second quarter compared to 103 days in the previous quarter, while days sales in accounts receivable declined to 44 days compared to 48 days in the previous quarter." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "The 13-week backlog continues to grow, reaching $571 million at the close of the second quarter, a 20% sequential increase. We are planning for revenue to grow sequentially by approximately 7% to 10% during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to approximately $725 to $745 million, with continuing strong operating leverage. As a result, we estimate EPS to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45."

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated August 12, 2004

EXHIBIT 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Results for Fiscal Third Quarter 2004 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 12, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported revenue of $717.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on July 31, 2004. Revenue increased 38% compared to the same period one year ago and 6% compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the third quarter was $169 million, more than double the $79 million reported for the same period in the prior year and 11% above the $152.6 million reported in the immediately prior quarter. The third quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.43, up from $0.21 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on September 15, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 27, 2004. "Our results in the third quarter were mixed, as margins improved and the balance sheet remained strong, but declining order rates led to slower than expected revenue growth," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "As a result, earnings came in at the low end of the guidance we provided on May 13, but earnings still grew at nearly twice the revenue growth rate for the quarter. "In the third quarter, we saw revenue growth across each of the major end markets we serve. The highest growth came from communications applications which span wireless, broadband, and a range of other telecommunications equipment. "On a geographic basis, revenue grew in most regions, led by 10% sequential growth in North America. Revenue in Europe and Southeast Asia also grew, while revenue in Japan was approximately flat. "Gross margins rose to 60% of sales, a new peak for ADI. In addition, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 31%, versus 31.5% in the immediately prior quarter. As a result, operating margins rose sequentially by 130 basis points to 29.0%, after rising 360 basis points last quarter." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Cash and short-term investments increased by $147 million to $2.69 billion. Days cost of sales in inventory was 104 days in the third quarter, up from 102 days in the second quarter, and well within our desired range of 100 to 110 days. Days sales in accounts receivable increased to 45 days compared to 44 days in the previous quarter." Commenting on order patterns, Mr. Fishman said, "Over the past three quarters, customers were ordering well ahead of consumption and the book-to-bill ratio was above 1.15. In the third quarter, the economy became more uncertain and since lead times shortened, customer and distributor order rates slowed. While our new orders during the third quarter were approximately equal to our sales, an unusually high level of cancellations resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.8 for the third quarter. Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Our customers appear somewhat more cautious in the short term and therefore, we are planning for fourth quarter revenue that is approximately flat compared to third quarter revenue. We also expect gross margins and EPS for the fourth quarter to be about the same as for the third quarter." In closing, Mr. Fishman stated, "The rebalancing that took place in the third quarter between order rates and consumption does nothing to change our mid- to long-term view. The electronics industry continues to grow and signal processing content within electronics equipment continues to grow. We believe these trends are likely to continue into the future and provide an opportunity for ADI to grow revenue and profits for 2005 and beyond." Mr. Fishman will discuss the third quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 4:30 pm EST. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI." A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 9078600 or by visiting the Investor Relations page on ADI's web site.

EXHIBIT 10.1 [ANALOG DEVICES LOGO] STOCK OPTION CONFIRMING MEMORANDUM GRANT OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION We are pleased to advise you that you have been granted an option to purchase________shares of Analog Devices, Inc. Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Option"). The grant of this option reflects Analog's confidence in your commitment and contributions to the success and continued growth of the Company. GRANT OF OPTION: This memorandum confirms that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Analog Devices, Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan ("the Plan"), Analog Devices, Inc. ("the Company") has granted to you ("the Optionee"), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below, an option to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Option Shares") as follows: Date of Grant: Number of Option Shares Granted: Option Exercise Price Per Share: ALL TERMS NOT DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERMS IN THE PLAN. EXERCISE OF OPTION: The Option is exercisable as follows: EXERCISE PERIOD NUMBER OF SHARES The right of exercise is cumulative, so that if the Option is not exercised to the maximum extent permissible during any period, it is exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares not so purchased at any time during any subsequent period prior to the expiration or termination of the Option. TERM OF OPTION; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT: 1. The term of the Option is ten (10) years after the Date of Grant, subject, however, to the early termination provisions set forth herein. 2. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Option shall be exercisable by the Optionee (or his/her successor in interest) following the termination of the Optionee's employment only to the extent that the Option was exercisable on or prior to the date of such termination. 3. The Option shall terminate on the date the Optionee voluntarily terminates employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries (except on retirement as provided below) or on the date his/her employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" (as defined in paragraph 4), but the Option Shares which are exercisable on the date of such termination shall continue to be exercisable for a period of three (3) months following such termination date. 4. The Option shall terminate on the date the Optionee's employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries is terminated by the Company for "Cause", and all Option Shares which are then exercisable shall forthwith cease to be exercisable. "Cause" for this purpose means unsatisfactory job performance (as determined by the Company), willful misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, disobedience or dishonesty. 5. Upon the death of the Optionee while he/she is an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, the Option shall become exercisable in full on the date of death and shall continue to be exercisable (by the Optionee's successor in interest) over the remaining term of the Option. 6. Upon the retirement of the employee, a fraction (the "Vesting Fraction") of the Option Shares which are not exercisable at the time of the Optionee's retirement shall, from and after such retirement, continue to be exercisable over the remaining term of the Option. The employment of the Optionee shall be deemed to terminate due to retirement if the Optionee terminates his or her employment voluntarily after having (i) attained age 62, (ii) completed at least ten years of vesting service as defined under the Analog Devices, Inc. The Investment Partnership ("TIP") and (iii) prior to termination of employment had completed an orderly transition of his or her duties and responsibilities. The Vesting Fraction means the fraction determined by subtracting 72 from the sum of (a) the Optionee's age and (b) the Optionee's years of service determined at the date of termination of employment and dividing the result of that calculation by 10.
[ANALOG DEVICES LOGO] 7. If the employment of the Optionee terminates due to disability (as determined by the Company), the Option Shares which are not exercisable as of the date of disability shall become exercisable on the date or dates (over the remaining term of the Option) that they otherwise would have been exercisable if the Optionee's employment had not been terminated due to disability. As used herein, the terms "employment" and "employee" shall mean and include any one of the following relationships with the Company: director, employee, consultant or advisor. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE: The following payment methods may be used to purchase Option Shares: 1. A cashless exercise in a manner described in the Plan. 2. Cash or check payable to the Company. 3.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Updates Outlook for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2004 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 2004--Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) today revised its revenue outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter ending October 30, 2004 to approximately $630 to $640 million, down approximately 10% to 12% from the immediately prior quarter. Earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles are estimated to be between $0.33 and $0.35 for the fourth quarter. Analog Devices has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. today to answer analysts' questions regarding the revised outlook. Investors may listen via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI." "Order rates did not improve in the quarter as we had expected," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "On August 12, 2004 when we provided guidance for the fourth quarter, we explained that we had begun to see a general softening of orders, which had reduced opening backlog to a level that would require approximately 50% turns (orders received and shipped within the quarter) to achieve flat sequential revenue. August was weak as expected, but the pick-up we hoped would occur in September and accelerate in October did not materialize. As a result, we have lowered our revenue outlook." Commenting on the end markets, Mr. Fishman continued, "The majority of the weakness occurred in SEA and Japan and was primarily in wireless handsets, wireless infrastructure, semiconductor capital equipment and, to a lesser degree, in consumer products. In wireless communications, inventory build-up coupled with economic constraints imposed by the Chinese government impacted considerably our sales in the region. ADI's significant market share in China, while a negative in the very short term, gives us a strong position from which to grow our revenue in the region as the Chinese economy stabilizes. In semiconductor capital equipment, ADI has always enjoyed a very significant share of the analog content in automatic test equipment (ATE). As the short term outlook for the semiconductor market became more uncertain, our largest ATE customers in the U.S. and Japan cut back orders, adjusting their inventories to the reality of lower capital spending in the short term. In the consumer market, ADI commands very high market share in a wide range of consumer electronics products. In the first half of this year, revenue from consumer customers grew substantially. As consumer sentiment became more uncertain over the past few months, our consumer electronics customers moved to adjust their inventories very quickly. As a result, ADI experienced reduced orders for some products sold into consumer applications. ADI revenue from each of these end markets should increase substantially year-over-year, but it now seems clear that the hyper growth we experienced earlier in the year has caused some correction which we are now experiencing at the end of our fiscal year. In the U.S. distribution channel, which represents tens of thousands of customers in virtually every end market, our revenue will likely be relatively flat sequentially after growing substantially earlier in the year." Regarding company margins, Mr. Fishman commented, "At these revenue levels, we expect gross margins should decline only slightly. Our strategy of aligning with our foundry partners for production of our most volatile products coupled with the very long life cycles of our internally produced products and substantial manufacturing cost reductions during the last cycle, should allow continued strong gross margins provided the industry outlook does not worsen significantly. We anticipate that expenses for the quarter should be down approximately 2% sequentially due to actions taken to control expenses as orders weakened and also given that some expenses are variable with volume. This should provide operating profit before taxes of approximately 25% and EPS in the $0.33-$0.35 range." Regarding various balance sheet items, Mr. Fishman continued, "Inventories are likely to rise by approximately $30 million as a result of lower revenue and reductions in inventory at distributors. Our cash balance for the fourth quarter should remain approximately flat at $2.7 billion, after repurchasing approximately $137 million of common stock, spending $40 million in capital expenses, and paying $23 million in dividends." ADI will provide an outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, which ends on January 29, 2005 in the company's scheduled November 23, 2004 fourth quarter earnings release. Mr. Fishman provided these general comments regarding the near term outlook, "At a high level, we see mixed signals for the first fiscal quarter. On the positive side, ADI has experienced more volatility in our order patterns than our customers have seen in orders from their own end customers. This tells us that most of the volatility is related to the supply chain and only a small fraction is related to long term end market weaknesses. This behavior is somewhat typical since customers tend to adjust inventories rapidly as the outlook becomes somewhat uncertain. Our customers tell us that their business remains healthy and we believe the design in rates of our newest products remain strong. ADI has already absorbed significant inventory reductions from many of our largest customers. In particular, feedback from customers in China indicates inventory levels are low and government constraints are likely to end later this year or early next year. Overall, while cancellations were higher than expected early in the quarter, they have reduced to more normal levels in the past 4 to 6 weeks. Also on the positive side is the fact that our broad customer base seems to be stable with inventory in reasonably good shape. On the more cautionary side, ADI's backlog is currently below where it was when the quarter began. Customers are waiting until the last minute to place orders given their cautionary stance and ADI's short lead times. Finally, we are heading into the first fiscal quarter which seasonally has fewer business days due to the holiday periods." Mr. Fishman summarized the company's estimated results for the fiscal year saying, "Despite the revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, ADI's results for the fiscal year should be strong with sales growth of approximately 29%, well ahead of our model of 20-25%; a four-point improvement in gross margins for the entire year; and earnings growth of over 85%, nearly three times our revenue growth." The estimated cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 should be approximately $750 million before capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, common stock repurchases of approximately $137 million, and $75 million in dividend payments. Overall cash balances should increase by over half a billion dollars in fiscal 2004. In conclusion, Mr. Fishman said, "These results continue to substantiate that high performance analog and DSP remain the best product spaces in the entire semiconductor industry and over many years should continue to provide sales and earnings growth well above industry average levels." Analog Devices will host a conference call to answer analysts' questions regarding the update today, October 21, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2004 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 23, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $632 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended October 30, 2004. Revenue increased 13% compared to the same quarter one year ago and decreased 12% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.34 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.23 for the same period one year ago and down from $0.43 for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on December 22, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on December 3, 2004. Revenue for the fiscal year 2004 was $2.63 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Fiscal 2004 diluted EPS increased to $1.45, up from the fiscal 2003 diluted EPS of $0.78. "Fiscal year 2004 turned out to be a record sales year for ADI, despite the fourth quarter's sequential revenue decline," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Annual revenue increased 29% compared to fiscal 2003. For the past two-year period, our revenue growth averaged approximately 25% per year." Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 59.5%, up 370 basis points from the same quarter last year and down 50 basis points from the immediately prior quarter. For fiscal year 2004, gross margins increased to 59%, up from 54.9% for fiscal year 2003. Mr. Fishman continued, "Operating expenses for the fourth quarter declined 2% sequentially and were up 9% compared to the same period last year. Operating expenses for the fiscal year 2004 rose by 14% compared to fiscal 2003, less than half the growth rate of revenue over the same period. "Operating profits for the fourth quarter totaled $158 million or 25% of sales. For the fiscal year 2004, operating profit grew by 87%, three times the revenue growth rate for the same period." During fiscal year 2004, net cash from operations was $778 million, or 29.5% of sales, an increase of $345 million from the $433 million recorded in the prior year. The company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $137 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were $146 million and the company paid dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased $568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million on October 30, 2004. In the fourth quarter, inventory rose sequentially by approximately $20 million, resulting in days cost of sales in inventory increasing to 123 days as compared to 104 days in the immediately prior quarter. Regarding the change in inventory, Mr. Fishman commented, "Although above ADI's goal of 100 to 110 days, these inventory levels remain within typical fluctuations given the current business volatility. "Accounts receivable balances remained under good control. Days sales in accounts receivable at 48 days for the fourth quarter was up from 45 days in the immediately prior quarter but flat compared to the same period one year ago." Turning to the end markets, Mr. Fishman explained, "The wireless communications and automatic test equipment (ATE) end markets were weakest during the fourth quarter, declining by $62 million in aggregate compared to the third quarter. However, for the fiscal year 2004, revenue from each of these end markets was up significantly. "Revenue from our broad base of industrial customers, representing many diverse end markets, grew by approximately 32% year-over-year and totaled approximately 36% of sales in fiscal year 2004. The breadth and performance of our product portfolio and our leading brand continue to differentiate ADI from our competition. In 2004, we further strengthened our position with the introduction of a multitude of converter, amplifier, power management, MEMS, and DSP products for a wide range of applications across the industrial markets. "For the fiscal year 2004, revenue from products sold to communications customers grew approximately 30% year-over-year and represented approximately 37% of sales. We experienced strong growth from a variety of communications applications, including cellular base stations, wireless handsets, and many types of networking equipment. "Consumer electronics products are increasingly integrating high-performance audio, video, and imaging technology from ADI and, in fiscal year 2004, revenue from consumer customers increased approximately 34% year-over-year. Consumer applications represented approximately 13% of sales for the year. "For the fiscal year 2004, revenue from computer customers grew approximately 14% year-over-year and represented approximately 14% of sales. We have continued to diversify our power management products toward notebook and other portable systems and our CPU temperature monitoring technology is increasingly important in PC motherboard design. "On a geographic basis, approximately one third of the fourth quarter revenue decline was attributed to China, one third to Japan, and one third throughout the rest of the world. "For the fiscal year 2004, revenue increased in all regions. Comparing fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2003, revenue from North America increased approximately 24%, Europe increased approximately 20%, Japan increased approximately 36%, China increased approximately 73%, and the rest of Asia increased approximately 16%," said Mr. Fishman. In the fourth quarter, analog product revenue grew 14% compared to the same period one year ago, and declined 13% from the immediately prior quarter. DSP product revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10% compared to the same period one year ago, and declined 9% from the immediately prior quarter. For the fiscal year 2004, revenue from analog products grew 31% year-over-year and represented approximately 79% of sales while DSP product revenue grew 21% year-over-year and totaled approximately 21% of sales. Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "As we outlined in our October 21, 2004 release, there remain many mixed-signals surrounding the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Order volatility has abated, cancellations have returned to more normal levels, and customers tell us their end demand continues to grow. However, in the short term, ADI is shipping below end market consumption as customers continue to reduce their inventory. As a result, our backlog entering first quarter is low, and we will be dependent on high turns orders during a quarter with fewer business days due to the holiday season. Therefore, we remain cautious regarding ADI's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. "We are currently planning for first quarter fiscal 2005 revenue to be approximately $575 million to $600 million, gross margins to remain strong at 58% to 59%, and operating expenses to decline sequentially 3% to 4%. Based on these assumptions, we expect diluted EPS to be approximately $0.28 to $0.31. "Aggregating a number of factors, we expect ADI revenue growth to resume in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005." Mr. Fishman went on to explain, "Most importantly, much of the inventory build-up that has caused recent volatility is likely to be absorbed by the end of the first quarter. This should result in order rates and sales patterns in the second quarter that are more in-line with actual consumption of our products. "We also believe that the first quarter will represent the cyclical low of shipments to ATE customers. "Our market share in China, while currently a drag to revenue, should be a positive factor for the second quarter and beyond as government economic restrictions dissipate and growth returns to above average levels. In China, our revenue grew approximately 75% per year for the last two years and represented approximately 14% of sales for fiscal year 2004. "In addition, order rates from end customers to our distributors were well ahead of distributor order rates on ADI during the fourth quarter, indicating distribution order rates are also below end consumption rates of our products. "Lastly, our second quarter is typically a stronger seasonal quarter for ADI as we benefit from our broad base of customers serving the industrial end markets." Regarding the long-term outlook Mr. Fishman commented, "We remain optimistic that 2005 will be another good year for ADI. The breadth of applications we serve continues to expand and the content we deliver per application continues to increase. We begin fiscal 2005 with a strong product portfolio across an ever widening range of applications from digital cameras, advanced digital televisions, and wireless communications, to automobiles, Internet set-top boxes, medical imaging, and security monitoring systems. Our high-performance analog, DSP, and MEMS core technology is well-positioned to capture these and many more opportunities for continued growth in our future."

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") has approved the terms of a bonus plan for fiscal year 2005 (the "Bonus Plan"). The Bonus Plan is substantially the same as the bonus plan in effect for fiscal year 2004. The Bonus Plan is based on the Company's operating profit before taxes as a percentage of the Company's sales for each fiscal quarter. This percentage is used to calculate "The Bonus Payout Factor". The Bonus Payout Factor may not exceed three for any given bonus period. An eligible employee's potential gross payment under the Bonus Plan is the result obtained by multiplying the Bonus Payout Factor by the employee's eligible earnings by the employee's individual bonus target percentage. The bonus target percentage (which represents a percentage of an individual's eligible earnings) used in the bonus calculation varies by job level.
     Distributions, if any, under the Bonus Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and paid out in approximately June 2005 and December 2005 based on local payroll cycles.
     Most of the Company's employees (other than sales staff on commission plans) are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan if they are actively employed, and in good standing, during the applicable bonus period and remain employed through their last regularly scheduled work day of the bonus period. New employees are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan during their first full fiscal quarter of employment with the Company.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On December 7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company voted to amend and restate the Bylaws of the Company primarily to reflect various provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, Chapter 156D, which became effective on July 1, 2004.
     The amended and restated bylaws were effective immediately. The full text of the amended and restated bylaws is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS OF ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
. . . BYLAWS Table of Contents -i-
-ii-
ARTICLE I SHAREHOLDERS 1.1. Annual Meeting. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of shareholders at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and stated in the notice of the meeting. The purposes for which the annual meeting is to be held, in addition to those prescribed by the Articles of Organization, shall be for electing Directors and for such other purposes as shall be specified in the notice for the meeting, and only business within such purposes may be conducted at the meeting. In the event an annual meeting is not held at the time fixed in accordance with these Bylaws or the time for an annual meeting is not fixed in accordance with these Bylaws to be held within 13 months after the last annual meeting, the Corporation may designate a special meeting as a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting, and such meeting shall have all of the effect of an annual meeting. 1.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, and shall be called by the Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the Secretary, by another officer, if the holders of at least 80 percent, or such lesser percentage as shall constitute the maximum percentage permitted by law for this purpose at any time at which the Corporation shall have a class of voting stock registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary one or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held. Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice may be conducted at a special shareholders' meeting. 1.3. Place of Meetings. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation unless a different place is fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and specified in the notice of the meeting. 1.4. Requirement of Notice. A written notice of the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders' meeting describing the purposes of the meeting shall be given to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting (and, to the extent required by law or the Articles of Organization, to shareholders not entitled to vote at the meeting) no fewer than seven nor more than 60 days before the meeting date. If an annual or special meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed, however, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under this Section 1.4 to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. All notices to shareholders shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws. No business may be transacted at a meeting of shareholders except that (a) specified in the notice thereof, or in a supplemental notice given also in compliance with the provisions hereof, (b) brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the presiding officer, or (c) properly brought before the meeting by or on behalf of any shareholder who (i) is entitled to propose a matter for consideration at the meeting, (ii) shall have been a -1-
shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 1.4 and who shall continue to be entitled to vote thereat and (iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 or, with respect to the election of directors, Section 1.9 of these Bylaws. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before a meeting by a shareholder (other than a shareholder proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act), the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received in writing by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation as follows: (i) in the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and (B) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; or (ii) in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting and (y) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a shareholders' meeting (or the public announcement thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice. Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (b) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation held of record, owned beneficially and represented by proxy by such shareholder as of the record date for the meeting (if such date shall then have been made publicly available) and as of the date of such notice by the shareholder, and (d) all other information which would be required to be included in a proxy statement or other filings required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission if, with respect to any such item of business, such shareholder were a participant in a solicitation subject to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting of shareholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1.4 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any business properly brought before such meeting. Nothing in this Section 1.4 shall grant to any shareholder the right to propose a matter for consideration at any meeting of shareholders, or obligate the Corporation to provide notice to shareholders of any shareholder proposal, except to the extent such shareholder has such right, or the Corporation has such obligation, under applicable federal or state law. -2-
The Chairman of the Board or other presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, and if such officer should so determine, such officer shall so declare to the meeting and that business shall be disregarded. For purposes of this Section 1.4, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 1.5. Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive any notice required by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing, be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with the records of the meeting. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting: (a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 1.6. Quorum. (a) Unless otherwise provided by law, or in the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring satisfaction of a greater quorum requirement for any voting group, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. As used in these Bylaws, a voting group includes all shares of one or more classes or series that, under the Articles of Organization or the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as in effect from time to time (the "MBCA"), are entitled to vote and to be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders. (b) A share once represented for any purpose at a meeting is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless (1) the shareholder attends solely to object to lack of notice, defective notice or the conduct of the meeting on other grounds and does not vote the shares or otherwise consent that they are to be deemed present, or (2) in the case of an adjournment, a new record date is or shall be set for that adjourned meeting. 1.7. Voting and Proxies. (a) Except as provided in this Section 1.7(a) or unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders' meeting. Only shares are entitled to vote, and each fractional share, if any, is entitled to a proportional vote. Absent special circumstances, the shares of the Corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by another entity of which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting interests; provided, however, that nothing in these Bylaws shall limit the power of the -3-
Corporation to vote any shares held by it, directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary capacity. Unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after notice of redemption is given to the holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price upon surrender of the shares. (b) A shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment form, an appointment is valid for a period of 11 months from the date the shareholder signed the form or, if it is undated, from the date of its receipt by the officer or agent. An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, as defined in the MBCA. An appointment made irrevocable is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy shall not affect the right of the Corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment. A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he or she did not know of its existence when he or she acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.24 of the MBCA, or any successor Section thereto, and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment. 1.8. Action at Meeting. If a quorum of a voting group exists, favorable action on a matter, other than the election of Directors, is taken by a voting group if the votes cast within the group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by law, the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring receipt of a greater affirmative vote of the shareholders, including more separate voting groups. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. No ballot shall be required for such election unless requested by a shareholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election. 1.9. Nomination of Directors. (a) Except for (1) any Directors entitled to be elected by the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, (2) any Directors elected by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 2.3 of these Bylaws to fill vacancies or newly created directorships or (3) as otherwise required by applicable law or stock market regulation, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures in this Section 1.9 shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nomination for election to the Board of Directors at a meeting of shareholders may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (x) complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.9(b) and (y) is a -4-
shareholder of record on the date of the giving of such notice and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting. (b) To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received in writing by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation as follows: (i) in the case of an election of Directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and (B) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; or (ii) in the case of an election of Directors at a special meeting of shareholders, provided that the Board of Directors has determined that Directors shall be elected at such meeting, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting and (y) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a shareholders' meeting (or the public announcement thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice. The shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (A) as to each proposed nominee (1) such person's name, age, business address and, if known, residence address, (2) such person's principal occupation or employment, (3) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, and (4) any other information concerning such person that must be disclosed as to nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; (B) as to the shareholder giving the notice (1) such shareholder's name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, (2) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned, beneficially and of record, by such shareholder, (3) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such shareholder, (4) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person(s) named in its notice and (5) a representation whether the shareholder intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such nomination; and (C) as to the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made (1) such beneficial owner's name and address, (2) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such beneficial owner, (3) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such beneficial owner and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made and (4) a representation whether the beneficial owner intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise -5-
to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such nomination. In addition, to be effective, the shareholder's notice must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a Director if elected. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation. A shareholder shall not have complied with this Section 1.9(b) if the shareholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made) solicits or does not solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9. (c) The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9 (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in compliance with the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9), and if the chairman should determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such nomination shall be disregarded. (d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.9 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include in any proxy statement or other shareholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect to any nominee for Director submitted by a shareholder. (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.9, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to present a nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.9, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders. (f) For purposes of this Section 1.9, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 1.10. Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate, including without limitation such guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of shareholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the -6-
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or attorneys or such other persons as shall be determined; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. 1.11. Action Without Meeting by Written Consent. (a) Action taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents that describe the action taken, are signed by shareholders having the requisite votes, bear the date of the signatures of such shareholders, and are delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with the records of meetings within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this Section 1.11. A consent signed under this Section 1.11 has the effect of a vote at a meeting. (b) If action is to be taken pursuant to the consent of voting shareholders without a meeting, the Corporation, at least seven days before the action pursuant to the consent is taken, shall give notice, which complies in form with the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws, of the action to nonvoting shareholders in any case where such notice would be required by law if the action were to be taken pursuant to a vote by voting shareholders at a meeting. The notice shall contain, or be accompanied by, the same material that would have been required by law to be sent to shareholders in or with the notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for approval. 1.12. Record Date. The Board of Directors may fix the record date in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action. If a record date for a specific action is not fixed by the Board of Directors, and is not supplied by law, the record date shall be (a) the close of business either on the day before the first notice is sent to shareholders, or, if no notice is sent, on the day before the meeting or (b) in the case of action without a meeting by written consent, the date the first shareholder signs the consent or (c) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting of shareholders, the date the first shareholder signs the demand or (d) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares, the date the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution. A record date fixed under this Section 1.12 may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. -7-
1.13. Meetings by Remote Communication. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Organization, if authorized by the Board of Directors: subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may, by means of remote communication: (a) participate in a meeting of shareholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of shareholders, provided that: (1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxyholder; (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (3) if any shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 1.14. Form of Shareholder Action. (a) Any vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder shall be considered given in writing, dated and signed, if, in lieu of any other means permitted by law, it consists of an electronic transmission that sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (1) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder, proxy or agent or by a person authorized to act for the shareholder, proxy or agent; and (2) the date on which such shareholder, proxy, agent or authorized person transmitted the electronic transmission. The date on which the electronic transmission is transmitted shall be considered to be the date on which it was signed. The electronic transmission shall be considered received by the Corporation if it has been sent to any address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of shareholders. (b) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any purpose for which the original writing could be used, but the copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 1.15. Shareholder List for Meeting. (a) After fixing a record date for a shareholders' meeting, the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder, but need not include an electronic mail address or other electronic contact information for any shareholder. -8-
(b) The list of shareholders shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice is given of the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting: (1) at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held; or (2) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. (c) A shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of Section 6.2(c) of these Bylaws, to copy the list, during regular business hours and at his or her expense, during the period it is available for inspection. (d) The Corporation shall make the list of shareholders available at the meeting, and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment. ARTICLE II DIRECTORS 2.1. Powers. All corporate power shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of, its Board of Directors. 2.2. Number and Election. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than the minimum number of individuals permitted by law and, subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, shall be divided into three classes, such classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, at each annual meeting of shareholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected. Subject to the foregoing requirements and applicable law, the Board of Directors may, from time to time, fix the number of Directors and their respective classifications, provided that any such action does not operate to remove a Director elected by the shareholders or the Directors other than in the manner specified in the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws. 2.3. Vacancies. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, vacancies and newly created directorships, whether resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a Director or otherwise, shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new Director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. 2.4. Change in Size of Board of Directors. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the number of Directors may be fixed or changed from time to time by the Board of Directors. -9-
2.5. Tenure. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, each Director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting at which such Director was elected; provided, however, that each Director designated as a Class I Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2005; each Director designated as a Class II Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2006; and each Director designated as a Class III Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2007; and provided further, however, that the term of each Director shall continue until the election and qualification of a successor and be subject to such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the vacancy occurred or the new directorship was created and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. 2.6. Resignation. A Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice of resignation to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 2.7. Removal. A Director may be removed from office (a) with or without cause by vote of a majority of the stockholders entitled to vote in the election of Directors, provided that the Directors of a class elected by a particular class of stockholders may be removed only by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or (b) for cause by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office. A Director may be removed for cause only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove him. To the extent that any of the provisions in this Section 2.7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any of the provisions of Section 8.06 of the MBCA, as amended from time to time, the provisions of Section 8.06 shall govern and control. 2.8. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such times and places as shall from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting. A regular meeting may be held without a call or notice at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, following such meeting of shareholders. 2.9. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, any two Directors or one Director in the event that there is only one Director. 2.10. Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors must be preceded by at least two days' notice of the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special meeting. All notices to Directors shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws. -10-
2.11. Waiver of Notice. A Director may waive any notice before or after the date and time of the meeting. The waiver shall be in writing, signed by the Director entitled to the notice, or in the form of an electronic transmission by the Director to the Corporation, and filed with the minutes or corporate records. A Director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. 2.12. Quorum. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws, a quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a majority of the Directors then in office, provided always that any number of Directors (whether one or more and whether or not constituting a quorum) constituting a majority of Directors present at any meeting or at any adjourned meeting may make an adjournment thereof. 2.13. Action at Meeting. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of the Board of Directors unless the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of Directors. A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors when corporate action is taken is considered to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he or she objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (b) his or her dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) he or she delivers written notice of his or her dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a Director who votes in favor of the action taken. 2.14. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by the unanimous consent of the members of the Board of Directors. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action taken, in writing, signed by each Director, or delivered to the Corporation by electronic transmission, to the address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of Directors, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 2.14 is effective when the last Director signs or delivers the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. A consent signed or delivered under this Section 2.14 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. 2.15. Telephone Conference Meetings. The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to be present in person at the meeting. 2.16. Committees. The Board of Directors may create one or more committees and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them. Each committee may have one or more members, who serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The creation of a committee -11-
and appointment of members to it must be approved by a majority of all the Directors in office when the action is taken. Article III and Sections 2.10 through 2.15 of these Bylaws shall apply to committees and their members. To the extent specified by the Board of Directors, each committee may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors to the extent permitted by law. The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a Director with the standards of conduct described in Section 2.18 of these Bylaws. 2.17. Compensation. The Board of Directors may fix the compensation of Directors. 2.18. Standard of Conduct for Directors. (a) A Director shall discharge his or her duties as a Director, including his or her duties as a member of a committee: (1) in good faith; (2) with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation. In determining what the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, a Director may consider the interests of the Corporation's employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state, the region and the nation, community and societal considerations, and the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation. (b) In discharging his or her duties, a Director who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent with respect to the information, opinions, reports or statements presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons retained by the Corporation, as to matters involving skills or expertise the Director reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular person's professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person merits confidence; or (3) a committee of the Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence. (c) A Director is not liable for any action taken as a Director, or any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or her office in compliance with this Section 2.18. 2.19. Conflict of Interest. (a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the Corporation in which a Director of the Corporation has a material direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the Corporation solely because of the Director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true: (1) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; -12-
(2) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or (3) the transaction was fair to the Corporation. (b) For purposes of this Section 2.19, and without limiting the interests that may create conflict of interest transactions, a Director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if: (1) another entity in which he or she has a material financial interest or in which he or she is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or (2) another entity of which he or she is a director, officer or trustee or in which he or she holds another position is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board of Directors. (c) For purposes of clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors on the Board of Directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Section 2.19 by a single Director. If a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection. (d) For purposes of clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection (d). Shares owned by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in clause (1) of subsection (b) of this Section 2.19, may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19. The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other provisions of these Bylaws. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19. ARTICLE III MANNER OF NOTICE All notices provided for under these Bylaws shall conform to the following requirements: (a) Notice shall be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice by electronic transmission is written notice. (b) Notice may be communicated in person; by telephone, voice mail, telegraph, teletype or other electronic means; by mail; by electronic transmission; or by messenger or delivery service. If these forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be -13-
communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published; or by radio, television or other form of public broadcast communication.

(d) Written notice by electronic transmission, if in comprehensible form, is effective: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the addressee of such specific posting, directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the addressee in such manner as the addressee shall have specified to the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. (e) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this Article III, written notice, other than notice by electronic transmission, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following: (1) when received; (2) five days after its deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; (3) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; or if sent by messenger or delivery service, on the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (4) on the date of publication if notice by publication is permitted. (f) Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner. ARTICLE IV OFFICERS 4.1. Enumeration.

If a resignation is made effective at a later date and the Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board of Directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board of Directors provides that the successor shall not take office until the effective date. An officer's resignation shall not affect the Corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer. 4.6. Removal. The Board of Directors may remove any officer at any time with or without cause. An officer's removal shall not affect the officer's contract rights, if any, with the Corporation. 4.7. Vacancies.

An officer shall not be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for any decision to take or not to take any action taken, or any failure to take any action, as an officer, if the duties of the officer are performed in compliance with this Section 4.14. ARTICLE V PROVISIONS RELATING TO SHARES 5.1. Issuance and Consideration. The Board of Directors may issue the number of shares of each class or series authorized by the Articles of Organization. The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the Corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the Corporation. Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. The Board of Directors shall determine the terms upon which the rights, options or warrants for the purchase of shares or other securities of the Corporation are issued and the terms, including the consideration, for which the shares or other securities are to be issued. 5.2. Share Certificates. If shares are represented by certificates, at a minimum each share certificate shall state on its face: (a) the name of the Corporation and that it is organized under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (b) the name of the person to whom issued; and (c) the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents. Every certificate for shares of stock that are subject to any restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of such shares pursuant to the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws, an agreement among shareholders or an agreement among shareholders and the Corporation, shall have conspicuously noted on the front or back of such certificate the existence -17-
of such restrictions. If different classes of shares or different series within a class are authorized, then the variations in rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class and series, and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine variations for any future class or series, must be summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back that the Corporation will furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge. Each share certificate shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or any two officers designated by the Board of Directors, and may bear the corporate seal or its facsimile. If the person who signed, either manually or in facsimile, a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate shall be nevertheless valid. 5.3. Uncertificated Shares. The Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporation's classes or series without certificates. The authorization shall not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required by the MBCA to be on certificates. 5.4. Transfers; Record and Beneficial Owners. Subject to the restrictions, if any, stated or noted on the stock certificates, shares of stock may be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of attorney properly executed, and with such proof of authority or the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the record holder of shares as shown on its books as the owner of such shares for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and other distributions and the right to vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other disposition of such shares until the shares have been transferred on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the requirements of these Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Board of Directors has established a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee will be recognized by the Corporation as a shareholder, the Corporation shall be entitled to treat the beneficial owner of shares as the shareholder to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with the Corporation. 5.5. Replacement of Certificates. The Board of Directors may, subject to applicable law, determine the conditions upon which a new share certificate may be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of such share certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give a bond, sufficient in its opinion, with or without surety, to indemnify the Corporation against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issue of the new certificate. -18-

ARTICLE VI PAYMENT OF BENEFITS 6.1 PAYMENT OF DEFERRAL BENEFIT Upon the death, Disability, or Retirement of a Participant, the Employer shall pay to the Participant or his Beneficiary a Deferral Benefit equal to the vested balance of his or her Account determined pursuant to Article V, less applicable withholding, based on his election in accordance with Section 6.4. The distribution shall be subject to any waiting period required by Section 409A with respect to Participants who are Key Employees as defined therein. Elections with respect to such payment made under the Plan prior to the effective date of this amendment and restatement shall continue in effect until changed in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI and the Administrative Procedures. Upon a Change in Control or upon a Participant's separation from service for reasons other than death, Disability, or Retirement, the Employer shall pay to the Participant a Deferral Benefit in a lump sum equal to the vested balance of his or her Account determined pursuant to Article V, less applicable withholdings, as soon as administratively practicable; provided that such distribution shall be subject to any waiting period required by Section 409A with respect to Key Employees as defined therein. 6.2 PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES. In the event of the Participant's death prior to his or her receipt of his or her entire vested Account, the vested balance shall be distributed to his or her Beneficiary as determined under Article VII, in a lump sum; provided that if the Participant was receiving installment distributions at the time of death, or had made an installment election pursuant to Section 6.4 at least 12 months prior to death, the Beneficiary will receive the annual installments at such times as such installments would have become distributable to the Participant. 6.3 UNFORSEEABLE EMERGENCY In the event that the Committee, upon request of a Participant, determines, that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency the Employer shall distribute to the Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, the amounts provided for under this Section 6.3. Such distribution shall consist of an amount necessary to meet the emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), but not exceeding the aggregate balance of such Participant's Deferral Account as of the date of such payment. The amount of the Deferral Benefit otherwise payable under the Plan to such Participant shall be adjusted to reflect the early payment of the Unforseeable Emergency. Any distribution under this Section 6.3 shall be made only to the extent that it is in compliance with Section 409A. 12
6.4 FORM OF PAYMENT. The Deferral Benefit payable pursuant to Section 6.1 on death, Disability or Retirement, shall be paid in one of the following forms as further described in the Administrative Procedures, as elected by the Participant. The Participant shall elect the form of such distribution at the time he or she first completes the Participation Election and such election shall apply to the entire amount of the Participant's vested Account. (a) Installments; or, (b) A lump sum. In the event a Participant fails to make a distribution election, his or her vested Account Balance shall be distributed as a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after his or her separation from service, death or Disability; subject to such waiting period as required by Section 409A with respect to a Key Employee as defined therein. 6.5 COMMENCEMENT OF PAYMENTS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the distribution of a lump sum or the commencement of installment payments under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the Plan shall begin following an event which entitles a Participant (or a Beneficiary) to payments under the Plan and the end of any waiting period required with respect to such Participant as required by Section 409A. 6.6 SMALL BENEFIT. In the event the Committee determines that the vested balance of a Participant's Account is less than $10,000 at the time of commencement of payments, or the portion of the vested balance of the Participant's Account payable to any Beneficiary is less than $10,000 at the time of commencement of payments to such Beneficiary, the Committee may inform the Employer and the Employer, will pay the entire amount in the form of a lump sum payment, notwithstanding any Participant election to the contrary. 6.7 CHANGES IN FORM OF BENEFIT A Participant's election to change the form in which his or her benefit is to be paid under Section 6.1 on death, Disability or Retirement, shall, to the extent required by Section 409A, meet the following requirements: (a) the new election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made; and (b) in the case of an election related to a payment other than Disability or death, the payment with respect to which such change is made must be deferred for a period of not less than 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made. 13
6.8 SPECIAL 2005 DISTRIBUTION AND ELECTION CHANGES To the extent and in the manner permitted under Section 409A, and at the election of any Participant, the following distributions and election changes may be made, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures: (a) All or any part of the Account may be withdrawn by any Participant during calendar year 2005 subject to such procedures and limitations as imposed by the Committee; (b) Any deferral election for Compensation in effect during 2005 may be cancelled in whole or in part; and (c) With respect to a deferral which relates in whole or in part to services performed on or before December 31, 2005, an election to defer receipt of such Compensation under this Plan may be made on or before March 15, 2005 with respect to amounts that have not been paid or become payable at the time of the election. ARTICLE VII BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 7.1 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. Each Participant shall have the sole right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as his Beneficiary to whom payment under the Plan shall be made in the event of his or her death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of his or her Account. All Beneficiary designations must be made in the manner required by the Committee or the Recordkeeper. Any designation of a Beneficiary in effect under the Plan prior to this amendment and restatement shall continue in full force and effect until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. 7.2 CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant by making a new Beneficiary designation in the manner required by the Committee or the Recordkeeper, which will cancel all Beneficiary designations previously filed. The designation of a Beneficiary may be made or changed at any time without the consent of any other person. 7.3 NO DESIGNATION. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary shall be the Participant's Beneficiary under the terms of the TIP. 14
7.4 EFFECT OF PAYMENT. Payment to a Participant's Beneficiary shall completely discharge the Employer's obligations under the Plan. The Beneficiary shall have no right to change or in any way modify the manner in which the Participant's Account is being paid. ARTICLE VIII ADMINISTRATION 8.1 COMMITTEE. The Deferred Compensation Plan Committee shall be appointed by the Board and consist of up to three members of the Board who are not Participants in the Plan. The Committee shall have complete discretion to (i) supervise the administration and operation of the Plan, (ii) adopt rules and procedures governing the Plan from time to time, (iii) make interpretive rulings with respect to the Plan terms and determine all questions of fact arising with respect to the Plan terms and any Participant and (iv) to adopt and modify from time to time the Administrative Procedures.. 8.2 AGENTS. The Committee may appoint an individual, who may be an employee of the Company, to be the Committee's agent with respect to the day-to-day administration of the Plan. In addition, the Committee may, from time to time, employ other agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company. 8.3 BINDING EFFECT OF DECISIONS. Any decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan shall be final and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan. 8.4 INDEMNIFICATION OF COMMITTEE. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee and their duly appointed agents under Section 8.2 against any and all claims, loss, damage, expense or liability arising from any action or failure to act with respect to the Plan, to the maximum extent permitted by law. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN 9.1 AMENDMENT. The Board or the Committee, acting on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate shall amend the terms of this Plan from time to time to comply with Section 409A. In addition, 15
the Board or the Committee may, on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate, amend, suspend or reinstate any or all of the provisions of the Plan, including, without limitation, reduce or eliminate employer contributions or Participant deferrals under the Plan; provided that any such amendment, suspension or reinstatement which is inconsistent with Section 409A shall be ineffective to the extent inconsistent with Section 409A. No amendment may reduce the value of any Participant's Account at the end of the calendar year prior to the date such amendment is adopted, except to the extent required for conformance with Section 409A. 9.2 TERMINATION. The Board or the Committee, acting on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate, may terminate this Plan at any time and for any reason whatsoever to the extent permitted by Section 409A. If the Plan is terminated under the provisions of this Section 9.2 all vested Accounts shall be distributed in a lump sum to the Participants or in such other manner as is permitted under Section 409A. A termination of the Plan shall not reduce the value of a Participant's Account, as it existed as of the day before the effective date of such termination except to the extent distributed to the Participant or a Beneficiary. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 FUNDING. Participants, their Beneficiaries, and their heirs, successors and assigns, shall have no secured interest or claim in any property or assets of the Employer. The Employer's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Employer to pay money in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has a related so-called `Rabbi Trust' to hold funds to be used in payment of the obligations of Employers under the Plan. In the event of a Change in Control or prior thereto, the Employers shall fund such trust in an amount equal to not less than the total value of the Participants' Accounts under the Plan as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the Change in Control; provided that any funds contained therein shall be liable for the claims of the respective Employer's general creditors as provided therein. 10.2 NONASSIGNABILITY. No right or interest under the Plan of a Participant or his or her Beneficiary (or any person claiming through or under any of them) shall be assignable or transferable in any manner or be subject to alienation, anticipation, sale, pledge, encumbrance or other legal process or in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any such Participant or Beneficiary. If any Participant or Beneficiary shall attempt to or shall transfer, assign, alienate, anticipate, sell, pledge or otherwise encumber his or her benefits hereunder or any part thereof, or if by reason of his or her bankruptcy or other event happening at any time such benefits would devolve upon anyone else or would not be enjoyed by him or her, then the Committee, in its discretion, may terminate his or her interest in any such benefit (including the Deferral Account) to the extent the Committee considers necessary or advisable to prevent or limit the effects of such occurrence. Termination shall be effected by filing a written "termination declaration" with the Clerk of the 16
Company and making reasonable efforts to deliver a copy to the Participant or Beneficiary whose interest is adversely affected (the "terminated participant"). As long as the terminated participant is alive, any benefits affected by the termination shall be retained by the Employer and, in the Committee's sole and absolute judgment, may be paid to or expended for the benefit of the terminated participant, his or her spouse, his or her children or any other person or persons in fact dependent upon him or her in such a manner as the Committee shall deem proper; provided that no such action shall result in any acceleration of the payment of the Participant's Account. Upon the death of the terminated participant, all benefits withheld from him or her and not paid to others in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be disposed of according to the provisions of the Plan that would apply if he or she died prior to the time that all benefits to which he or she was entitled were paid to him or her. 10.3 LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES. If, after a Change in Control, (1) an Eligible Employee initiates or is required to defend against a claim in court concerning the benefits intended to be provided to such Eligible Employee under the Plan (the "Claim"); and (2) the Eligible Employee prevails on the Claim, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs of the litigation. 10.4 CAPTIONS. The captions contained herein are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction hereof. 10.5 GOVERNING LAW. The provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Employee hereby irrevocably submits to and acknowledges and recognizes the jurisdiction of a federal court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to conflict of law provisions, or if jurisdiction is not appropriate in a federal court located in Massachusetts, then a state court within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (which courts, for purposes of this Agreement, are the only courts of competent jurisdiction) over any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter. 10.6 SUCCESSORS. The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Company, its Selected Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns. The term successors as used herein shall include any corporate or other business entity which shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, acquire all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Company or a Selected Affiliate and successors of any such Company or other business entity. 10.7 RIGHT TO CONTINUED SERVICE. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to confer upon any Eligible Employee the right to continue to serve as an Eligible Employee of the Employer or in any other capacity. 17

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ---------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated February 10, 2005

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 10, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE:ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, which ended January 29, 2005. For the first quarter, revenue was $580.5 million, diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.28, and net income totaled $107.4 million, or approximately 19% of sales. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 16, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2005. "Our revenue in the first quarter declined 4% compared to the same period one year ago and 8% compared to the immediately prior quarter," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "The majority of the sequential revenue decline was isolated to semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE) and wireless handset applications. The ATE revenue decline parallels the cyclical decline in the semiconductor industry. In wireless handsets, it appears clear that the rapid growth of the Chinese manufacturers in the first half of 2004 led to excess inventory which customers reduced over the past two quarters." Gross margins for the first quarter were 57.8%, up 70 basis points from the same quarter last year and down 170 basis points from the immediately prior quarter. Adjustments made to factory utilization and the impact of factory shutdowns during the holiday period impacted gross margins in the first quarter. Mr. Fishman explained, "However, these adjustments to factory utilization coupled with reductions in external wafer purchases allowed us to constrain the inventory growth to levels well below what we planned at the beginning of the quarter. "We also constrained spending during the first quarter, reducing operating expenses by 3.3% sequentially. As a result, operating profits for the first quarter remained strong at $124.7 million or 21.5% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Free cash flow for the quarter was $93 million as a result of cash flow from operations of $117 million, or 20% of sales, offset by capital expenditures of $24 million. During the first quarter, we also repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $161 million. The total common stock repurchased under the $500 million program approved by the board in August of 2004 now stands at 8.4 million shares for approximately $298 million. The number of shares repurchased to date under this program represents approximately 2% of shares outstanding." The company also paid dividends of $23 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. "Order patterns improved during the first quarter compared to the prior two quarters. In addition, we believe that the application areas which drove most of our revenue decline in the past two quarters are now at revenue levels that are unlikely to decline further this year. End customer demand improved to slightly above revenue for the first quarter, which was a significant improvement over the prior two quarters. Additionally, order rates increased in January and this momentum has continued into early February. These combined factors support our plan for sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We believe that the first quarter of fiscal 2005 will represent the trough for our quarterly revenue and we are currently planning for second quarter fiscal 2005 revenue to increase sequentially by 2% to 6%. "At these revenue levels, we expect gross margin to decline slightly during the second quarter because factory utilization will remain low as our plan is for inventory to be flat in dollars and down in days compared to the first quarter. Actual gross margins are dependent on the mix of business and utilization rates of our factories, but we expect gross margins to remain strong and above 57% during this cycle. As demand increases and utilization rates of our factories improve, we expect to realize gross margin leverage. "We are also planning for operating expenses to be approximately flat for the second quarter versus the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect diluted EPS to be approximately $0.29 to $0.31 for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Despite the revenue decline of the past two quarters, we continued to invest in new product programs, winning customers across a wide range of applications. Based on a relatively stable global economic climate and forecasts that predict 2005 will be a good year for most economies around the world, we believe our investments in new product development will generate continued revenue and profit growth for ADI as the year unfolds." Mr. Fishman will discuss the first quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 4:30 pm EST.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Increased Revenue and Profits for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005; Board raises cash dividend to $0.10 from $0.06 per share and increases share repurchase program by $500 million. NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 12, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, which ended April 30, 2005. For the second quarter, revenue was $604 million, diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.31, and net income totaled $118 million, or 19% of sales. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock for the second quarter, up from $0.06 in the first quarter. The dividend is payable on June 15, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 27, 2005. The Board also approved a $500 million increase to the company's share repurchase program. "Our second quarter turned out to be a good quarter for ADI. Revenue increased 4% sequentially and diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.31," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Revenue increased sequentially in every geographic region, except China, as customer inventory declines appear to be completed after a six-month correction. Revenue increased sequentially in both the OEM and distributor channels. "Looking at the end markets, the highest growth on a dollar basis came from the industrial end markets, which grew 11% sequentially, driven by growth from our instrumentation and automotive customers and the resumption of growth from some automatic test equipment (ATE) customers. Sales to consumer customers grew 16% sequentially, primarily as a result of increased market share in digital cameras and advanced digital TVs. Computer product revenue was down sequentially. Revenue from communications applications was approximately flat sequentially, as strong gains in wireless infrastructure were offset by continuing weakness in wireless handsets, particularly among customers in China," Mr. Fishman explained. By end market, approximately 41% of second quarter revenue was from industrial applications, which span a broad range of medical, security, automotive, instrumentation, and defense electronics applications, 31% from communications applications, 15% from consumer applications, and 13% from computer applications. According to Mr. Fishman, "Revenue from analog products increased by 6% compared to the immediately prior quarter and totaled 81% of sales. Most noteworthy was 12% sequential revenue growth in converters and 10% sequential revenue growth in amplifiers -- two product areas at the heart of ADI's franchise and where our market share is very high. Sales of other analog products, including power management, declined sequentially. DSP revenue, which was 19% of sales in the second quarter, declined 4% sequentially, as strong sequential growth in general-purpose DSP products was offset primarily by sequential declines in wireless handsets and broadband products. Gross margins for the second quarter were 57.4%, down 40 basis points from the immediately prior quarter as a result of lower factory utilization. "Operating expenses were approximately flat for the second quarter compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the same quarter last year. We kept tight control of expenses, despite absorbing the effect of annual salary increases and higher employee bonus accruals," said Mr. Fishman. "As a result, operating profits for the second quarter increased to approximately $134 million or 22% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Our balance sheet continued to strengthen in the second quarter. Inventories declined sequentially by $5 million. Days cost of sales in inventory was 124 days in the second quarter, down from 132 days in the first quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 48 days compared to 51 days in the immediately prior quarter. "Cash flow from operations totaled $175 million or 29% of sales. In the second quarter, we spent $22 million on capital expenditures and we returned $146 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 3.4 million shares of ADI common stock for $124 million and by paying $22 million in dividends. As a result, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased slightly to $2.62 billion at the end of the second quarter. "For the past three quarters, since we announced the share repurchase program in August of 2004, ADI has generated approximately $474 million of cash flow from operations. We have spent $84 million on capital expenditures and returned $489 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The total number of shares repurchased to date under this program represents approximately 3% of shares outstanding. We are planning for cash flow to remain strong for the foreseeable future. "Orders increased sequentially during the second quarter and were particularly strong in April. Cancellations declined in the second quarter to the lowest levels in the most recent four quarters. At the end of the second quarter, our backlog of products requested for shipment during the third quarter increased by 4% compared to the backlog at the end of first quarter." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a gradual recovery after six months of inventory corrections at many of our customers worldwide. Demand in many of our end markets is good, with particular strength in the consumer market and across the industrial end markets, which represent tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our converter, amplifier, and general-purpose DSP products have resumed growth. Wireless handset and ATE products, which were responsible for a large portion of our sales decline for the past few quarters, appear to be stabilizing. Our lead times are short and we intend to keep them short to minimize order volatility throughout the cycle. "While it is difficult to plan at this stage of the business cycle, based on our opening backlog, our turns order estimates, and assuming normal seasonality, we are planning for third quarter revenue to be flat to up 3% sequentially. "We are planning for third quarter gross margins to improve toward 58%, depending on product mix. We are planning for inventory to remain approximately flat in the third quarter. We are also planning to hold operating expenses in the third quarter relatively flat to the second quarter levels. This should produce diluted EPS in the range of $0.31 to $ 0.33 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005."

Exhibit 99 Analog Devices Provides Preliminary Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2005 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 2, 2005--Analog Devices (NYSE:ADI) today estimated, on a preliminary basis, its revenue for the fiscal third quarter ended July 30, 2005 will be in the range of $580 to $585 million, down approximately 3% to 4% from the immediately prior quarter. This revised revenue estimate is below the guidance of 0% to 3% growth communicated on May 12, 2005, due primarily to an estimated $23 million sequential decline from the second quarter in sales of GSM/GPRS base band chipsets to wireless handset customers in Asia. Wireless handsets represented approximately 10% of revenue in the third quarter. According to Mr. Jerald Fishman, President and CEO, "Although the communications market was generally weak, the revised outlook is primarily related to lower sales of GSM/GPRS chipsets to Asian customers who continue to struggle against increased global competition. As these customers begin to supply more feature-rich phones this fall, we believe that our wireless handset revenue will begin to recover. "Most other application areas performed largely according to our third quarter plan. The industrial end markets grew sequentially with strength in broad-based industrial products offset by declines in automatic test equipment (ATE) and automotive. Revenue from computer and consumer customers also grew in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. "In line with normal seasonal patterns, our analog product revenue was approximately flat in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter, after growing over 6% sequentially in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2005." Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be approximately 58%. Operating expenses are estimated to decline approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter, resulting in an estimated operating profit margin of approximately 22.5%. Based on these estimates, earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles are estimated to be approximately $0.31 for the third quarter, at the low end of the range communicated in May. Inventory is expected to decline on a dollar basis in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Cash flow from operations is estimated to continue to be strong during the third quarter. Commenting on recent demand trends, Mr. Fishman said, "Order rates increased in the third quarter, above second quarter levels, and were very strong in July. As a result, we began the fourth quarter with higher backlog than at the start of the third quarter. We continue to believe that overall, we are in a gradual recovery that began six months ago." Estimated results for the third quarter presented in this release are subject to change based on the finalization of the third quarter results. The final results for the third quarter will be released at the regularly scheduled time of 4:00 pm Eastern time on Thursday, August 11, 2005. Analog Devices will host a conference call today, August 2, 2005, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time to answer analysts' questions regarding today's update.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2005 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 11, 2005--Analog Devices (NYSE:ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue for the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 30, 2005, was $582.4 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.32. Net income increased to $121.4 million or 21% of sales for the third quarter, up 3% from $117.6 million in the second quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock for the third quarter. The dividend is payable on September 14, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 26, 2005. According to Mr. Jerald Fishman, President and CEO, "Revenue declined 3.5% compared to the immediately prior quarter, primarily due to declines in sales of DSP-based products sold to wireless handset customers in Asia. Revenue from analog products was about even with the immediately prior quarter, after growing sequentially by 6% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, analog product revenue totaled 84% of sales. "Gross margins increased to 58.1% for the third quarter, 70 basis points higher than the immediately prior quarter, primarily due to a favorable mix of high margin product sales and the benefit of product cost reductions achieved over recent quarters." "Operating expenses declined approximately 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter. The improvement in gross margins combined with the decline in operating expenses resulted in an operating profit margin of 23.1% of sales, up from 22.2% recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005." Summarizing the third quarter results by end market, Mr. Fishman said, "Sales to medical, defense and industrial instrumentation customers increased in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter, but were offset by declines in sales to automatic test equipment (ATE) and automotive customers. Overall, the industrial markets totaled approximately 41% of sales in the third quarter. The computer market had the strongest sequential growth in the third quarter and was approximately 16% of sales. Our revenue from consumer customers also increased sequentially and represented 16% of sales in the third quarter. The communications market was generally weak due to lower sales of products used in wireless and broadband applications. Communications customers represented approximately 27% of sales in the third quarter." "On a geographic basis, third quarter revenue compared to the second quarter grew in Japan, was approximately flat in North America, and declined in the other regions of the world," explained Mr. Fishman. "As a result, approximately 20% of sales were in Japan, 26% of sales in North America, 22% of sales in Europe, and 32% of sales were in China and the rest of Asia." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Our balance sheet continued to strengthen in the third quarter. Inventories declined sequentially by $5 million and days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 46 days compared to 48 days in the immediately prior quarter. "Cash flow from operations totaled $180 million or 31% of sales. In the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $19 million and dividend payments totaled $37 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased by $167 million to $2.78 billion at the end of the third quarter. "Orders for shipment in the next 13 weeks increased sequentially, with particular strength in July, and were above third quarter revenue levels. Our backlog from both OEM customers and distributors for shipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 grew to $341 million, up 11% from $306 million in the second quarter." Regarding the near term plan, Mr. Fishman said, "We continue to believe that overall, we are in a gradual recovery that began six months ago. Good order trends, higher backlog at the start of the quarter, and the beginning of what is typically a seasonally strong period for consumer-oriented products leads us to plan for sequential revenue growth of 1% to 4%. Depending on the mix of analog and DSP product sales, our gross margins for the fourth quarter are planned to improve modestly and we are planning for operating expenses to be up slightly on a dollar basis. As a result, our plan for the fourth quarter is for EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34."

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated September 14, 2005 issued by Analog Devices, Inc.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): October 18, 2005 Analog Devices, Inc. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Massachusetts 1-7819 04-2348234 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (State or other juris- (Commission (IRS Employer diction of incorporation File Number) Identification No.) One Technology Way, Norwood, MA 02062 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (781) 329-4700 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Former name or former address, if changed since last report) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below): [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities On October 18, 2005, the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. committed to a plan to consolidate its wafer fabrication operations. As a result, ADI plans to close its California wafer fabrication operations and transfer production to facilities located in Massachusetts and Ireland which feature the company's most advanced process technologies. The closure of this facility is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006 and is estimated to result in savings of approximately $45 million per year. The transfer of the wafer fabrication operations will result in approximately $50 million of charges over the course of the next twelve months. Approximately $23 million of these charges are for employee-related costs, of which, approximately $20 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. An additional $22 million will be recorded as a non-cash charge for accelerated depreciation and charged to manufacturing expense during fiscal 2006. The remaining costs, which include clean-up and lease termination costs, will be charged to expense as they are incurred during fiscal 2006. As a result, the company plans to take charges of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, approximately $6 million in each of the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, and approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The company also announced that organizations throughout the company refined their product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on the company's analog and DSP products. These organizational changes will save approximately $16 million per year once fully completed. To accomplish this, the company will record charges of approximately $13 million of primarily severance related costs, most of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Approximately all of these costs will result in future cash expenditures. Most of this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006. Item 8.01. Other Events On October 18, 2005, the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. accelerated the vesting of certain existing "out-of-the-money" stock options that have exercise prices per share of $40.00 or higher and were granted to employees, excluding corporate officers and directors, after December 31, 2000. Options to purchase approximately 18 million shares of ADI stock became exercisable on October 18, 2005 as a result of this acceleration. These options have exercise prices ranging from $40.00 to $59.20 per share and, based on yesterday's closing stock price of $33.19, are significantly "out-of-the-money." The decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce the $188 million of non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in the company's income statement in future periods, as a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R), because this future expense would have been disproportionately high compared to the low economic value of the options. On October 18, 2005, the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. authorized the repatriation of $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, ADI has until October 29, 2005 to repatriate the earnings at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, the company will record an additional estimated tax expense of $49 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.

Other. The Corporation shall reimburse Executive for up to $50,000 of his documented expenses incurred each year for financial, tax and estate planning services. 4. Termination. This Agreement, and Executive's employment hereunder, shall terminate under the following circumstances: 4.1. Death or Disability. This Agreement and the Employment Period shall terminate automatically upon Executive's death. The Corporation may terminate this Agreement, after having established Executive's Disability, by giving to Executive written notice of its intention to terminate Executive's employment. In such a case, Executive's employment with the Corporation shall terminate effective on the 180th day after receipt of such notice (the "Disability Effective Date"), 2
provided that, within 180 days after such receipt, Executive shall not have returned to full performance of Executive's duties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means personal injury, illness or other cause which, after the expiration of not less than 180 days after its commencement, renders Executive unable to perform his duties with substantially the same level of quality as immediately prior to such incident and such disability is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Corporation or its insurers and acceptable to Executive or Executive's legal representative (such agreement as to acceptability not to be withheld unreasonably). 4.2. With or Without Cause. The Corporation may terminate Executive's employment with or without "Cause." The Employment Period shall immediately end upon a termination by the Corporation with Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means (i) the willful and continued failure of Executive to perform substantially his duties with the Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Executive by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive's duties, (ii) the willful engaging by Executive in gross and reckless negligence which materially and adversely affects the Corporation's business; (iii) Executive's willful engaging in conduct that is materially injurious to the Corporation; (iv) Executive's conviction (by a court of competent jurisdiction, not subject to further appeal) of, or pleading guilty to, a felony, or (v) a material breach of any of Executive's obligations not to compete with the Corporation or to maintain the confidentiality of its confidential and proprietary information. For purpose of this Section 4.2, no act or failure to act by Executive shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by Executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duty adopted by the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation. Cause shall not exist unless and until (a) in the event of any Cause defined and clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) above, a written noticed has been provided to the Executive by the Board specifically identifying the Cause that is the basis for the Board's determination and Executive has failed to cure or remedy the action or omission so identified within a period of 30 days after Executive's receipt of such notice (unless the action or omission is of a nature that it cannot be cured or remedied), and (b) the Corporation has delivered to Executive, along with the Notice of Termination for Cause, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board (excluding Executive if Executive is a Board member) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity 3
for Executive, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board an event set forth in clauses (i) to (v) above has occurred and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. If the Board does not notify Executive that any occurrence or event shall constitute "Cause" within sixty (60) days following the Board's first knowledge of such occurrence or event, such occurrence or event shall not constitute Cause under this Agreement. Any events, facts or circumstances known to the Board that have occurred prior to the Effective Date, and any consequences thereof (whether before or after the Effective Date), shall not constitute "Cause" under this Agreement. 4.3. With or Without Good Reason. Executive's employment may be terminated by Executive with or without Good Reason. The Employment Period shall immediately end upon a termination by Executive without Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means: (i) (a) the assignment to Executive of any duties inconsistent in any material respect with his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or any other action by the Corporation that results in a material diminution in his authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied by the Corporation properly after receipt of notice thereof given by Executive to the Board, or (b) a material and adverse change in Executive's titles or offices (including his position as President and Chief Executive Officer) with the Corporation; (ii) any failure by the Corporation to comply in any material respect with any of the provisions of Section 3 of this Agreement; (iii) the Corporation requiring Executive to be based at any office or location more than 50 miles from Norwood, Massachusetts, or requiring Executive to travel in the performance of his duties significantly more extensively than the customary travel requirements of Executive as of the Effective Date; (iv) any purported termination by the Corporation of Executive's employment otherwise than as permitted by this Agreement, it being understood that any such purported termination shall not be effective for any purpose of this Agreement; or (v) any failure by the Corporation to comply with and satisfy Section 8.3 of this Agreement by causing any successor to the Corporation to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement with Executive, to the full extent set forth in said Section 8.3; 4
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination by Executive with Good Reason shall be effective only if, within 30 days following the delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason by Executive to the Corporation, the Corporation has failed to cure the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason to the reasonable satisfaction of Executive. 4.4. Expiration of the Employment Period. This Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the Employment Period. 4.5. Notice of Termination. Any termination by the Corporation with or without Cause or by Executive with or without Good Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 9.6 of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the termination date is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the proposed termination date. 5. Obligations of the Corporation Upon Termination. 5.1. Death. If Executive's employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death, the Corporation shall: a. pay Executive's estate, to the extent not previously paid, Executive's Base Salary, and accrued vacation pay, through the date of termination; and b. provide those death benefits to which Executive is entitled at the date of Executive's death under any death benefit plans, policies or arrangements of the Corporation. 5.2. Disability. If Executive's employment is terminated by reason of Executive's disability, the Corporation shall: a. pay to Executive, to the extent not previously paid, Executive's Base Salary, and accrued vacation pay, through the date of termination; and b. provide those benefits to which Executive is then entitled under any disability plan, policies or arrangements of the Corporation. 5.3. Cause or Without Good Reason. If Executive's employment shall be terminated (i) by the Corporation with Cause, or (ii) by Executive without Good Reason, the Corporation shall pay Executive his Base Salary through the date of termination and any accrued vacation pay, and shall have no further obligations to Executive under this Agreement. 5
5.4. Without Cause or With Good Reason. If Executive's employment shall be terminated (i) by the Corporation without Cause, or (ii) by Executive with Good Reason, the Corporation shall: a. pay to Executive, to the extent not previously paid, Executive's Base Salary, and accrued vacation pay, through the date of termination; b. pay Executive, in a lump sum in cash, within thirty (30) days after the date of termination, an amount equal to (i) his Base Salary at the time of termination plus his Target annual bonus (i.e., the agreed upon percentage of his Base Salary) for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, multiplied by (ii) a number equal to the lesser of (A) three (3) and (B) the number of full years (plus a fraction representing any partial year) remaining in the Employment Period immediately prior to such termination. c. provide to Executive the medical and dental benefits, or payment in lieu of such benefits, available to Executive immediately prior to such termination, for the remainder of the Employment Period (notwithstanding the termination thereof by reason of this Section 5). In addition, upon any termination of Executive's employment during the Employment Period in accordance with this Section 5.4, all then unvested outstanding stock options to purchase common stock of the Corporation held by Executive shall become fully vested and exercisable in full. 6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive (whether cash or equity based, or otherwise) or other plan or program provided by the Corporation or any of its affiliated companies and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any stock option or other agreements with the Corporation. Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Corporation or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the date on which Executive's employment is terminated shall be payable in accordance with such plan or program. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if Executive becomes entitled to payments pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the Executive agrees to waive payments under any severance plan or program of the Corporation. 7. Noncompetition; Nondisclosure; Nonsolicitation. 7.1. Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, during the period of Executive's employment with the Corporation and for two years thereafter (the "Covenant Period"), he shall not, without the prior written consent of the Corporation, engage in Competition (as defined below) with the Corporation. For purposes of this Agreement, if Executive takes any of the following actions he shall be engaged in "Competition": engaging in or carrying on, 6
directly or indirectly, any enterprise, whether as an advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, stockholder, associate or consultant to any person, partnership, corporation or any other business entity, that is principally engaged in any business operating within the United States of America, which is involved in business activities which are the same as, similar to or in competition with the principal business activities carried on by the Corporation, or being definitely planned by the Corporation, at the time of the termination of the Executive's employment; provided,, however, that "Competition" shall not include (i) the passive ownership of securities in any public enterprise and exercise of rights related thereto, so long as such securities represent no more than five percent of the voting power of all securities of such enterprise or (ii) the indirect ownership of securities through ownership of shares in a registered investment company. 7.2. Executive shall not, without the Corporation's prior written consent, disclose or use any non-public confidential information of or relating to the Corporation, whether disclosed to or learned by Executive during the course of his employment or otherwise, so long as such information is not publicly known or available, except for such disclosures as are required by law or in connection with Executive's performance of services to the Corporation hereunder. Executive further agrees that he shall not make any statements at any time that disparage the reputation of the Corporation or any of its affiliates. For purposes of this Section 7, the term "affiliate" of the Corporation means the Board, any and all Committees of the Board (the "Committees") and any and all individual members of either the Board or any of the Committees, in their capacity as such, and any employee or officer of the Corporation. 7.3. Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, during the Covenant Period, he shall not: (A) attempt to influence, persuade or induce, or assist any other person in so influencing, persuading or inducing, (i) any customer of the Corporation to give up, or to not commence, a business relationship with the Corporation and (ii) any employee of the Corporation to cease such employment, or (B) hire, or assist any other person in hiring, any person who voluntarily ceased being an employee of the Company within six months prior to such hiring. 7.4. Executive agrees that all processes, technologies, designs and inventions ("Inventions"), including new contributions, improvements, ideas and discoveries, whether patentable or not, conceived, developed, invented or made by him during the Employment Period shall belong to the Corporation, provided that such Inventions grew out of Executive's work for the Corporation, are related in any manner to the business (commercial or experimental) of the Corporation or are conceived or made on the Corporation's time or with the use of the Corporation's facilities or materials. Executive shall further: (a) promptly disclose such Inventions to the Corporation; (b) assign to the Corporation, without additional compensation, all patent and 7
other rights to such Inventions for the United States and foreign countries; (c) sign all papers necessary to carry out the foregoing; and (d) give testimony in support of the status of Executive as the inventor of such Inventions. Executive agrees mat he will not assert any rights to any Invention as having been made or acquired by him prior to the Effective Date, except for Inventions, if any, disclosed to the Corporation in writing prior to the Effective Date. 7.5. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Corporation for breach of any of his obligations under Section 7 of this Agreement would be inadequate, and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies which the Corporation may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of his violation of any provision of Section 7 of this Agreement, the Corporation shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage. 7.6. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in Section 7 of this Agreement are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If any of such covenants or such other provisions of this Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (i) the remaining terms and provisions hereof shall be unimpaired and (ii) the invalid or unenforceable term or provision shall be deemed replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. 7.7. Executive understands that the provisions of Section 7 of this Agreement may limit his ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Corporation but he nevertheless agrees and hereby acknowledges that (i) such provisions do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interests of the Corporation, (ii) such provisions contain reasonable limitations as to time and scope of activity to be restrained, (iii) such provisions are not harmful to the general public, (iv) such provisions are not unduly burdensome to Executive, and (v) the consideration provided hereunder is sufficient to compensate Executive for the restrictions contained in Section 7 of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing and in light of Executive's education, skills and abilities, Executive agrees that he shall not assert that, and it should not be considered that, any provisions of Section 7 otherwise are void, voidable or unenforceable or should be voided or held unenforceable. 7.8. If Executive violates any of the restrictions contained in Section 7 of this Agreement, the restrictive period shall not run in favor of the Executive from the time of the commencement of 8
any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by the Executive to the satisfaction of the Corporation. 8. Successors. 8.1. This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of the Corporation shall not be assignable by Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's legal representatives. 8.2. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Corporation and its successors. 8.3. The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Corporation" shall mean the Corporation as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise. 9. Miscellaneous. 9.1. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The parties hereto agree that exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute regarding this Agreement shall be the state or federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts. 9.2. In the event of any termination of Executive's employment hereunder, Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment or otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Corporation under this Agreement, and there shall be no offset against amounts due Executive under this Agreement on account of amounts purportedly owing by Executive to the Corporation. Any amounts due to Executive under this Agreement upon termination of employment are considered to be reasonable by the Corporation and are not in the nature of a penalty. 9.3. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. 9.4. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives. 9
9.5. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by facsimile or nationally recognized overnight courier service, addressed as follows: If to Executive: ---------------- Jerald G. Fishman c/o Analog Devices, Inc. One Technology Way Norwood, MA 02062 If to the Corporation: ---------------------- Analog Devices, Inc. One Technology Way Norwood, MA 02062 or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee. 9.6. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 9.7. The Corporation may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. To the extent that any amount subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code is to be paid or provided to Executive in connection with a separation from service at a time when Executive is considered a specified employee within the terms of said Section 409A, then such payment shall not be made until the date (the "Payment Date") that is six months and one day after such separation from service (the "Six Month Period"). All amounts which would have been paid during such Six Month Period will be paid in a lump sum on such Payment Date. 9.8. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Corporation and Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior agreements or commitments relating thereto, including without limitations the letter agreement dated June 21, 2000 between Executive and the Corporation, but excluding the Employee Retention Agreement dated January 16, 1989 (the "Retention Agreement"), which shall remain in full force and effect. 9.9. The Retention Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, subject to the following: (a) in the event of any termination of employment of the Executive following a Change in Control (as defined in the Retention Agreement) that gives rise to any payments under Section 5(c) of the Retention Agreement that are greater than the payments provided for in this Agreement, the 10
provisions of Sections 5(c) and 5(d) of the Retention Agreement shall supercede the provisions of Section 5.4 hereof (other than the last sentence of Section 5.4), and (b) in the event of any termination of employment of the Executive following a Change of Control that gives rise to any payments under Section 5(c) of the Retention Agreement that are less than the payments provided for in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede Section 5(c) of the Retention Agreement and such payments under this Agreement shall be considered "Severance Payments" for purposes of Section 5(d) of the Retention Agreement.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2005; Board of Directors increases dividend to $0.12 per share for the quarter Business Editors/Technology Editors NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $622 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, 7% above the immediately prior quarter and a decrease of 2% compared to the same quarter one year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.18 for the fourth quarter, compared to $0.34 for the same period one year ago and $0.32 for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The fourth quarter results were reduced by $0.18 associated with the previously announced restructuring charges and the repatriation of foreign earnings. The restructuring charge of $31.5 million impacted EPS by $0.05 and the additional tax expense of $49 million impacted EPS by $0.13. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock, compared to $0.10 declared in the previous quarter. The dividend will be paid on December 14, 2005 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2005. Revenue for fiscal year 2005, which ended October 29, 2005, totaled $2.39 billion, a decline of 9% compared to fiscal year 2004. Compared to fiscal 2004 diluted EPS of $1.45, fiscal 2005 diluted EPS was $1.08, which was reduced by $0.18 due to the restructuring charges and the additional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. "The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 turned out to be a very strong quarter for ADI, with revenue growing 7% sequentially, well above the level planned for the quarter," said Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO of Analog Devices, Inc. "Our strongest sequential revenue growth came from the communications market, and in particular, from cellular telephones and from networking applications. In the fourth quarter, communications applications grew approximately 18% compared to the immediately prior quarter and represented 30% of sales. "We also enjoyed continuing strength from sales to consumer customers in applications areas such as digital cameras and advanced televisions, both areas where we are well-positioned with the market share leaders. In the fourth quarter, 16% of sales were to consumer customers and revenue from this end market grew 10% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2005. "Revenue from computer customers increased by 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. Computer customers represented approximately 15% of sales in the fourth quarter. "Revenue from our broad base of industrial customers, representing factory automation, medical instrumentation, defense and security systems, as well as automotive electronics, was approximately flat for the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter and totaled approximately 39% of sales." In the fourth quarter, analog product revenue increased 3% from the immediately prior quarter, increased 1% compared to the same period one year ago, and represented 81% of total sales. For the fiscal year 2005, revenue from analog products declined 7% year-over-year, after growing 31% in fiscal year 2004 and 16% in fiscal year 2003. Converter products, ADI's largest analog product category, represented 44% of total ADI sales in the fourth quarter as revenue increased 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter and 9% compared to the same period one year ago. For the fiscal year 2005, revenue from converter products was slightly lower than the previous year, after growing 31% in fiscal year 2004 and 25% in fiscal year 2003. DSP product revenue for the fourth quarter increased 26% from the immediately prior quarter, declined 11% compared to the same period one year ago, and represented 19% of sales. Revenue from general-purpose DSP products, which are included in DSP product revenue, represented approximately 7% of total ADI sales in the fourth quarter. General-purpose DSP product revenue, which is derived from a broad base of customers across many diverse applications, grew 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter and 13% compared to the same period one year ago. For fiscal year 2005, revenue from all DSP products declined 18% year-over-year, after growing 21% in fiscal year 2004 and 35% in fiscal year 2003. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 58.3%, compared to 58.1% in the immediately prior quarter. Operating profits for the fourth quarter totaled $123 million or approximately 20% of sales, after including $31.5 million of restructuring-related expense, which is equivalent to approximately 5% of sales. "Cash flow was very strong in the fourth quarter, with cash flow from operations totaling $200 million or approximately 32% of sales," said Mr. Fishman. "During the quarter, we spent $21 million on capital expenditures and we returned $278 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 6.7 million shares of ADI common stock for $241 million and by paying $37 million in cash dividends." In the fourth quarter, inventory declined sequentially by approximately $20 million, resulting in days cost of sales in inventory declining to 115 days. Accounts receivable balances remained under good control. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days for the fourth quarter. According to Mr. Fishman, "Orders were strong in the fourth quarter in every region of the world with the exception of Europe where orders declined sequentially. Turns orders (orders booked and shipped during the quarter) remained high and comprised approximately 50% of sales for the fourth quarter. Inventory levels declined in distribution. This is all consistent with our continuing short lead times and the high turns environment in which we are still operating." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "As we enter 2006, we are planning for a good year. Our 13-week backlog at the beginning of the first quarter is 4% higher than last quarter. Due to the normal seasonality in the consumer and industrial markets, we are planning for first quarter revenue to be approximately equal to fourth quarter levels and for first quarter EPS to be approximately $0.31, which is reduced by approximately $0.05 of previously announced restructuring-related expense and stock-based compensation expense. The planned $7.7 million of restructuring-related expense is estimated to impact EPS by $0.01 and the estimated $20 million of stock-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by $0.04." ADI will begin expensing stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2006. The company has provided a table at http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=95455&p=irol-irHome which includes estimates of the impact of stock-based compensation and the impact of previously announced restructuring-related expenses on the company's 2006 quarterly financial statements. Regarding the balance of fiscal year 2006, Mr. Fishman said, "We are planning for sequential revenue growth to resume in the second quarter and for gross margins to continue to improve throughout the year as we increase the utilization of our internal wafer fabs. We intend to keep expenses tightly constrained, with most increases tied directly to improving financial performance. In aggregate, we are planning to hold the rate of expense growth well below the rate of sales growth and thereby continue to increase operating profits by a high percentage of the planned sales growth. We believe that throughout 2006 the breadth of our high performance analog and DSP technology and the diversity of applications where this technology helps differentiate our customers' end systems will continue to produce excellent results for our shareholders."

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): January 23, 2006 Analog Devices, Inc. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Massachusetts 1-7819 04-2348234 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (State or other juris- (Commission (IRS Employer diction of incorporation File Number) Identification No.) One Technology Way, Norwood, MA 02062 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (781) 329-4700 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Former name or former address, if changed since last report) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below): [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On January 24, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of an Executive Performance Bonus Plan for fiscal year 2006 (the "Executive Bonus Plan"). All Named Executive Officers and other senior management approved by the Compensation Committee will participate in the Executive Bonus Plan. The payments under the Executive Bonus Plan are calculated based on the following factors: 1. Eligible Earnings - base pay during the bonus period. 2. Operating Profit Before Tax as a Percentage of Revenue for the Bonus Period - this can be adjusted by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion based on special items including but not limited to: stock option expense; asset write-downs; litigation; claim judgments; settlements; changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; and any extraordinary non-recurring items. The Bonus Payout Factor ranges from zero to three. 3. Individual's Bonus Target Percentage of Salary - this is a percentage of an individual's Eligible Earnings. The Individual's Bonus Target Percentage of Salary for our executive officers is determined individually for each executive officer by the Compensation Committee. They currently range from 25% to 120%. The bonus calculated by multiplying items one through three above is then subject to the following potential adjustments numbered four through six: 4. Evaluation of Individual's Performance - this can reduce, but not increase, the bonus calculated through item number three above by as much as 50% based on an evaluation of the executive's individual performance. This evaluation will be performed by the CEO for all of our executive officers, except for the CEO's evaluation, which will be performed by the Compensation Committee. 5. Performance of the Company Relative to Competitors - this can increase the bonus calculated through item number four by 25% based on the Company's sales growth during the bonus period relative to the sales growth of a group of peer companies selected by the Compensation Committee. 6. Analog's EPS Relative to the Plan for the Year - this can increase the bonus calculated through item number four by 25% if Analog's annual fiscal year 2006 diluted EPS is equal to or exceeds the plan established at the beginning of the year. For purposes of the Executive Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee can, at its sole discretion, adjust diluted EPS to exclude certain items including but not limited to: stock option expense; asset write-downs; litigation; claim judgments; settlements; changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; and any extraordinary non-recurring items. Distributions, if any, under the Executive Bonus Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and paid out in approximately June 2006 and December 2006 based on local payroll cycles. Item numbers four, five and six are only assessed and/or calculated annually at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, the bonus paid in June 2006 will be calculated by multiplying the first three items. Any adjustment for numbers four, five and six will be assessed and calculated after the fiscal year end and applied to the December bonus payment.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement The information set forth in Item 3.03 is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.03. Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders On January 23, 2006, in accordance with the provisions of Section 23 of the Rights Agreement dated as of March 18, 1998, as amended, between the Company and BankBoston N.A. (or its successor) as Rights Agent (as amended, the "Rights Agreement"), the Board of Directors of the Company ordered the redemption by the Company of all of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) outstanding under the Rights Agreement at a redemption price of $0.0005 per Right (as adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of the Company's common stock on March 15, 2000) (as adjusted, the "Redemption Price") payable on March 15, 2006 to the holders of record of the Company's common stock as of February 24, 2006. All rights to exercise Rights terminated on January 23, 2006 and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights is to receive the Redemption Price.

(NYSE: ADI): -- Board of Directors declares dividend of $0.12 per share for the quarter. -- Financial results for the first quarter and guidance for the second quarter to be discussed on conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $621.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of 7% compared to the same period one year ago and approximately even with the immediately prior quarter's $622.1 million in revenue. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $120.6 million for the first quarter, compared to $107.4 million in the same period one year ago and $68.3 million in the immediately prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.32 for the first quarter, compared to $0.28 for the same period one year ago and $0.18 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 include expenses of $6.9 million associated with the previously announced restructuring actions and $20.6 million of stock option expense which together impacted diluted EPS by $0.05. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2006. Gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $360.8 million or 58.1% of sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, gross margins were reduced by $6.9 million, or 1.1% of sales, related to stock option expense and previously announced manufacturing restructuring-related expense. Operating profits for the first quarter totaled $132.2 million, or approximately 21.3% of sales, which includes $27.5 million, or 4.4% of sales, for stock option expense and previously announced restructuring-related expense. Cash flow from operations totaled $175.3 million, or approximately 28.2% of sales for the first quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $20.4 million. The company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of ADI common stock for $125.1 million and paid $44.1 million in cash dividends. In the first quarter, inventory increased sequentially by approximately $12 million, $2 million of which was related to stock option expense. The remaining increase in inventory was primarily due to the purchase of wafers from external foundries. During the quarter, ADI's factory utilization levels were approximately the same as the prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 118 days for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 132 days for the same period one year ago and 115 days for the immediately prior quarter. Accounts receivable balances remained low, consistent with prior quarters. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days for the first quarter, compared to 51 days for the same period one year ago and 47 days for the immediately prior quarter. "The first quarter results were in line with our plan for the quarter, although gross margins were somewhat stronger than planned," said Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO of Analog Devices, Inc. "Our highest sequential growth came from sales to communications and industrial customers. In line with normal seasonal trends, sales to consumer and computer customers were down sequentially. "Revenue from industrial customers grew 16% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period last year. These customers represent a diverse collection of instrumentation, medical, factory process control, test equipment, automotive, and defense applications. We believe that this growth reflects generally good worldwide economic conditions which are stimulating higher capital spending at industrial companies with strong cash flow. In the aggregate, sales to this broad group of industrial customers represented 41% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. "Revenue from consumer customers represented 15% of sales during the first quarter and grew 18% year-over-year, fueled by a broad array of audio and video products sold to leading consumer customers around the world. ADI is well positioned in digital cameras, flat screen televisions and monitors, as well as a range of stereo and home theatre sound systems. "In the first quarter of 2006, revenue from computer customers represented 13% of sales and declined year-over-year. The computer market has lagged for ADI as we continue to address the market for portable products but still have an installed base of slower growing desktop products. Clearly computer products and the power management products, in particular, which account for a high percentage of our sales to computer customers, represent growth opportunities for ADI going forward. "Overall, revenue from communications customers, which represented 31% of sales, grew slightly compared to the first quarter one year ago. Growth in sales of products used in infrastructure equipment for wireless, broadband, and optical networking was partially offset by a decline in sales to wireless handset customers. "In the first quarter, analog product revenue was 11% above the same period one year ago, 2% above the immediately prior quarter, and represented 82% of total sales. Revenue from general-purpose DSP products, which represented approximately 7% of ADI's total revenue, grew 19% year-over-year. In aggregate, DSP product revenue represented 18% of first quarter sales, declined 9% compared to the same period one year ago and declined 8% from the immediately prior quarter." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Orders were strong in the first quarter, particularly for our analog products. As a result, we are planning for 5% to 6% sequential sales growth in our analog products, driven by good seasonal strength from industrial, consumer, and communications customers. This will be somewhat offset by a sequential decline in sales of DSP products, primarily as a result of our divestiture of the DSP-based DSL (digital subscriber line) ASIC and network processor products, which represented approximately $12 million of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. As a result, we are planning for second quarter revenue in the range of $635 to $650 million. "We are also planning for gross margins to continue to improve during the second quarter. Our plan is for operating margins to improve sequentially and for diluted EPS to be $0.34-$0.36, which includes approximately $0.05 of previously announced restructuring-related expense and stock option expense. "We are also expecting the previously announced sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor products to close in the near future, and are anticipating the recognition of a small gain on the sale during the second quarter. This gain is not included in the diluted EPS estimate mentioned above." ADI began expensing stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2006.

The Plan had been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") on January 23, 2006, subject to shareholder approval, and provides for the grant of up to 15,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, plus such number of additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "1998 Plan") and the 2001 Broad-based Stock Option Plan (the "2001 Plan") as of January 23, 2006 that are subsequently terminated or expire without being exercised. The Company will not grant further options under the 1998 Plan or the 2001 Plan.

The Plan is administered by the Board, which also has authority to interpret the terms of the Plan. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board authority to administer certain aspects of the Plan, including the granting of options to executive officers.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Results for Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) -- Board of Directors increases quarterly dividend to $0.16 from $0.12 per share; -- Financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 will be discussed via conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc.

Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $145.8 million for the second quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39 for the second quarter. The GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 include the following items: a gain of $13 million related to the previously-announced sale of the digital signal processing (DSP)-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network processor product line; expenses of $6 million included in cost of sales and related to previously-announced restructuring actions; and $17 million of non-cash stock option expense. These items reduced diluted EPS by $0.02 in the second quarter. The cash dividend was increased to $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 14, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2006. This is an increase from the $0.12 dividend paid in March of 2006. "The second quarter was a good quarter for ADI, led by strong growth in sales to our industrial instrumentation, consumer electronics, and wireless infrastructure customers," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Data converter, amplifier, and general-purpose DSP products were the fastest-growing product categories compared to the immediately prior quarter." Profit Margins Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $380.7 million, or 59.1% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, gross margin was reduced by $6.9 million, or 1.1% of sales, as a result of stock option expense and previously announced manufacturing restructuring-related expense. Operating profits for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $151.4 million, or approximately 23.5% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, operating profits were reduced by $22.8 million, as a result of stock option expense and previously announced restructuring-related expense. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Cash flow from operations totaled $205.1 million, or approximately 32% of sales, for the second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $28.8 million. The company repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares of ADI common stock for $237.7 million and paid $44.2 million in cash dividends. Cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In the second quarter, inventory increased by approximately $21.6 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 125 days at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 124 days one year ago and 118 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. The company increased inventory in preparation for the planned to shutdown of its California wafer fabrication facility and to fulfill planned sales growth for the third quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable were 51 days at the end of the second quarter, compared to 49 days one year ago and 47 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a disproportionate amount of shipments in the last month of the quarter as supply issues earlier in the quarter were resolved. Revenue Analysis By Product During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, analog products totaled 84% of sales and DSP products totaled 16% of sales. Revenue from analog products grew 11% compared to the same period one year ago and 5% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Data converter product sales grew 8%, amplifier sales grew 9%, and other analog product sales declined 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue from each of these analog product categories increased on a year-over-year basis. Revenue from DSP products declined 10% compared to the same period one year ago and 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter due primarily to the previously announced sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. General-purpose DSP product sales grew 6% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue Analysis By End Market Revenue from both the industrial and consumer end markets grew sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue from the industrial end market, which includes factory automation, scientific and medical instrumentation, semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), defense electronics, and automotive applications, totaled approximately 42% of sales in the second quarter. Revenue from the consumer end market totaled approximately 17% of sales in the second quarter. Within the communications end market, revenue from wireless infrastructure customers grew significantly compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue from wireless handset customers also grew while revenue from networking customers declined, as expected, due to the previously announced sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Overall, revenue from the communications end markets totaled approximately 29% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. In line with the broader computer industry trends, revenue from customers in the computer end market declined during the quarter and was approximately 12% of sales. Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2006 Regarding the near term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Orders and backlog increased significantly during the second quarter. Our OEM customers and our distributors are signaling significant increases in demand for our analog and DSP products. In aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the range of $675 million to $685 million." ADI is planning for gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately the same as the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Operating expenses are planned to increase a few percent compared to the second quarter, primarily due to increased profit sharing and commissions as sales and operating margin expand. Diluted EPS is planned to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which includes approximately $0.06 for stock option expenses, previously-announced restructuring expenses, and expenses associated with a previously-announced acquisition. The plan for third quarter is for days sales in accounts receivable to decline to approximately 48 days. Days cost of sales in inventory is planned to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Supplemental Information In order to help investors compare current results to ADI's history and thereby better understand the underlying trends in the company's business, ADI has provided a table of supplemental information with this release, and on its website, which includes estimates of the impact of stock option expense, the impact of previously announced restructuring-related expenses, the impact of the gain from the sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line, and the impact of expenses associated with a previously announced acquisition on the company's 2006 quarterly financial statements.

Item 8.01. Other Events On May 24, 2006, Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that it has received a document subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to the Company's granting of stock options. The Company plans to cooperate fully with the office of the United States Attorney in connection with this subpoena. The Company believes that the options at issue in this matter are the same option grants which have been the subject of investigation by the SEC. As previously disclosed, the Company has reached a tentative settlement with the SEC regarding the SEC's inquiry into the Company's stock option granting practices. The Company is continuing to work with the SEC to finalize that settlement. The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement dates for the options in question are not material to any of the Company's fiscal years, based on the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Receives Subpoena NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 24, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) announced that it has received a document subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to the Company's granting of stock options. The Company plans to cooperate fully with the office of the United States Attorney in connection with this subpoena. The Company believes that the options at issue in this matter are the same option grants which have been the subject of investigation by the SEC. As previously disclosed, the Company has reached a tentative settlement with the SEC regarding the SEC's inquiry into the Company's stock option granting practices. That settlement would conclude that, with respect to options granted to Company employees (including officers) and directors on November 10, 2000, the Company should have made disclosures in its proxy filings to the effect that the Company priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results. Further, with respect to options granted to employees (including officers) and directors in 2001, the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for options granted on July 18, 2001 should have been July 26, 2001 (which is five trading days after the original date). The Company is continuing to work with the SEC to finalize that settlement. The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement dates for the options in question are not material to any of the Company's fiscal years, based on the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99.

Item 8.01. Other Events On June 7, 2006, Analog Devices, Inc. ("ADI" or the "Company") entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. ("Integrant") of Seoul, Korea. Integrant is an innovator in the field of high-performance analog circuits designed for reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) signal processing, and is the leading supplier of low-power radio tuners that allow mobile communications, computer, and consumer devices to receive digital television (TV) and digital radio broadcasts. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Company expects to pay approximately $127 million in cash at the closing in exchange for substantially all of the outstanding shares of Integrant. A portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of Integrant will be placed into escrow to secure potential indemnification claims under the stock purchase agreement and to facilitate the acquisition of the remaining shares not acquired at closing. The Company may pay up to an additional $33 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the acquisition, which is expected to close within approximately 60 days, following the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, the Company will record a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development expenses. The amount of that charge has not yet been determined. Founded in 2000, Integrant has an established revenue base and gross margins consistent with highly-differentiated, low-power RF technology. The acquisition is expected to increase ADI's revenue by approximately 1% of sales in each of the next few quarters. Integrant is best known for the low-power Digital Multimedia Broadcast (DMB) tuners it supplies to Korea's leading mobile phone manufacturers. Integrant's highly innovative designs have resulted in over 100 patents and patent applications worldwide, including extensive intellectual property related to the direct conversion of RF signals to baseband frequencies, an area where ADI has also amassed considerable intellectual property for analog and digital signal processing. Following the closing of the acquisition, the Integrant organization will operate as a product line within ADI's high-speed signal processing organization, whose innovations in RF design focus on receivers and transceivers for broadband wireless, satellite radio and terrestrial and cable TV. This filing contains forward-looking statements, which address a variety of subjects including, for example, the expected closing of the transaction between ADI and Integrant, the expected benefits of the transaction, and ADI's expected product development and technical advances resulting from the transaction.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices to Acquire RF Innovator, Integrant Technologies; ADI to Continue Expansion of Its RF Signal Processing Portfolio with Acquisition of the Leader in Low-Power Mobile TV Tuner Technology. NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 7, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. An innovator in the field of high-performance analog circuits designed for reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) signal processing, Integrant is the leading supplier of low-power radio tuners that allow mobile communications, computer, and consumer devices to receive digital television (TV) and digital radio broadcasts. Founded in 2000, Integrant has an established revenue base and gross margins consistent with highly-differentiated, low-power RF technology. The acquisition is expected to increase ADI's revenue by approximately 1% of sales in each of the next few quarters. The Integrant organization will team with ADI's high-speed signal processing organization, whose innovations in RF design focus on receivers and transceivers for broadband wireless, satellite radio and terrestrial and cable TV. According to John Hussey, ADI vice president for High-Speed Signal Processing, "As we've seen in applications from cellular telephony to digital TVs, customers value RF solution providers that support multiple standards and frequencies with compatible families of products. Integrant's technology provides that same value to the rapidly emerging mobile TV markets, such as T-DMB, ISDB-T and DVB-H, where receivers are being integrated into mobile phones, personal video players, portable DVD players, notebook PCs, and automotive entertainment systems." Integrant is best known for the low-power Digital Multimedia Broadcast (DMB) tuners it supplies to Korea's leading mobile phone manufacturers. Korea leads the world in the deployment of mobile TV services. In addition, Integrant ships tuners from the same product family to support the new ISDB-T mobile TV standard in Japan. Integrant's highly innovative designs have resulted in over 100 patents and patent applications worldwide, including extensive intellectual property related to the direct conversion of RF signals to baseband frequencies, an area where ADI has also amassed considerable intellectual property for analog and digital signal processing. "The synergies between ADI and Integrant are powerful," said Integrant company founder, Beom-Kyu (Brian) Ko. "Together we will have the technology and systems expertise to provide customers with a complete signal chain for multi-standard multimedia applications." Under the terms of the definitive stock purchase agreement, ADI expects to pay approximately $127 million in cash at the closing in exchange for substantially all of the outstanding shares of Integrant. A portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of Integrant will be placed into escrow to secure potential indemnification claims under the acquisition agreement and to facilitate the acquisition of the remaining shares not acquired at closing. ADI may pay up to an additional $33 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the acquisition, which is expected to close within approximately 60 days, following the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, ADI will record a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development expenses. The amount of that charge has not yet been determined. About Analog Devices Innovation, performance, and excellence are the cultural pillars on which Analog Devices has built one of the most long-standing, high-growth companies within the technology sector.

EXHIBIT 99.3 ANALOG DEVICES, INC. Standard Terms and Conditions Relating to Restricted Stock Granted Under 2006 Stock Incentive Plan --------------------------------------- 1. Restricted Stock Grant. Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), hereby grants to the person named on the Confirmation of Restricted Stock Grant (the "Participant") to which these Standard Terms and Conditions are appended (the "Confirmation") that number of shares of common stock, $0.16 2/3 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock"), specified on the Confirmation (the "Shares") without the payment of any cash by the Participant. The Company shall issue to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein (these "Standard Terms" and, together with the Confirmation, this "Agreement") and in the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Shares as of the date set forth on the Confirmation (the "Grant Date"). The Shares will be held in book entry by the Company's transfer agent in the name of the Participant for that number of Shares issued to the Participant. The Participant agrees that the Shares shall be subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in Section 2 of these Standard Terms, the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 of these Standard Terms and the right of the Company to retain Shares pursuant to Section 7 of these Standard Terms. 2. Vesting. (a) Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, the Shares shall vest and become free from the forfeiture provisions in Section 2(b) hereof and become free from the transfer restrictions in Section 3 hereof in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Confirmation. For purposes of this Agreement, Shares that have not vested as of any particular time in accordance with this Section 2(a), are referred to as "Unvested Shares." (b) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or disability, each as provided below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested Shares as of the date of termination shall be forfeited immediately and automatically to the Company without any payment by the Company and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested Shares. (c) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested Shares shall vest in full as of the date of his or her death. (d) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates due to disability (as determined by the Company), the Unvested Shares as of the date of his or her disability shall continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule as if the Participant continued to be employed by the Company. (e) For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company.
3. Restrictions on Transfer; Restrictive Legends. (a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any Shares, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, until such Shares have vested. (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Shares which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to pay dividends to any transferee to whom such Shares have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein. (c) All Unvested Shares shall bear the following restriction, in addition to any other legends that may be required under federal or state securities laws: "The shares of stock represented by this certificate are subject to forfeiture provisions and restrictions on transfer set forth in a certain Confirmation of Restricted Stock Grant, including the related Standard Terms and Conditions, between the corporation and the registered owner of these shares (or his predecessor in interest), and such document is available for inspection without charge at the office of the Secretary of the corporation." 4. Waiver of Cash Dividends. The Participant hereby irrevocably waives all rights and interests in and to any and all cash dividends declared by the Company with respect to any Shares that are Unvested Shares as of the record date applicable to such cash dividend and shall have no right to receive any such declared dividends even if and when such Unvested Shares vest. 5. Provisions of the Plan. The Shares, including the grant and issuance thereof, are subject to the provisions of the Plan. A copy of the Plan prospectus and brochure describing the principal features of the Plan is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column). 6. Consideration. The Shares granted hereby are in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company. 7. Withholding Taxes; Section 83(b) Election. (a) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of the Shares to the Participant or the lapse of the forfeiture provisions. The Participant hereby authorizes and instructs the Company to retain that number of fully vested whole Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of the event creating such withholding obligation (which shall equal the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on such date or, if such date is not a trading date, on the next following trading date) as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to -2-
satisfy such tax obligations. In the event the withholding tax obligation would result in a fractional number of shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole shares. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision. Under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7(a) above, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its discretion, require that the Participant pay to the Company on or prior to the date of the event creating such withholding obligation an amount in cash adequate to satisfy the Company's withholding obligations described in Section 7(a) above instead of through the Company's retention of Shares in the manner provided in Section 7(a) above. Alternatively, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its discretion, elect to sell any such retained Shares for the account of the Participant in order to generate net proceeds that are sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding obligations and such proceeds shall be retained by the Company for such purposes. In the event of such election, the Participant hereby authorizes and instructs the Company, or its designee, to effect such sales for his account. (c) The Participant has reviewed with the Participant's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and other tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated herein. The Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated herein. 8. Miscellaneous. (a) No Rights to Employment. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the Shares pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the Shares hereunder).

EXHIBIT 99.4 FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT CONFIRMING MEMORANDUM GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT Private & Confidential (Addressee Only) Name: Division: Location: We are pleased to advise you that Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), has granted to you Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") on the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Award"). This Award reflects the Company's confidence in your commitment and contributions to the success and continued growth of the Company. 1. Restricted Stock Unit Award. This memorandum confirms that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Analog Devices, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company has granted to you (the "Participant"), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below, that number of RSUs set forth below: Date of Grant: xx/xx/xx Number of RSUs: x,xxx Vesting Schedule: Each one (1) RSU shall, if and when it vests in accordance with this Award, automatically convert into one (1) share of common stock, $0.16 2/3 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock") issuable as provided below. The RSUs are subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 2, the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 and the right of the Company to retain Shares (as defined below) pursuant to Section 7. 2. Vesting and Conversion. (a) Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Award, the RSUs shall vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 1. For purposes of this Award, RSUs that have not vested as of any particular time in accordance with this Section 2(a), are referred to as "Unvested RSUs." The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon the vesting and conversion of the RSUs are referred to in this Award as "Shares". As soon as administratively practicable after the issuance of any Shares upon the vesting and conversion of RSUs, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered evidence (which may include a book entry by the Company's transfer agent) of the Shares so issued in the name of the Participant to the brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain the brokerage account established for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to or in the name of the Participant upon the vesting and conversion of any RSUs unless the issuance of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
(b) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or disability, each as provided below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested RSUs as of the date of termination shall terminate and be cancelled immediately and automatically and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested RSUs. (c) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested RSUs shall vest in full as of the date of his or her death. (d) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates due to disability (as determined by the Company), the Unvested RSUs as of the date of his or her disability shall continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule as if the Participant continued to be employed by the Company. (e) For purposes of this Award, employment with the Company shall include employment with any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company or any such parent or subsidiary of the Company. 3. Restrictions on Transfer. (a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any RSUs, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein. 4. Not a Shareholder. The RSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares upon vesting and conversion of the RSUs, and until vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Participant shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall have no right to receive any dividends with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs for which the record date is on or before the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are issued to the Participant. 5. Provisions of the Plan. The RSUs and Shares, including the grant and issuance thereof, are subject to the provisions of the Plan. A copy of the Plan prospectus and brochure describing the principal features of the Plan is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column). 2
6. Consideration. Any Shares that are issued and any cash payment that is delivered, in either case upon settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award, will be in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient. 7. Withholding Taxes. (a) The Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind (including payroll and social security taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to the award of the RSUs to the Participant, the vesting of the RSUs or the issuance of the Shares. Upon the vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Company may retain that number of whole Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of the event creating such withholding obligation (which shall equal the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on such date or, if such date is not a trading date, on the next following trading date) as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy such tax obligations. In the event the withholding tax obligation would result in a fractional number of shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole shares. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision. Under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7(a) above, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its discretion, require that the Participant pay to the Company on or prior to the date of the event creating such withholding obligation an amount in cash adequate to satisfy the Company's withholding obligations described in Section 7(a) above instead of through the Company's retention of Shares in the manner provided in Section 7(a) above. Alternatively, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its discretion, elect to sell any such retained Shares for the account of the Participant in order to generate net proceeds that are sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding obligations and such proceeds shall be retained by the Company for such purposes. In the event of such election, the Company, or its designee, is authorized to effect such sales for the Participant's account. (c) The Participant is urged to review with the Participant's own legal and tax advisors the federal, state, local and other tax consequences of this grant and the transactions contemplated herein. The Participant should rely solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this grant or the transactions contemplated herein. 3
8. Option of Company to Deliver Cash. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company. 9. Miscellaneous. (a) No Rights to Employment. The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the RSUs hereunder). The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or otherwise for the vesting period, for any period, or at all. (b) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Award shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Award, and each other provision of this Award shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. (c) Waiver. Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Award may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. (d) Binding Effect. This Award shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 of this Award. (e) Notice. Each notice relating to this Award shall be in writing (which shall include electronic form) and delivered in person, electronically or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address as hereinafter provided. Each notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date it is received. Each notice to the Company shall be addressed to it at its offices at Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts, 02062, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. Each notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the Participant's last known mailing or email address, as applicable, on the records of the Company. (f) Pronouns.

(g) Entire Agreement. This Award and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of these documents. 4
(h) Governing Law. This Award shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws. (i) Interpretation. The interpretation and construction of any terms or conditions of this Award or the Plan, or other matters related to the Plan, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be final and conclusive. (j) Participant's Acceptance. The Participant is urged to read this Award carefully and to consult with his or her own legal counsel regarding the terms and consequences of this Award and the legal and binding effect of this Award. By virtue of his or her acceptance of this Award, the Participant is deemed to have accepted and agreed to all of the terms and conditions of this Award and the provisions of the Plan. (k) Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any non-cash distribution to holders of Common Stock, the number of RSUs, and Shares issuable upon vesting and conversion thereof shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. (l) Amendment. This Award may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Participant. /s/ Ray Stata /s/ Jerald Fishman - --------------------- ------------------ Ray Stata Jerald Fishman Chairman of the Board President & CEO 5

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Revises Revenue Outlook for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) announced today that it estimates revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, ending October 28, 2006, will be approximately $640 to $645 million, which is approximately 3% below the third quarter of fiscal 2006 revenue of $663.7 million. The Company's previous outlook for fourth quarter revenue was announced on August 10, 2006, and at that time, ADI estimated fourth quarter revenue would be approximately flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The sequential decline in revenue for the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, is primarily due to a decline in revenue from cellular handset customers. ADI believes that during the fourth quarter these customers depleted inventory they had accumulated during the immediately prior quarter. ADI expects revenue from customers in all other end markets in the aggregate will be up slightly in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, as a result of growth in sales to the broad base of high-performance analog and general-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) customers. ADI's fourth quarter financial release and conference call are scheduled for Tuesday, November 14, 2006, at which time management will discuss results in more detail and provide the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. About Analog Devices Innovation, performance, and excellence are the cultural pillars on which Analog Devices has built one of the longest standing, highest growth companies within the technology sector. Acknowledged industry-wide as the world leader in data conversion and signal conditioning technology, Analog Devices serves over 60,000 customers, representing virtually all types of electronic equipment.

Analog Devices' common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "ADI" and is included in the S&P 500 Index.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 Financial Results NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI): -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share; -- Financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $644.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which ended October 28, 2006, an increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period one year ago and a decrease of approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, revenue was $2.57 billion, an increase of approximately 8% compared to fiscal 2005. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $138.4 million for the fourth quarter, or 21.5% of sales, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39. For fiscal year 2006, GAAP net income was $549.5 million, or 21.4% of sales, and diluted EPS was $1.48. Non-GAAP net income was $139.4 million for the fourth quarter, or 21.6% of sales, and diluted EPS was $0.39. For fiscal year 2006, non-GAAP net income was $591.3 million, or 23% of sales, and diluted EPS was $1.59. The non-GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 exclude the following items: $17.3 million of non-cash stock option expenses associated with the adoption of FAS123R; expenses of $3.6 million related to restructuring actions; expenses of $19.1 million related to previously-announced acquisitions; and $26.7 million of tax benefits which resulted from the completion of a tax examination. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 13, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 24, 2006. "Revenue from consumer customers grew 13% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This revenue growth was driven by strong sales of digital cameras, home entertainment systems, and new video game consoles where ADI technology continues to enable new sight, sound, and other user experiences in our customers' products," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Revenue from computer customers also increased sequentially during the quarter, while revenue from our broad base of industrial customers was approximately flat sequentially. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, revenue from communications customers declined 18% compared to the immediately prior quarter, primarily as a result of lower revenue from wireless handset customers." "For fiscal year 2006, analog product revenue climbed to over $2 billion primarily due to strong growth in converters and amplifiers. Overall, in fiscal 2006, our analog product sales grew 13% year-to-year," said Mr. Fishman. "While revenue from general-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) products grew 10% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, this increase was offset by declines in revenue from application-specific DSP products." Profit Margins Under GAAP, gross margin was $374.6 million, or 58.1% of sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and $1.51 billion, or 58.5% of sales, for fiscal year 2006. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was $382.5 million, or 59.4% of sales, compared to 58.3% of sales in the same period one year ago and 60.1% of sales in the immediately prior quarter. For fiscal year 2006, non-GAAP gross margin was $1.54 billion, or 59.7% of sales, compared to 57.9% of sales in fiscal 2005. The increase from year to year was primarily related to increased factory utilization and the result of increased sales of higher margin products in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Under GAAP, operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $119.3 million, or approximately 18.5% of sales. For the year, GAAP operating profit was $551.8 million, or approximately 21.4% of sales. Non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $159.4 million, or 24.7% of sales, compared to 24.8% of sales in the same period one year ago and 27.1% of sales in the immediately prior quarter. The sequential decline in non-GAAP operating profit was primarily due to lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, non-GAAP operating profit was $673.2 million, or 26.2% of sales, compared to 22.9% of sales in fiscal year 2005. Uses of Cash Capital expenditures totaled $41.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, or 6.5% of sales. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $129.3 million, or 5% of sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, ADI paid $55.6 million in cash dividends. For the year, dividend payments to shareholders totaled $201.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the company repurchased approximately 11.9 million shares of ADI common stock for $357.0 million. During the 2006 fiscal year, the company repurchased approximately 30.7 million shares of ADI common stock, or 9% of shares outstanding, for $1.03 billion. ADI has repurchased a cumulative total of approximately 14% of shares outstanding for $1.69 billion under the $2 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors. Balance Sheet Cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, inventory increased by approximately $1.2 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 128 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 126 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 49 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Revenue Analysis by Product During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, revenue from analog products totaled 84% of sales and revenue from DSP products totaled 16% of sales. During the fourth quarter, revenue from analog products grew 14% compared to the same period one year ago and 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Compared to the same period one year ago, data converter product sales grew 10%, amplifier product sales grew 22%, power management product sales grew 3%, and other analog product sales grew 27%. Compared to the immediately prior quarter, data converter product sales declined 1%, primarily due to more moderate sales to base station applications after very strong growth in the prior quarter and also due to continued weakness in the semiconductor automatic test equipment market. Amplifier product sales and power management product sales each grew 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Other analog product sales grew 12% compared to the immediately prior quarter due to increased demand for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) products and the acquisition of the Integrant RF tuner product line. During the fourth quarter, revenue from DSP products declined 31% compared to the same period one year ago and declined 21% compared to the immediately prior quarter. DSP product sales were significantly impacted by the divesture during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of the DSP-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) product line and also by an inventory correction among customers of our DSP-based wireless chipset products for cellular handsets. Approximately 9% of the Company's sales in the fourth quarter were from general-purpose DSP products, which grew 15% compared to the same period one year ago and 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, revenue from analog products grew 13%. Approximately 61% of sales in fiscal 2006 were attributed to converters and amplifiers, which, compared to the previous year, grew 10% and 19%, respectively. DSP product sales during fiscal year 2006 declined 11% compared to fiscal year 2005, primarily due to the divestiture during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of the DSP-based DSL ASIC product line which had $55 million in revenue in 2005 and $14 million in revenue in 2006. Excluding this product line, DSP product sales declined approximately 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, as the 10% annual revenue growth of general-purpose DSP products was offset by declines in application-specific DSP product revenue. We have provided a four year summary of our revenue by product type and end market on the investor relations page of our website to help investors better understand the long term trends in our business. Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. Product sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately $635 to $670 million. This includes an additional week of operations as the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will have a total of 14 weeks. In addition, revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will include a $35 million one-time, non-recurring payment received by the Company on November 9, 2006 in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to range from $670 to $705 million. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately 60% to 60.5% of sales. Due primarily to the fact that the one-time $35 million payment will not have any cost of sales associated with it, GAAP gross margin is planned to be approximately 61.2% to 61.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses are planned to increase by approximately $11 million primarily as a result of expenses associated with the additional week of operations within the first quarter of fiscal 2007. GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which includes approximately $0.02 of various net expenses detailed in the Summary of Estimated Non-GAAP Data for the First Quarter Ending February 3, 2007 Table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.38 to $0.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures, for revenue, net income, diluted EPS, gross margin and operating income, which exclude the effects of charges related to stock-based compensation, restructuring related expenses, acquisition related expenses, income tax benefits associated with the settlement of an IRS examination, gain on the sale of a product line, the tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, and non-recurring revenue associated with the license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Analog Devices believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. The Company's usage of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in this release. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-operational nature. The company believes that the exclusion of these items provides an enhanced understanding to investors of the underlying baseline operating results and trends of the company's business. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the company's operating performance. As described above, Analog Devices excludes the following items from our non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation related to employee stock options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. Further, as we implemented FAS 123R beginning in fiscal 2006, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of FAS 123R to our results of operations. Restructuring Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Gain on the Sale of a Product Line. We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations. Tax Benefit Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. The United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company has agreed to accept this report and has filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit have resulted in an income tax benefit. We exclude these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they are not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Expense Associated with the Repatriation of Foreign Earnings. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it was a temporary incentive and is not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment will increase revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. (e) Executive Performance Bonus Plan for Fiscal Year 2007 On December 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of an Executive Performance Bonus Plan for fiscal year 2007 (the "Executive Bonus Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the Executive Bonus Plan. Bonus payments under the Executive Bonus Plan are calculated and paid as follows: 1. Each participant's Fiscal 2007 Bonus Target is obtained by multiplying his or her Eligible Earnings by his or her Bonus Target Percentage: o Eligible Earnings - the individual's base pay during the applicable bonus period. o Bonus Target Percentage - a percentage of the individual's Eligible Earnings, determined individually for each participant by the Compensation Committee and ranging from 35% to 160%. 2. Each participant's Fiscal 2007 Bonus Target is then multiplied by the Bonus Payout Factor. The Bonus Payout Factor is based on the Company's operating profit before tax as a percentage of revenue for the applicable bonus period, which is adjustable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to exclude special items, including but not limited to: stock-based compensation expense, restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, gain or loss on disposition of businesses, non-recurring royalty payments, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. The Bonus Payout Factor can range from zero to three. The product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2007 Bonus Target by the Bonus Payout Factor shall be the Fiscal 2007 Bonus Payment for each participant. Each participant's Fiscal 2007 Bonus Payment can therefore be reduced to zero, or increased by up to three times his or her Fiscal 2007 Bonus Target. 3. Each participant's Fiscal 2007 Bonus Payment is then subject to adjustment by his or her Individual Payout Factor as follows. The Individual Payout Factor can increase the calculated bonus payment by as much as 50% or decrease the calculated bonus payment by as much as 50%, based on an evaluation of the participant's performance against a set of individual goals that are focused on key performance indicators, including business unit financial performance, strategic initiatives and overall leadership. At the end of fiscal year 2007, the Chief Executive Officer will review and assess the performance of each of the other participants with respect to his or her goals, and provide his recommendations thereon to the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee will review and assess the Chief Executive Officer's performance with respect to his goals. The Compensation Committee will then determine the Individual Payout Factor for the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other participants, based on the Committee's review and assessment of the performance of each individual toward his or her goals. 4. Bonus payments, if any, under the Executive Bonus Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and distributed after the first half and second half of fiscal year 2007. The Individual Payout Factor adjustments are only assessed and calculated annually at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, the distribution paid after the first half of fiscal year 2007 will be based only on paragraphs 1 and 2 above. Any Individual Payout Factor adjustments pursuant to paragraph 3 above will be assessed and calculated after the fiscal year end for the full fiscal year and applied only to the distribution which would be otherwise due and payable after the second half of fiscal year 2007 using the calculation described above.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 -- Q1 Revenue: $692 million, including $35 million technology license fee -- Q1 Diluted EPS: $0.44 GAAP; $0.40 non-GAAP -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share -- Financial results for the first quarter and guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm Business Editors NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 21, 2007--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended February 3, 2007. The first quarter of fiscal year 2007 was a 14-week quarter, as compared to the typical 13-week quarter, because ADI follows a 52-week (or 364-day) fiscal calendar which results in an additional week approximately every seventh year. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $692 million, which included $657 million of product revenue and $35 million of revenue from a one-time technology license. Product revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased approximately 6% compared to the same period one year ago and increased approximately 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $153 million, or 22% of total revenue, compared to $121 million for the same period one year ago and $138 million for the immediately prior quarter. The operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $35 million of revenue from a one-time technology license fee -- $8 million of non-operating income from the sale of an investment -- $20 million of non-cash stock option expenses -- $5.2 million of expenses related to restructuring actions -- $3.1 million of expenses related to previously-announced acquisitions -- An adjustment to the provision for taxes to reflect the tax effect of these items -- $10 million of tax savings associated with the reinstatement of the federal research and development (R&D) tax credit Together these items increased diluted EPS by $0.04. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in a table below. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $0.44, compared to $0.32 for the same period one year ago and $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.40, compared to $0.37 for the same period one year ago and $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock, an increase of $0.02 from the dividend paid on December 13, 2006. The dividend will be paid on March 28, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2007. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $417 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was $387 million, or 59.0% of product revenue, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 59.2% of product revenue in the same period one year ago and 59.4% of product revenue in the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin declined slightly compared to the immediately prior quarter primarily as a result of higher sales of products for consumer electronics and cellular handset applications, which carry relatively lower gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin was also constrained by continued low utilization rates in ADI factories. Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, totaled $163 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $156 million, or 23.8% of product revenue, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 25.7% of product revenue in the same period one year ago and 24.7% of product revenue in the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit declined compared to the immediately prior quarter primarily as a result of higher operating expenses associated with an additional week of expenses in the 14-week first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $208 million, or 30.1% of total revenue, compared to $175 million, or 28.2% of total revenue, in the same period one year ago and compared to $167 million, or 25.9% of total revenue, in the immediately prior quarter. -- Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $38 million. -- Cash dividends paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $54.7 million. -- Share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 10.1 million shares of ADI common stock (approximately 3% of total shares outstanding) totaled $333 million. -- The share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors had approximately $979 million remaining at the end of the first quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet -- Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled approximately $1.95 billion. -- Inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter, consistent with the increase in product revenue over the same period. -- Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 5% compared to accounts receivable at the end of the immediately prior quarter. A high rate of shipments in the last month of the first quarter was the primary reason for the increase. Revenue Analysis By End Market and By Product Category Revenue analysis is based on product revenue of $657 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the one-time $35 million technology license fee. Revenue Analysis By End Market -- Revenue from customers in the industrial market represented approximately 44% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the industrial market, which includes factory automation, medical and scientific instrumentation, automotive, security, and defense applications, increased by 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 14% compared to the same period one year ago. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from automotive and defense applications increased, while other areas of the industrial market were approximately flat. -- Revenue from customers in the communications market represented approximately 26% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the communications market increased by 7% compared to the immediately prior quarter and declined by 9% compared to the same period one year ago. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from base station and wireless handset applications increased, while revenue from other areas of the communications market was approximately flat or decreased. -- Revenue from customers in the consumer market represented approximately 20% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the consumer market increased by 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 35% compared to the same period one year ago primarily as a result of increased sales to manufacturers of digital home applications, including flat screen televisions and new video game controllers. -- Revenue from customers in the computer market represented approximately 10% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the computer market declined by 14% compared to the immediately prior quarter and declined by 20% compared to the same period one year ago primarily as a result of ADI's strategy to refocus power management products on portable applications and also due to a generally weak computer market in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue Analysis By Product Category Revenue from analog products totaled approximately $547 million, or 83% of product revenue, an increase of 1% compared to the immediately prior quarter and an increase of 13% compared to the same period one year ago. -- During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, revenue from converter and amplifier products represented approximately 61% of product revenue and, compared to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from converter and amplifier products declined slightly. Compared to the same period one year ago, revenue from converter and amplifier products increased by 13% and 14%, respectively. -- Revenue from other analog products such as micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) products and radio frequency (RF) integrated circuits increased significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the same period one year ago. Revenue from digital signal processing (DSP) products totaled approximately $110 million, or 17% of product revenue, an increase of 9% compared to the immediately prior quarter and a decrease of 20% compared to the same period one year ago. A significant portion of the year-to-year decline was due to the divestiture of the DSP-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network processor product line. -- Compared to the immediately prior quarter, DSP wireless chipset revenue increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 after declining in the prior quarter when customers' inventory corrections negatively impacted DSP product revenue. DSP wireless chipset revenue comprised 7% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. -- During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, revenue from general-purpose DSP products represented 9% of product revenue, was approximately flat compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 18% compared to the same period one year ago. Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. "Orders from customers and distributors began strengthening in January and have continued to be strong, which we believe is a positive sign of improving industry conditions," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Therefore, we are planning for good growth in our second fiscal quarter." -- Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately $640 to $670 million. -- Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately 58.5% to 59% of revenue. -- Operating expenses are planned to increase slightly in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of annual salary increases that take effect in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and increased R&D spending on new analog products. -- Diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, is planned to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.36. Diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to include approximately $0.06 of various net expenses detailed in the Summary of Estimated Stock-based Compensation, Restructuring- and Acquisition-Related Expenses for the Second Quarter Ending May 5, 2007 table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be $0.37 to $0.42. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the effects of charges related to non-recurring revenue associated with the license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party, gain on the sale of an investment, stock-based compensation, restructuring-related expenses, acquisition-related expenses, and an adjustment to the provision for taxes to reflect the tax effect of these items. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the income tax savings associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and the tax savings associated with an IRS tax settlement. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. The Company believes that the exclusion of these items provides an enhanced understanding to investors of the underlying baseline operating results and trends of the Company's business. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in this release. As described above, Analog Devices excludes the following items from our non-GAAP measures: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Gain on Sale of Investment. We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Stock-based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. The United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company has agreed to accept this report and has filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit have resulted in an income tax savings. We excluded these income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Analog Devices believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations, and provides our investors with some of the financial measures we use to manage our business. The Company's usage of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods. Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP financial information excludes the effects of: stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of FAS123R, restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, a one-time payment associated with the licensing of intellectual property, gain on sale of an investment, the impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and the tax savings associated with an IRS tax settlement. The provision for taxes has been adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect the tax effect of these items.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end market.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each product category.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 -- Q2 Revenue: $669 million -- Q2 Diluted EPS: $0.37 GAAP; $0.40 non-GAAP -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share -- Financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 22, 2007--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended May 5, 2007. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $669 million, an increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period one year ago. Compared to the immediately prior quarter's product revenue of $657 million, revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased approximately 2%. "ADI had a very good second quarter as the strong demand we began to see in January continued through the quarter," said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Our results were particularly strong considering that the second quarter of fiscal 2007 had one less week than the immediately prior quarter. On a normalized 13-week basis, order rates from end customers and revenue both grew sequentially by 10%." (ADI follows a 52-week, or 364-day, fiscal calendar which results in a 14-week quarter approximately every seventh year, as occurred in the immediately prior quarter.) Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $125 million, or 19% of revenue, compared to $146 million for the same period one year ago and $153 million for the immediately prior quarter. The results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $17.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to employee stock options, or $0.037 on a diluted earnings per share (EPS) basis. -- $10.1 million of expenses related to restructuring actions, or $0.019 on a diluted EPS basis. Approximately $6.7 million of this amount related to the final shutdown of the Company's wafer fabrication facility in California. -- $2.9 million of expenses related to previously announced acquisitions, or $0.006 on a diluted EPS basis. -- $19 million received in the settlement of litigation against Maxim Integrated Products regarding misappropriation of ADI's intellectual property rights, or $0.036 on a diluted EPS basis. Of this amount, $8.5 million was for the reimbursement of legal expenses included in general and administrative expenses and the remaining $10.5 million of the settlement was included in non-operating income. None of these amounts were included in revenue. -- The provision for taxes includes the tax effect of these items. Together these items represented the $0.03 difference between GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in a table below. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $0.37, compared to $0.39 for the same period one year ago and $0.44 for the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.40, compared to $0.41 for the same period one year ago and $0.40 for the immediately prior quarter. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 20, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2007. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $382 million or 57% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margin was reduced by $4.8 million, or 0.8% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expense. Gross margin declined compared to the immediately prior quarter primarily as a result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics and cellular handsets, which generally carry slightly lower gross margins than the Company average. Gross margin was also adversely impacted by the Company's decision to continue constraining utilization levels within internal manufacturing facilities to better balance production, demand, and inventory levels. As a result, inventory declined 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter. Operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, totaled $132 million, or 19.7% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, operating profit was reduced by $21.9 million, or 3.3% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by the reimbursement of legal expenses from the litigation settlement described above. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $239 million, or 35.7% of revenue, compared to $205 million, or 31.9% of revenue, in the same period one year ago and compared to $208 million, or 30.1% of total revenue, in the immediately prior quarter. -- Capital expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $39.7 million. -- Cash dividends paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $59.6 million. -- Share repurchases during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 10.3 million shares of ADI common stock (approximately 3% of total shares outstanding) totaled $365 million. -- As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the total shares repurchased under the program authorized by the Board of Directors totaled approximately $2.4 billion and represented approximately 19% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal year 2004. -- The share repurchase program had approximately $615 million remaining at the end of the second quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet -- Cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled approximately $1.8 billion. -- Inventory at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased 1% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 121 days at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007. -- Accounts receivable at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased 4% compared to accounts receivable at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable was 45 days in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The tables, "Revenue Trends By End Market" and "Revenue Trends By Product," provided below, summarize revenue by end market and by product for the second quarter, immediately prior quarter and year-ago quarter. Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. -- Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be in the range of $655 to $685 million. -- Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately the same as the second quarter, primarily as a result of the plan to continue constraining manufacturing utilization levels within ADI factories. Manufacturing utilization is planned to begin increasing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. -- Operating expenses are planned to be flat to slightly higher in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter based on the Company's plan to continue increasing R&D spending on new analog products while reducing spending in other areas. -- Diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, is planned to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.37. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to include approximately $0.04 of various net expenses detailed in the Assumptions Used to Estimate Results for the Third Quarter Ending August 4, 2007 table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be $0.37 to $0.41.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Company's business. Our budgets are determined excluding the items listed below and management's performance is assessed using these non-GAAP operating metrics. Management has also established employee and executive profit sharing bonus plans that use non-GAAP operating income as the metric to determine any bonus payout. Economic Substance Behind Management's Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations.

The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Gain on Sale of Investment. We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Gain on Sale of a Product Line. We realized a gain of $13 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 from the sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.

The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company. Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Management's Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. About Analog Devices, Inc.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end market. --------------------- --------- --------- Three Three Months Months Three Months Ended Ended Ended May 5, 2007 February April 29, 3, 2007 2006 (14 weeks)* ----------------------------------------- Revenue Y/Y Q/Q Revenue Revenue % % %* ------------------------------- --------- Industrial $288,955 43% 6% -1% $290,975 $273,065 Communications 188,505 28% -1% 10% 171,685 190,782 Consumer 136,478 21% 26% 4% 130,626 108,414 Computer 55,194 8%-23%-13% 63,328 71,611 --------------------- --------- --------- Total Product Revenue $669,132 100% 4% 2% $656,614 $643,872 --------------------- --------- --------- One-time payment assoc. with the licensing of IP - 35,000 - --------- --------- --------- Total Revenue $669,132 $691,614 $643,872 ========= ========= ========= Revenue Trends by Product - -------------------------------------- The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.

In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance.

Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 -- Q3 Revenue: $680 million, 3% annual growth, 2% sequential growth -- Q3 Diluted EPS: $0.37 GAAP; $0.41 non-GAAP -- Company repurchased $632 million of ADI common stock during Q3 -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share -- Financial results for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 21, 2007--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended August 4, 2007. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $680 million, an increase of approximately 3% compared to the same period one year ago and 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. "The third quarter was another solid quarter for ADI, turning out largely as we had planned in terms of our revenue growth, product sales mix, and operating expenses," said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Order rates remained strong during the third quarter in both the OEM and distribution channels." Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $120 million, or 18% of sales, compared to $145 million for the same period one year ago and $125 million for the immediately prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $0.37, compared to $0.39 for the same period one year ago and $0.37 for the immediately prior quarter. The results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $17.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to employee stock options, or $0.037 on a diluted earnings per share (EPS) basis. -- $2.8 million of expenses related to previously announced acquisitions, or $0.006 on a diluted EPS basis. -- The provision for taxes includes the tax effect of these items. Together these items represented the $0.04 difference between GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.41. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in a table below. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $389 million, or 57.1% of sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margin was reduced by $4.5 million, or 0.7% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expense. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately equal to the immediately prior quarter as planned. Inventory declined $10.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, totaled $138 million, or 20.2% of sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, operating profit was reduced by $20 million, or 3.0% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $191 million, or 28% of sales. Capital expenditures for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $31 million. Cash dividends paid during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $59 million. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock which will be paid on September 19, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2007. Share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 16.9 million shares of ADI common stock totaled $632 million and represented approximately 5.2% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the third quarter. -- As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the total shares repurchased under the program authorized by the Board of Directors totaled approximately $3 billion and represented approximately 22.8% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, the start of this repurchase program. -- The share repurchase program had approximately $983 million remaining at the end of the third quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet -- Inventory at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 116 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 121 days at the end of last quarter and 126 days a year ago. -- Days sales in accounts receivable was 47 days in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 45 days in the immediately prior quarter. The tables, "Revenue Trends By End Market" and "Revenue Trends By Product," provided below, summarize revenue by end market and by product for the third quarter, the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. Highlights: -- Analog product revenue, which comprised 84% of total revenue in the third quarter, increased 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. The sequential revenue growth was driven by the data converter, amplifier, power management, and radio frequency product categories. -- General-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) product revenue, which comprised 8% of total revenue in the third quarter, increased 7% compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Revenue from the broad based industrial end market comprised 43% of total sales in the third quarter. Revenue from industrial instrumentation and test equipment customers increased compared to the immediately prior quarter, while revenue from other industrial applications declined. Overall, revenue from industrial customers was flat in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Revenue from communications infrastructure customers increased in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter driven by 13% growth in revenue from basestation and networking equipment customers. -- Revenue from consumer and computer customers increased 3% and 9%, respectively, in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. -- Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be in the range of $680 to $710 million. -- Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately the same as the third quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter ADI derives a higher percentage of revenue from products used in consumer applications which have relatively lower gross margin than most of the other end markets ADI serves. -- Operating expenses are planned to be flat to slightly higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, is planned to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to include approximately $0.05 of various net expenses detailed in the Assumptions Used to Estimate Results for the Fourth Quarter Ending November 3, 2007 table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be $0.41 to $0.45. Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 Mr. Fishman will discuss the third quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI." A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 10972510 or by visiting the Investor Relations page on ADI's web site. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Company's business. Our budgets are determined excluding the items listed below and management's performance is assessed using these non-GAAP operating metrics. Management has also established employee and executive profit sharing bonus plans that use non-GAAP operating income as the metric to determine any bonus payout. Economic Substance Behind Management's Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude this and the related tax effects primarily because it is a non-cash expense, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million.

The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company. Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Management's Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. About Analog Devices, Inc.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of the Registrant, dated September 10, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 MediaTek to Acquire Analog Devices Cellular Handset Radio and Baseband Chipset Operations HSINCHU, Taiwan & NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 10, 2007--MediaTek, Inc. (TWSE: 2454, "MediaTek"), one of the world's leading fabless semiconductor companies for wireless communications and digital media solutions, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets related to the Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) Othello(R) radio and SoftFone(R) baseband chipset product lines, as well as certain cellular handset baseband support operations, for approximately US$350 million in cash. These product lines represented approximately US$230 million in revenue for ADI, based on fiscal year 2006 financial results. Through this acquisition, MediaTek's wireless handset division gains: a global team of approximately 400 experienced product development and customer support professionals; an established customer base around the world; new radio transceiver and baseband chipset products, including GSM, GPRS, EDGE, WCDMA, and TD-SCDMA chipsets, to further strengthen its existing portfolio; and key patents and intellectual property to increase MediaTek's competitiveness. ADI plans to continue to invest in the wireless handset market by focusing on developing high-performance analog, micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), and programmable digital signal processing (DSP) products that enhance the audio, video, connectivity, and power efficiency capabilities in a range of wireless multimedia devices. According to Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and CEO, "This transaction will allow ADI to focus our resources in areas where our signal processing expertise can provide unique capabilities and earn superior returns. In addition, it unlocks the value of the Othello and SoftFone operations by creating the scale needed to support the R&D investment required for sustainable, long-term success." "This is a winning transaction for customers of both companies," said JiChang Hsu, general manager of MediaTek's wireless business. "With these added resources, our customers will be assured a roadmap of innovative solutions supported by a talented team that is focused on the needs of the wireless handset industry. Moreover, this acquisition will also bolster MediaTek's global operations and development in converging consumer solutions." The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction, which is expected to close near the end of 2007, following the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions. Tax assessments and any additional closing costs will reduce the net amount of proceeds received by ADI from the transaction. In ADI's recently completed third quarter of fiscal year 2007, revenue from these product lines represented $43 million, or 6% of revenue. ADI plans to account for the divested operations as a discontinued operation. Excluding these operations, ADI estimates that its third quarter of fiscal year 2007 gross margin as a percentage of revenue would have been approximately 170 basis points higher, operating margin as a percentage of revenue would have been approximately 200 basis points higher, and diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $0.01 higher.

Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Pursuant to the Employment Agreement dated November 14, 2005 between Analog Devices, Inc. ("Analog") and Jerald G. Fishman, Analog and Mr. Fishman entered into an Executive Retention Agreement on October 22, 2007. This agreement is designed to retain Mr. Fishman as Chief Executive Officer of Analog at least through fiscal year 2010 (the "Retention Period"), which the Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of Analog. The Executive Retention Agreement provides for annual performance-based cash incentives and is designed to closely align the amounts that Mr. Fishman may earn thereunder with the performance of Analog during the Retention Period.
The incentives provided in the Executive Retention Agreement are in lieu of any additional equity grants to Mr. Fishman during the Retention Period.
Pursuant to the Executive Retention Agreement, provided that Mr. Fishman's employment with Analog does not terminate prior to the conclusion of the Retention Period, Analog will credit to an account established for Mr. Fishman under Analog's Deferred Compensation Plan an amount equal to $5,000,000 plus the sum of the following: for each of fiscal 2008, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, an amount equal to the annual bonus earned by Mr. Fishman under Analog's executive performance bonus plan with respect to such fiscal year, multiplied by two (2). The maximum amount that shall be contributed with respect to any particular fiscal year (after applying the multiplier of two) shall be $5,000,000.
Analog's executive performance bonus plan for each fiscal year is subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee. The specific metrics applicable to the calculation of Mr. Fishman's annual bonus shall be established by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, and may vary from year to year. Mr. Fishman's annual bonus target percentage under the applicable executive performance bonus plan shall be 160% of his then annual base salary. Mr. Fishman's current annual base salary is $930,935.
If, prior to the conclusion of the Retention Period, Mr. Fishman's employment with Analog terminates as a result of termination by Analog without "Cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), termination by Mr. Fishman for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), or termination under circumstances that give rise to severance payments under Mr. Fishman's Employee Retention Agreement dated January 16, 1989, then Analog shall credit to an account established for Mr. Fishman under Analog's Deferred Compensation Plan an amount (determined in accordance with the Executive Retention Agreement) that is equivalent to the amount that would have been credited if he had remained employed through the end of the Retention Period and earned annual target bonuses.
No portion of the Retention Amount shall accrue or be credited with any investment earnings or interest prior to such time as it is credited to an account established for Mr. Fishman under Analog's Deferred Compensation Plan.
If payments to Mr. Fishman under the Executive Retention Agreement would result in the triggering of the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Analog shall pay to Mr. Fishman an additional amount such that the net amount Mr. Fishman retains after paying any excise tax and any federal, state or local income or FICA taxes on such additional amount shall be equal to the amount he would have received if the taxes paid pursuant to Sections 280G and 4999 were not applicable.
In connection with the Executive Retention Agreement, Analog and Mr. Fishman amended his 1989 Employee Retention Agreement and 2005 Employment Agreement to comply with regulations recently promulgated under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and to align certain provisions thereof with the Executive Retention Agreement.
The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Employment Agreement, the Executive Retention Agreement and other agreements filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
"(i) the Company shall pay to you your full base salary and all other compensation through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time the Notice of Termination is given, no later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination, plus all other amounts to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company at the time such payments are due."
"; provided, however that (i) you must incur such expenses during the Term of the Agreement or thereafter and before the date on which the statute of limitations has expired, including any extensions, with respect to any claims arising in connection with such termination or the payment or provision or failure to pay or provide any rights or benefits under this Agreement, (ii) such reimbursement must be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the taxable year in which the expense is incurred, (iii) the expenses eligible for reimbursement under this provision may not affect the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year, and (iv) you may not cash out the right to this reimbursement or exchange it for another benefit."
"either by paying the cost of your continued participation in the Company's health benefit plans or the cost of comparable health benefits to those you previously received under the Company health benefit plans, from other sources, if such continued
 
participation cannot be provided by the Company for the entire period, or, with respect to life, disability and accident benefits the Company previously provided for you, by paying you a lump sum, within 30 days, which is equal to the estimated cost to you of obtaining those benefits to the extent they are available on a commercially reasonable basis, as determined by the Company, in good faith."
"(d) Any benefits you receive under this Agreement will be treated, as applicable, as part of the "Payments" covered by Section 3(b) of the Long-Term Retention Agreement entered into by you and Company, dated October 22, 2007, for purposes of the "Section 4999 Gross-Up Payment" as defined in such agreement."

Thus, the Company's fourth quarter revenue excluded $50 million from this business. Please refer to the section below titled "Divestitures" for more information. ADI has excluded only one-time or non-recurring items from non-GAAP measures. Commencing in the fourth quarter, we are no longer excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related expense from our non-GAAP measures. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in a table below. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended November 3, 2007. Results for the entire fiscal year are included under the heading, Summary for the Fiscal Year 2007. Revenue Revenue from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $648.5 million, an increase of approximately 6% compared to the same period one year ago and an increase of approximately 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter excluded $50.3 million from discontinued operations. "The fourth quarter was a solid quarter for ADI," said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Revenue and earnings were in line with our expectations for the quarter. We are entering 2008 with a better balanced product portfolio, capable of good growth and strong profit leverage." Diluted EPS of $0.31 Included $0.08 for Restructuring Expense & Tax Adjustments Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a non-GAAP basis for continuing operations, was $0.39, compared to $0.35 for the same period one year ago and $0.38 for the immediately prior quarter. The results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $25 million charge, or $0.064 on a diluted EPS basis, related to planned operating expense reductions and the decision to transfer wafer production capacity at ADI's Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility from 6" to 8" technology -- $4.4 million charge, or $0.014 on a diluted EPS basis, which is a one-time tax adjustment related to the IRS examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 Together these items represented the $0.08 difference between GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.39. Fourth Quarter Revenue Summary The tables, "Revenue Trends By End Market" and "Revenue Trends By Product," provided below, summarize revenue by end market and by product for the fourth quarter, the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, as well as for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Revenue growth during the fourth quarter was highest for consumer products, which grew by 17% compared to the same period one year ago and grew sequentially by 11%. Sequential growth was driven by very strong sales growth from products used in digital cameras and digital TVs. Revenue from consumer products represented 23% of revenue in the fourth quarter. Industrial customer revenue represented 46% of revenue in the fourth quarter, increased 4% compared to the same period one year ago, and was approximately equal to the immediately prior quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue within the industrial category increased for the automotive and the defense end markets, decreased for semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), and was unchanged for the broad base of industrial customers. Communications customer revenue represented 21% of revenue in the fourth quarter, increased 9% from the same quarter last year, and declined sequentially by 7%. After strong growth last quarter, revenue from base station and networking customers declined sequentially. Computer customer revenue was 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter and declined 8% from the same quarter last year. Revenue from computer customers grew 13% sequentially, in-line with industry trends. By geographic region, revenue for the fourth quarter increased sequentially in Europe by 9%, in North America by 4%, and in Japan by 5%. Revenue decreased in China by 14%, following very strong sequential growth in the prior quarter, and was relatively unchanged in the rest of Asia Pacific. Gross Margin Gross margin from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $379 million, or 58.4% of revenue. Gross margin declined sequentially by 50 basis points due to strong sequential revenue growth from products used in consumer and computer applications, which in aggregate have gross margin below the Company average, and sequential revenue declines from products used in semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE) and communications base station and networking applications, which have gross margin above the Company average. Operating Profit Operating profit from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $121 million, or 18.7% of revenue. Operating profit was reduced by $25 million, or 3.9% of revenue, as a result of restructuring-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit was 22.6% of revenue, which was equal to the prior quarter. Net Cash Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $183 million, or 28.2% of revenue. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $33 million, or 5% of revenue. Cash Dividend Cash dividends paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $55 million. On November 26, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock which will be paid on December 26, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2007. Shares Outstanding Decreased 11% Compared to Year-Ago Quarter Share repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 8.6 million shares of ADI common stock totaled $318 million and represented approximately 2.8% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. -- $3.3 billion in share repurchases, representing approximately 95 million shares, or 25.1% of the shares outstanding, have been repurchased since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004. -- The share repurchase program had approximately $665 million in authorization remaining at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased $11 million, or approximately 3%, compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of revenue in inventory was 118 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 133 days a year ago and 125 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable was 47 days, unchanged from the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable was 46 days at the end of fiscal year 2006. Summary for the Fiscal Year 2007 2007 Product Highlights: -- Product revenue grew 7% in fiscal year 2007 and totaled $2.5 billion. Product revenue excludes the one-time payment of $35 million received in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. -- Analog product revenue represented 90% of product revenue for ADI and increased 9% in fiscal 2007. -- Converter product revenue represented 44% of product revenue and increased 8% for the year. -- Amplifier product revenue represented 22% of product revenue and increased 5% for the year. -- Power management and reference revenue represented 8% of product revenue and declined 6% for the year. Excluding the CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring product line, which is planned to be divested, revenue declined 2% for the year. -- Revenue from other analog products, such as Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Radio Frequency (RF) products, represented 16% of product revenue and increased 27% for the year. -- General-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) product revenue represented 9% of product revenue and increased 4% for the year. 2007 End Market Highlights: -- More than $1 billion in revenue, or 47% of product revenue, came from the broad based industrial end market in fiscal year 2007, a 7% increase year-to-year. Medical, security, automotive, defense, and instrumentation applications all contributed to growth during the year. -- Revenue from consumer applications was 22% of product revenue and grew significantly during 2007, increasing 23%, with digital TVs, digital cameras, home theatre and video games as the primary drivers. -- Revenue from communications applications was 22% of product revenue and increased 7% during 2007. -- Revenue from computer applications was 9% of product revenue and declined 17% year-to-year, primarily as a result of the Company's decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $820 million, or 32.2% of total revenue in fiscal year 2007, compared to $621 million, or 26.5% of total revenue, in the prior year. Gross margin totaled $1.5 billion, or 59.7% of revenue, for the fiscal year 2007. In the prior year, gross margin totaled $1.4 billion, or 59.9% of revenue, and included approximately $20 million, or 0.9% of revenue, in restructuring related expenses. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2007 compared to 60.8% in the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined compared to the prior year primarily as a result of strong growth in revenue from products used in consumer applications where gross margin as a percentage of revenue is generally below the Company average. Operating expenses totaled $953 million in fiscal year 2007 compared to $881 million in the prior year. In fiscal year 2007, ADI increased spending in R&D by approximately $50 million, primarily to support strategic analog product development programs. In addition, in fiscal year 2007, the Company recorded $40 million in special charges. Operating margin totaled $566 million, or 22.2% of revenue, for the fiscal year 2007. Excluding non-recurring or one time items, non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product revenue was 22.4% in fiscal 2007 versus 24.2% in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the decline in gross margin. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.51 for the fiscal year 2007, compared to $1.39 for the prior year. Excluding non-recurring or one time items, non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.48 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $1.35 in the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of the share repurchases which reduced the diluted shares 10.4%. Divestitures During the fourth quarter, on September 9, 2007, ADI signed a definitive agreement to sell its wireless handset baseband chipset and radio transceiver operation. This business represented $50.3 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The previously announced divestiture of this business is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. ADI has accounted for the divested operation as a discontinued operation. Assets and liabilities related to this business, including inventory, accounts receivable, and property plant and equipment have been reclassified as such. After accounting for assets included in the sale and other costs, the sale is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $280 to $290 million and an after tax gain of approximately $150 to $160 million. After accounting for the wireless handset baseband and radio business as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points and non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased 160 basis points. Diluted EPS was unchanged. "The financial rationale for divesting this business is important, but equally important is the improved strategic clarity this brings to our ongoing investment decisions," explained Mr. Fishman. "We plan to continue to develop other products for the wireless handset market, but we will focus our investments in products where we offer technology that is differentiated and provides sustainable value to leading handset manufacturers -- products that improve energy efficiency, music and voice quality, picture quality, and the overall user experience." On November 8, 2007, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, ADI signed a definitive agreement to sell its CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring operation. This business represented approximately $25 million of revenue during the fourth quarter. The previously announced divestiture of this business is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This business is reported with continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and will be included in discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. To facilitate an orderly transfer of the business to the buyer, at closing ADI expects to enter into a pre-paid one-year manufacturing supply arrangement whereby ADI will continue to manufacture the products at its wafer fabrication facility in Limerick, Ireland. After accounting for assets included in the sale, other costs and the prepaid manufacturing supply agreement, the sale is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $85 to $92 million and an after tax gain of approximately $52 to $60 million. Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2008 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the CPU Voltage Regulation and PC Thermal Monitoring business will be accounted for as a discontinued operation. Please refer to the table, "Assumptions Used to Estimate Results for the First Quarter Ending February 2, 2008," or Schedule H, for details. -- Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of +2% to -2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. -- Gross margin from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be slightly above 60% of revenue. -- Operating expenses from continuing operations are planned to decrease slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the immediately prior quarter, excluding the restructuring expense recorded in the fourth quarter and accounting for the CPU Voltage Regulation and PC Thermal Monitoring business as a discontinued operation. -- The tax rate for the first quarter is estimated at 23% to 25%. -- Non-operating income for the first quarter is estimated at $15 million. -- Shares used for the diluted EPS calculation are estimated at 311 million. -- Excluding the gains from the sales of the divested businesses, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Company's business. Economic Substance Behind Management's Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses: Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Acquisition-Related Expense. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax adjustment when we finalized the accounting associated with our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 acquisition. We excluded this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it was not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the One-Time Settlement of Litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Gain on Sale of Investment. We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Gain on the Sale of a Product Line. We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations. Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although the IRS has not issued its final report for fiscal 2004 and 2005, they have issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. We have provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company. Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Management's Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. About Analog Devices, Inc.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods.

However, the Indemnitor can settle the claim without the consent of the Indemnified Parties so long as a full and unconditional release is provided to the Indemnified Parties and no agreed order, consent judgment, admission of fault, or the like is entered to the prejudice of the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the election of the Indemnitor to assume the defense and investigation of such claim, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel and participate in the defense and investigation of such claim at their sole cost.

2008 Executive Bonus Plan
          On January 22, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2008 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Executive Bonus Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the Executive Bonus Plan. Bonus payments under the Executive Bonus Plan are calculated and paid as follows:
          1. Each participant's Fiscal 2008 Bonus Target is obtained by multiplying his or her Base Salary by his or her Individual Target Bonus Percentage:
          2. Each participant's Fiscal 2008 Bonus Target is then multiplied by the Bonus Payout Factor. The Bonus Payout Factor is based on the Company's operating profit before tax (OPBT) as a percentage of revenue for the applicable bonus period, which is adjustable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to exclude special items, including but not limited to: restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, gain or loss on disposition of businesses, non-recurring royalty payments, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. The Bonus Payout Factor can range from 0% to 300%.
          The Compensation Committee adopted the following Bonus Payout Factor table under the Executive Bonus Plan:
          The Bonus Payout Factor is determined quarterly and is also used to determine the bonuses paid to all other employees of the Company under the Company's 2008 Profit Sharing Plan for Employees.
          The product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2008 Bonus Target by the Bonus Payout Factor shall be the Fiscal 2008 Bonus Payment for each participant. Each participant's Fiscal 2008 Bonus Payment can therefore be reduced to zero, or increased by up to three times his or her Fiscal 2008 Bonus Target.
          3. Each participant in the Executive Bonus Plan, other than Ray Stata and Jerald Fishman, is eligible for an additional Individual Payout Factor that can increase the calculated bonus payment by up to 30% based on superior business performance. Evidence of superior business performance will include, but is not limited to, overachievement of revenue and profitability goals, and achievement of non-financial results that contributed positively to the performance of the Company. At the end of fiscal year 2008, the Chief Executive Officer will review and assess the performance of each of the eligible participants with respect to his or her goals, and will provide his recommendations regarding each participant's performance to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will then, in its discretion, determine whether there is superior performance justifying the application of an Individual Payout Factor.
 
4. Fiscal 2008 Bonus Payments, if any, under the Executive Bonus Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and distributed after the first half and second half of fiscal year 2008. In the event that the Compensation Committee determines that a participant should receive an Individual Payout Factor, such amount would be distributed to the participant after the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, the distribution paid after the first half of fiscal year 2008 will be based only on paragraphs 1 and 2 above, while the distribution paid after the fiscal year end will be based on paragraphs 1 and 2 above and will also include any amount based on the application of the Individual Payout Factor as described in paragraph 3 above.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2008
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI):
Except where noted, all financial results contained in this release are from continuing operations.
The sales of two businesses, the wireless handset baseband chipset and radio transceiver business and the CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business, were completed as planned during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. These two businesses are reported as discontinued operations.
Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended February 2, 2008.
Product revenue decreased by 1.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased approximately 4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which was a 14-week quarter. ADI follows a 52-week, or 364-day, fiscal calendar which results in a 14-week quarter approximately every seventh year, as occurred in the first quarter of last year. On an equivalent 13-week basis, product revenue increased 12% year-over-year.
Product revenue was $614 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
was $376 million, or 61.2% of revenue, compared to $374 million, or 60.0% of revenue, in the immediately prior quarter. Gross margin improved primarily as a result of increased sales to the industrial and communications end markets, which carry relatively higher gross margins than the consumer and computer end markets. Gross margin for the same period one year ago, excluding $35 million of revenue from a one-time intellectual property (IP) licensing agreement, was 61.7% of revenue.
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2008
totaled $146 million, or 23.8% of product revenue. After excluding one-time items from the prior periods, operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.
Operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008
was $0.40. On a comparable basis, the non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.37 for the same period one year ago and $0.38 for the immediately prior quarter. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP diluted EPS to GAAP diluted EPS are provided in this release on Schedule F.
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008
was $0.82, which included $0.01 from discontinued operations and $0.81 from the gain on the sales of two businesses.
Diluted EPS from discontinued operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008
of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 26, 2008 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2008.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2008
totaled $177 million, or 28.9% of total revenue, compared to $183 million, or 29.3% of total revenue, in the immediately prior quarter and $208 million, or 33.2% of total revenue, in the same period one year ago.
Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2008
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled $40 million.
Cash dividends paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled $54 million.
Share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 12 million shares of ADI common stock (approximately 4% of total shares outstanding) totaled $359 million.
The share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors had approximately $306 million remaining at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Balance Sheet
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled approximately $1.3 billion.
Inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 increased by approximately $6 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 127 days at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to 119 days in the immediately prior quarter.
Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 5% compared to accounts receivable at the end of the immediately prior quarter. A high rate of shipments in the last month of the first quarter was the primary reason for the increase.
Sequential Revenue Analysis for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2008
Industrial Market: 49% of product revenue
Revenue from the industrial market, which includes factory automation, medical and scientific instrumentation, automotive, security, and defense applications, increased by 1% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Within this end market, revenue from automotive and semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE) applications decreased, while revenue from other instrumentation and defense applications increased.
Communications Market: 23% of product revenue
Revenue from the communications market increased by 6% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Wireless infrastructure applications, as well as analog products used in mobile devices, drove the sequential increase in revenue.
Consumer Market: 22% of product revenue
Revenue from consumer customers decreased sequentially by 12% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 after an 11% sequential increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which was consistent with normal seasonal trends.
Computer Market: 6% of product revenue
Revenue from the computer market declined by 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter after strong sequential gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 in preparation for the holiday season.
With the divestitures of two businesses completed, we have improved our product portfolio by focusing on areas where innovative signal processing technologies can give our customers a competitive edge and our shareholders strong returns, said Jerald G. Fishman, ADIs president and chief executive officer. These strategic initiatives led to increased margins in the first quarter and are expected to continue to drive further improvements in our long-term financial performance.
Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2008
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, Mr. Fishman said, Order rates improved and the backlog increased in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter, providing us with a positive outlook for second quarter demand. At the same time, we are mindful of ongoing concerns about the general economy.
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of $615 to $640 million, or approximately flat to up 4% on a sequential basis.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be approximately equal to the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Operating expenses are planned to increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of annual salary increases which took effect at the beginning of the quarter.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.42. Diluted EPS from discontinued operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be $0.01.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00
Mr. Fishman will discuss the first quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible from www.analog.com, today beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 34214341 or by visiting the Investor Relations page on ADI's web site.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Management
s Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin:
On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income:
On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax adjustment when we finalized the accounting associated with an acquisition which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We excluded this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it was not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Acquisition-Related Expense.
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results.
Gain on Sale of Investment.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. They have issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. We have provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination.
The R&D tax credit was reinstated in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Management
s Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

ADI had a very strong quarter driven by continued momentum of our broad, highly diversified core business, as well as increased penetration of new product categories and fast-growing applications, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Our significant growth on both the top and bottom lines reflects our leading converter and amplifier positions as well as the benefits of strategic investments and product portfolio decisions weve made over the last few years. Most importantly, our results continue to demonstrate the value that customers place on innovating and collaborating with ADI to solve the toughest signal processing challenges and achieve competitive advantage.
:
Revenue by end market in the second quarter of fiscal 2008
The industrial and communications end markets produced strong growth in the quarter, with sales to both increasing on a sequential and year-over-year basis.

Revenue from communications customers increased 10% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. The sequential growth in the communications market was principally driven by very strong growth in revenue from base station applications.
Revenue from consumer customers was down slightly both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending in response to the uncertain economic environment.

Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2008
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Mr. Fishman said, Orders remained strong in the second quarter, and increased in comparison to the immediately prior quarter. Our operating plan for the third quarter is for revenue to be in the range of $650 to $665 million, or flat to up 3% sequentially, gross margin to be approximately 61%, and operating expenses to increase slightly. However, our plan does not factor in potential effects of ongoing financial market uncertainty which could translate into a more cautious stance from our customers. If the operating plan is achieved, diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $0.43 to $0.45 and diluted EPS from discontinued operations is expected to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00
Mr. Fishman will discuss the second quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible at today beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Management
s Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.

A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement.
We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results.
Gain on Sale of Investment.
We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations.
Gain on the Sale of a Product Line.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although the IRS has not issued its final report for fiscal 2004 and 2005, they have issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. We have provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it was a temporary incentive and is not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Tax Expense Associated with the Repatriation of Foreign Earnings.
The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

On May 30, 2008, Analog Devices, Inc. issued a press release announcing the settlement by the Company and its President and CEO, Mr. Jerald G.

Neither the Company nor Mr. Fishman admitted or denied any of the Commissions allegations or findings.
As previously disclosed, the Commission concluded that: the appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options should have been September 8, 1998 (which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been November 29, 1999 (which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used to price the options); and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should have been July 26, 2001 (which is five trading days later than the date that was used to price the options). The Commission did not charge the Company or Mr. Fishman with any violation of law related to the granting of options prior to the release of favorable financial results.
In connection with the settlement, the Company consented to a cease-and-desist order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and agreed to reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman in 1999 and 2001. No other options granted by the Company are affected by the settlement.

The Company first disclosed the SECs investigation into its stock option granting practices in its 2004 Form 10-K filing. As previously disclosed by the Company, the SEC order concludes that the appropriate grant dates for three stock option grants made by the Company in 1998, 1999 and 2001 should have been as follows: the September 4, 1998 grant date should have been one trading day later (September 8, 1998); the November 30, 1999 grant date should have been one trading day earlier (November 29, 1999); and the July 18, 2001 grant date should have been five trading days later (July 26, 2001). With respect to these three option grants, there is no allegation or finding that Mr. Fishman acted with bad intent or recklessness; the claim as to Mr. Fishman is solely under Section 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.
As disclosed in the Companys Form 10-Q filing in February of 2008, the Commission did not charge either the Company or Mr. Fishman with respect to grants of options prior to the release of favorable financial results.

NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 24, 2008--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 1, 2008.
The fourth quarter culminated a year of solid performance for ADI. We entered the year with a rebalanced, higher margin product portfolio and an intensified focus on our core businesses. This strategy led to increased revenue and significant earnings growth for ADI in 2008, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. While we exited the year faced with very difficult global economic conditions, we believe this focus on our market-leading core signal processing technologies gives us a competitive advantage that will endure throughout and beyond the current downturn.
Mr. Fishman continued, As we enter fiscal 2009, we plan to further concentrate our investment on these top priorities, and reduce spending in areas that offer less opportunity for differentiation and growth. Weve also undertaken other expense management actions to align our cost structure with a demand environment recently reshaped by the global credit crisis. These actions are expected to provide expense savings in the first quarter, and additional savings and margin benefits in subsequent quarters.

Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2009
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the revenue outlook for the company for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Mr. Fishman said, The global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in much more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand. Order rates slowed in late September, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our short-term visibility. Forecasting revenue in this environment is very difficult. Our operating plan is for revenues to decline sequentially by approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are planning to take steps to avoid a large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing output, which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. We are therefore planning for gross margin to be approximately 57% to 58% in the first quarter, depending on the actual product mix and level of sales we achieve. Further, we are planning to take actions that we expect will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter levels of approximately 10%, or $25 million. We expect to realize over half of that savings in the first quarter and the balance in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we plan to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter. Assuming these levels of sales, gross margin, and cost reduction, EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter would be approximately $0.22 to $0.23, excluding restructuring charges.
We are responding to the current economic environment by taking actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the short term while strengthening our position for the long term, Mr. Fishman continued. We anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions will modulate with general economic conditions, while the actions related to realigning our product portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will result in short-term savings as well as a fundamentally lower cost structure. As such, we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the short term reduction in our earnings while at the same time positioning ADI for significant earnings leverage when growth resumes.

Mr. Fishman will discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results, as well as the short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at today beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Tables reconciling the Companys non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin:
On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.

We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax adjustment when we finalized the accounting associated with an acquisition which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We excluded this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it was not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Acquisition-Related Expense.
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million.

We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.
We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results.
Gain on Sale of Investment.
The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This credit expired during our first fiscal quarter of 2008, but was reinstated again during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, retroactive to January 1, 2008. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $3 million income tax savings to the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The IRS issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Mr. McDonough will continue to be employed by the Company as an Executive Advisor until December 31, 2009, will receive an annual base salary of $100,000, will continue to vest in his Analog equity awards, and will continue to be eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans until he reaches the age of 65. Mr. McDonough will no longer be an executive officer or eligible to participate in our Executive Bonus or Employee Profit Sharing Plan.
2009 Executive Bonus Plan
On December 3, 2008, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the terms of the 2009 Executive Bonus Plan. All executive officers (including our Named Executive Officers) and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the 2009 Executive Bonus Plan. Bonus payments under the 2009 Executive Bonus Plan are calculated and paid as follows:
The Compensation Committee adopted the following Bonus Payout Factor table under the 2009 Executive Bonus Plan:
The Bonus Payout Factor is determined quarterly and is also used to determine the bonuses paid to all other employees of the Company under our 2009 Profit Sharing Plan for Employees.
The product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2009 Bonus Target by the Bonus Payout Factor shall be the Fiscal 2009 Bonus Payment for each participant. Each participant's Fiscal 2009 Bonus Payment can therefore be reduced to zero, or increased by up to three times his or her Fiscal 2009 Bonus Target.

The terms of the 2009 Executive Bonus Plan are identical to the 2008 Executive Bonus Plan.

EXHIBIT 3.1
Last updated  December 3, 2008
 
     1.1. Annual Meeting. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of shareholders at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and stated in the notice of the meeting. The purposes for which the annual meeting is to be held, in addition to those prescribed by the Articles of Organization, shall be for electing Directors and for such other purposes as shall be specified in the notice for the meeting, and only business within such purposes may be conducted at the meeting. In the event an annual meeting is not held at the time fixed in accordance with these Bylaws or the time for an annual meeting is not fixed in accordance with these Bylaws to be held within 13 months after the last annual meeting, the Corporation may designate a special meeting as a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting, and such meeting shall have all of the effect of an annual meeting.
     1.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, and shall be called by the Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the Secretary, by another officer, if the holders of at least 80 percent, or such lesser percentage as shall constitute the maximum percentage permitted by law for this purpose at any time at which the Corporation shall have a class of voting stock registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary one or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held. Such demands must include all the information that would be required pursuant to Section 1.9 of these Bylaws in the event of an election of directors or Section 1.10 of these Bylaws in the event of any other business. Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice may be conducted at a special shareholders' meeting.
     1.3. Place of Meetings. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation unless a different place is fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and specified in the notice of the meeting.
     1.4. Requirement of Notice. A written notice of the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders' meeting describing the purposes of the meeting shall be given to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting (and, to the extent required by law or the Articles of Organization, to shareholders not entitled to vote at the meeting) no fewer than seven nor more than 60 days before the meeting date. If an annual or special meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed, however, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under this Section 1.4 to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. All notices to shareholders shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws.
     1.5. Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive any notice required by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing, be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the
 
Corporation for inclusion with the records of the meeting. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting: (a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.
     1.6. Quorum.
     (a) Unless otherwise provided by law, or in the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring satisfaction of a greater quorum requirement for any voting group, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. As used in these Bylaws, a voting group includes all shares of one or more classes or series that, under the Articles of Organization or the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as in effect from time to time (the "MBCA"), are entitled to vote and to be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders.
     (b) A share once represented for any purpose at a meeting is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless (1) the shareholder attends solely to object to lack of notice, defective notice or the conduct of the meeting on other grounds and does not vote the shares or otherwise consent that they are to be deemed present, or (2) in the case of an adjournment, a new record date is or shall be set for that adjourned meeting.
     1.7. Voting and Proxies.
     (a) Except as provided in this Section 1.7(a) or unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders' meeting. Only shares are entitled to vote, and each fractional share, if any, is entitled to a proportional vote. Absent special circumstances, the shares of the Corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by another entity of which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting interests; provided, however, that nothing in these Bylaws shall limit the power of the Corporation to vote any shares held by it, directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary capacity. Unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after notice of redemption is given to the holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price upon surrender of the shares.
     (b) A shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment form, an appointment is valid for a period of 11 months from the date the shareholder signed the form or, if it is undated, from the date of its receipt by the officer or agent. An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it
 
is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, as defined in the MBCA. An appointment made irrevocable is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy shall not affect the right of the Corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment. A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he or she did not know of its existence when he or she acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.24 of the MBCA, or any successor Section thereto, and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.
     1.8. Action at Meeting. If a quorum of a voting group exists, favorable action on a matter, other than the election of a member of the Board of Directors, is taken by a voting group if the votes cast within the group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by law, the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring receipt of a greater affirmative vote of the shareholders, including more separate voting groups. Other than in a Contested Election Meeting (as defined below), when a quorum is present, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast "for" such nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee's election (with "abstentions," "broker non-votes" and "withheld votes" not counted as a vote "for" or "against" such election). In a Contested Election Meeting, when a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at such Contested Election Meeting. A meeting of shareholders shall be a "Contested Election Meeting" if there are more persons nominated for election as directors at such meeting than there are directors to be elected at such meeting, determined as of the tenth day preceding the date of the corporation's first notice to shareholders of such meeting sent pursuant to Section 1.4 of these Bylaws (the "Determination Date"); provided, however, that if in accordance with Section 1.9(b) of these Bylaws, shareholders are entitled to nominate persons for election as director for a period of time that ends after the otherwise applicable Determination Date, the Determination Date shall instead be as of the end of such period. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a shareholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
     1.9. Nomination of Directors.
     (a) Except for (1) any Directors entitled to be elected by the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, (2) any Directors elected by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 2.3 of these Bylaws to fill vacancies or newly created directorships or (3) as otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange regulation, at any meeting of shareholders, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures in this Section 1.9 shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nomination for election to the Board of Directors at a meeting of shareholders may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (x) timely complies with the notice procedures in Section 1.9(b), (y) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of such notice and on the record
 
date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (z) is entitled to vote at such meeting.
     (b) To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received in writing by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation as follows: (i) in the case of an election of Directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and (B) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; or (ii) in the case of an election of Directors at a special meeting of shareholders, provided that the Board of Directors has determined that Directors shall be elected at such meeting, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting and (y) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a shareholders' meeting (or the public announcement thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice.
     The shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (A) as to each proposed nominee (1) such person's name, age, business address and, if known, residence address, (2) such person's principal occupation or employment, (3) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, beneficially owned by such person, (4) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among () the shareholder, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made and the respective affiliates and associates of, or others acting in concert with, such shareholder and such beneficial owner, on the one hand, and () each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert with such nominee, on the other hand, including all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the shareholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith were the "registrant" for purposes of such Item and the proposed nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant, and (5) any other information concerning such person that must be disclosed as to nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and (B) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned, beneficially and of record, by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding between such shareholder and/or such beneficial owner and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made or who

Not later than 10 days after the record date of the meeting, the information required by Items (A)(1)-(5) and (B)(1)-(5) of the prior sentence shall be supplemented by the shareholder providing updated information as of the record date. In addition, to be effective, the shareholder's notice must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a Director if elected. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation or whether such nominee would be independent under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission and stock exchange rules and the Corporation's publicly disclosed Corporate Governance Guidelines. A shareholder shall not have complied with this Section 1.9 if the shareholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made) solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9.
     (c) The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9 (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in compliance with the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9), and if the chairman should determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting.
     (d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.9 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include in any notice of meeting, proxy statement or other shareholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect to any nominee for Director submitted by a shareholder.
 
     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.9, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the meeting of shareholders to present a nomination, such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nominee may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.9, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 1.9, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     (a) At any meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting of shareholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10; provided that nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or any successor Rule. A shareholder (or beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made) shall not have complied with this Section 1.10 if the shareholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
 
made) solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.10.
     (c) The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether business was properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.10 (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal in compliance with the representation with respect thereto required by this Section 1.10), and if the chairman should determine that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.10, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such business shall not be brought before the meeting.
     (d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.10 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include in its notice of meeting, proxy statement or other shareholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect to any proposal submitted by a shareholder.
     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of shareholders to present business, such business shall not be considered, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such proposal may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as a proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 1.10, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     1.11. Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate, including without limitation such guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of shareholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders, their duly
 
authorized and constituted proxies or attorneys or such other persons as shall be determined; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
     1.12. Action Without Meeting by Written Consent.
     (a) Action taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents that describe the action taken, are signed by shareholders having the requisite votes, bear the date of the signatures of such shareholders, and are delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with the records of meetings within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this Section 1.12. A consent signed under this Section 1.12 has the effect of a vote at a meeting.
     (b) If action is to be taken pursuant to the consent of voting shareholders without a meeting, the Corporation, at least seven days before the action pursuant to the consent is taken, shall give notice, which complies in form with the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws, of the action to nonvoting shareholders in any case where such notice would be required by law if the action were to be taken pursuant to a vote by voting shareholders at a meeting. The notice shall contain, or be accompanied by, the same material that would have been required by law to be sent to shareholders in or with the notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for approval.
     1.13. Record Date. The Board of Directors may fix the record date in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action. If a record date for a specific action is not fixed by the Board of Directors, and is not supplied by law, the record date shall be (a) the close of business either on the day before the first notice is sent to shareholders, or, if no notice is sent, on the day before the meeting or (b) in the case of action without a meeting by written consent, the date the first shareholder signs the consent or (c) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting of shareholders, the date the first shareholder signs the demand or (d) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares, the date the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution. A record date fixed under this Section 1.13 may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
     1.14. Meetings by Remote Communication. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Organization, if authorized by the Board of Directors: subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may, by means of remote communication: (a) participate in a meeting of
 
shareholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of shareholders, provided that: (1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxyholder; (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (3) if any shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.
     1.15. Form of Shareholder Action.
     (a) Any vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder shall be considered given in writing, dated and signed, if, in lieu of any other means permitted by law, it consists of an electronic transmission that sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (1) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder, proxy or agent or by a person authorized to act for the shareholder, proxy or agent; and (2) the date on which such shareholder, proxy, agent or authorized person transmitted the electronic transmission. The date on which the electronic transmission is transmitted shall be considered to be the date on which it was signed. The electronic transmission shall be considered received by the Corporation if it has been sent to any address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of shareholders.
     (b) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any purpose for which the original writing could be used, but the copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.
     1.16. Shareholder List for Meeting.
     (a) After fixing a record date for a shareholders' meeting, the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder, but need not include an electronic mail address or other electronic contact information for any shareholder.
     (b) The list of shareholders shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice is given of the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting: (1) at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held; or (2) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting.
 
     (c) A shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of Section 6.2(c) of these Bylaws, to copy the list, during regular business hours and at his or her expense, during the period it is available for inspection. (d) The Corporation shall make the list of shareholders available at the meeting, and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.
     2.1. Powers. All corporate power shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of, its Board of Directors.
     2.2. Number and Election. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than the minimum number of individuals permitted by law and, subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, shall be divided into three classes, such classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, at each annual meeting of shareholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected. Subject to the foregoing requirements and applicable law, the Board of Directors may, from time to time, fix the number of Directors and their respective classifications, provided that any such action does not operate to remove a Director elected by the shareholders or the Directors other than in the manner specified in the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws.
     2.3. Vacancies. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, vacancies and newly created directorships, whether resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a Director or otherwise, shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new Director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.
     2.4. Change in Size of Board of Directors. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the number of Directors may be fixed or changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
     2.5. Tenure. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, each Director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting at which such Director was elected; provided, however, that each Director designated as a Class I Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2005; each Director designated as a Class II Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2006; and each Director designated as a Class III Director as of the effective date of these amended and restated Bylaws shall serve for an initial term expiring at the
 
Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held in 2007; and provided further, however, that the term of each Director shall continue until the election and qualification of a successor and be subject to such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the vacancy occurred or the new directorship was created and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.
     2.6. Resignation. A Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice of resignation to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date.
     2.7. Removal. A Director may be removed from office (a) with or without cause by vote of a majority of the stockholders entitled to vote in the election of Directors, provided that the Directors of a class elected by a particular class of stockholders may be removed only by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or (b) for cause by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office. A Director may be removed for cause only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove him. To the extent that any of the provisions in this Section 2.7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any of the provisions of Section 8.06 of the MBCA, as amended from time to time, the provisions of Section 8.06 shall govern and control.
     2.8. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such times and places as shall from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting. A regular meeting may be held without a call or notice at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, following such meeting of shareholders.
     2.9. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, any two Directors or one Director in the event that there is only one Director.
     2.10. Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors must be preceded by at least two days' notice of the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special meeting. All notices to Directors shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws.
     2.11. Waiver of Notice. A Director may waive any notice before or after the date and time of the meeting. The waiver shall be in writing, signed by the Director entitled to the notice, or in the form of an electronic transmission by the Director to the Corporation, and filed with the minutes or corporate records. A Director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
 
     2.12. Quorum. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws, a quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a majority of the Directors then in office, provided always that any number of Directors (whether one or more and whether or not constituting a quorum) constituting a majority of Directors present at any meeting or at any adjourned meeting may make an adjournment thereof.
     2.13. Action at Meeting. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of the Board of Directors unless the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of Directors. A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors when corporate action is taken is considered to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he or she objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (b) his or her dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) he or she delivers written notice of his or her dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a Director who votes in favor of the action taken.
     2.14. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by the unanimous consent of the members of the Board of Directors. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action taken, in writing, signed by each Director, or delivered to the Corporation by electronic transmission, to the address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of Directors, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 2.14 is effective when the last Director signs or delivers the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. A consent signed or delivered under this Section 2.14 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.
     2.15. Telephone Conference Meetings. The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to be present in person at the meeting.
     2.16. Committees. The Board of Directors may create one or more committees and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them. Each committee may have one or more members, who serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The creation of a committee and appointment of members to it must be approved by a majority of all the Directors in office when the action is taken. Article III and Sections 2.10 through 2.15 of these Bylaws shall apply to committees and their members. To the extent specified by the Board of Directors, each committee may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors to the extent permitted by law. The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a Director with the standards of conduct described in Section 2.18 of these Bylaws.
 
     2.17. Compensation. The Board of Directors may fix the compensation of Directors.
     2.18. Standard of Conduct for Directors.
     (a) A Director shall discharge his or her duties as a Director, including his or her duties as a member of a committee: (1) in good faith; (2) with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation. In determining what the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, a Director may consider the interests of the Corporation's employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state, the region and the nation, community and societal considerations, and the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation.
     (b) In discharging his or her duties, a Director who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent with respect to the information, opinions, reports or statements presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons retained by the Corporation, as to matters involving skills or expertise the Director reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular person's professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person merits confidence; or (3) a committee of the Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.
     (c) A Director is not liable for any action taken as a Director, or any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or her office in compliance with this Section 2.18.
     2.19. Conflict of Interest.
     (a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the Corporation in which a Director of the Corporation has a material direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the Corporation solely because of the Director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:
     (1) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;
     (2) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or
     (3) the transaction was fair to the Corporation.
     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.19, and without limiting the interests that may create conflict of interest transactions, a Director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a
 
transaction if: (1) another entity in which he or she has a material financial interest or in which he or she is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or (2) another entity of which he or she is a director, officer or trustee or in which he or she holds another position is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board of Directors.
     (c) For purposes of clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors on the Board of Directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Section 2.19 by a single Director. If a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.
     (d) For purposes of clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection (d). Shares owned by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in clause (1) of subsection (b) of this Section 2.19, may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19. The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other provisions of these Bylaws. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19.
All notices provided for under these Bylaws shall conform to the following requirements:
     (a) Notice shall be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice by electronic transmission is written notice.
     (b) Notice may be communicated in person; by telephone, voice mail, telegraph, teletype or other electronic means; by mail; by electronic transmission; or by messenger or delivery service. If these forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published; or by radio, television or other form of public broadcast communication.
     (c) Written notice, other than notice by electronic transmission, if in a comprehensible form, is effective upon deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to the addressee's address shown in the Corporation's current records.
 
     (d) Written notice by electronic transmission, if in comprehensible form, is effective: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the addressee of such specific posting, directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the addressee in such manner as the addressee shall have specified to the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     (e) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this Article III, written notice, other than notice by electronic transmission, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following: (1) when received; (2) five days after its deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; (3) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; or if sent by messenger or delivery service, on the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (4) on the date of publication if notice by publication is permitted.
     (f) Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.
     4.1. Enumeration. The Corporation shall have a President, a Treasurer, a Secretary and such other officers as may be appointed by the Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with these Bylaws, including, but not limited to, a Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer and one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Treasurers and Assistant Secretaries.
     4.2. Appointment. The officers shall be appointed by the Board of Directors. A duly appointed officer may appoint one or more officers or assistant officers if authorized by the Board of Directors. Each officer has the authority and shall perform the duties set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with these Bylaws, the duties prescribed by the Board of Directors or by direction of an officer authorized by the Board of Directors to prescribe the duties of other officers. The appointment of an officer shall not itself create contract rights.
     4.3. Qualification. The same individual may simultaneously hold more than one office in the Corporation. No officer need be a shareholder.
     4.4. Tenure. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is duly appointed, unless a different term is specified in the vote appointing him or her, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
 
     4.5. Resignation. An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice of the resignation to the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. If a resignation is made effective at a later date and the Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board of Directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board of Directors provides that the successor shall not take office until the effective date. An officer's resignation shall not affect the Corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer.
     4.6. Removal. The Board of Directors may remove any officer at any time with or without cause. An officer's removal shall not affect the officer's contract rights, if any, with the Corporation.
     4.7. Vacancies. The Board of Directors may fill any vacancy occurring in any office for any reason and may, in its discretion, leave unfilled for such period as it may determine any offices other than those of President, Treasurer and Secretary. Each such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor and until his or her successor is duly appointed, or until he or she sooner dies, resigns or is removed.
     4.8. Chairman of the Board and Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors may appoint from its members a Chairman of the Board, who need not be an employee or officer of the Corporation. If the Board of Directors appoints a Chairman of the Board, he or she shall perform such duties and possess such powers as are assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors and, if the Chairman of the Board is also designated as the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, shall have the powers and duties of the Chief Executive Officer prescribed in Section 4.9 of these Bylaws. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders.
     If the Board of Directors appoints a Vice Chairman of the Board, he or she shall, in the event of the absence, inability or refusal to act of the Chairman of the Board, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Chairman of the Board and shall perform such other duties and possess such other powers as may from time to time be vested in him or her by the Board of Directors.
     4.9. President; Chief Executive Officer. Unless the Board of Directors has designated the Chairman of the Board or another person as Chief Executive Officer, the President shall be the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer shall have general charge and supervision of the business of the Corporation, subject to the direction of the Board of Directors. The President shall perform such other duties and shall have such other powers as the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer (if the President is not the Chief Executive Officer) may from time to time prescribe. In the event of the absence, inability or refusal to act of the Chief Executive Officer or the President (if the President is not the Chief Executive Officer), the Vice President (or, if there shall be more than one, the Vice Presidents in the order determined by the Board of Directors) shall perform the duties of the Chief Executive Officer and, when so performing such duties, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon, the Chief Executive Officer.
 
     4.10. Vice Presidents. Any Vice President shall perform such duties and shall possess such powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President may from time to time prescribe. The Board of Directors may assign to any Vice President the title Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President or any other title selected by the Board of Directors.
     4.11. Treasurer and Assistant Treasurers. The Treasurer shall perform such duties and shall have such powers as may from time to time be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. In addition, the Treasurer shall perform such duties and have such powers as are incident to the office of treasurer, including without limitation the duty and power to keep and be responsible for all funds and securities of the Corporation, to deposit funds of the Corporation in depositories, to disburse such funds as ordered by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, to make proper accounts of such funds, and to render as required by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President statements of all such transactions and of the financial condition of the Corporation.
   Any Assistant Treasurer shall perform such duties and possess such powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Treasurer may from time to time prescribe. In the event of the absence, inability or refusal to act of the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer (or if there shall be more than one, the Assistant Treasurers in the order determined by the Board of Directors) shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Treasurer.
     4.12. Secretary and Assistant Secretaries. The Secretary shall perform such duties and shall possess such powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President may from time to time prescribe. In addition, the Secretary shall perform such duties and shall have such powers as are incident to the office of the secretary, including without limitation the duty and power to give notices of all meetings of shareholders and Directors, to attend all meetings of shareholders and Directors, to prepare minutes of the meetings of shareholders and Directors, to authenticate the records of the Corporation, to maintain a stock ledger and prepare lists of shareholders and their addresses as required, to be custodian of corporate records and the corporate seal and to affix and attest to the same on documents.
          Any Assistant Secretary shall perform such duties and possess such powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary may from time to time prescribe. In the event of the absence, inability or refusal to act of the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary (or if there shall be more than one, the Assistant Secretaries in the order determined by the Board of Directors) shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Secretary.
     In the absence of the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary at any meeting of shareholders or Directors, the person presiding at the meeting shall designate a temporary secretary to prepare the minutes of the meeting.
     4.13. Salaries. Officers of the Corporation shall be entitled to such salaries, compensation or reimbursement as shall be fixed or allowed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 
     4.14. Standard of Conduct for Officers. An officer shall discharge his or her duties: (a) in good faith; (b) with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably exercise under similar circumstances; and (c) in a manner the officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation. In discharging his or her duties, an officer who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent with respect to the information, opinions, reports or statements presented; or (2) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons retained by the Corporation as to matters involving skills or expertise the officer reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular person's professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person merits confidence. An officer shall not be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for any decision to take or not to take any action taken, or any failure to take any action, as an officer, if the duties of the officer are performed in compliance with this Section 4.14.
     5.1. Issuance and Consideration. The Board of Directors may issue the number of shares of each class or series authorized by the Articles of Organization. The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the Corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the Corporation. Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. The Board of Directors shall determine the terms upon which the rights, options or warrants for the purchase of shares or other securities of the Corporation are issued and the terms, including the consideration, for which the shares or other securities are to be issued.
     5.2. Share Certificates. If shares are represented by certificates, at a minimum each share certificate shall state on its face: (a) the name of the Corporation and that it is organized under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (b) the name of the person to whom issued; and (c) the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents. Every certificate for shares of stock that are subject to any restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of such shares pursuant to the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws, an agreement among shareholders or an agreement among shareholders and the Corporation, shall have conspicuously noted on the front or back of such certificate the existence of such restrictions. If different classes of shares or different series within a class are authorized, then the variations in rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class and series, and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine variations for any future class or series, must be summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back that the Corporation will furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge. Each share certificate shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or any
 
two officers designated by the Board of Directors, and may bear the corporate seal or its facsimile. If the person who signed, either manually or in facsimile, a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate shall be nevertheless valid.
     5.3. Uncertificated Shares. The Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporation's classes or series without certificates. The authorization shall not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required by the MBCA to be on certificates.
     5.4. Transfers; Record and Beneficial Owners. Subject to the restrictions, if any, stated or noted on the stock certificates, shares of stock may be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of attorney properly executed, and with such proof of authority or the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the record holder of shares as shown on its books as the owner of such shares for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and other distributions and the right to vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other disposition of such shares until the shares have been transferred on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the requirements of these Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Board of Directors has established a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee will be recognized by the Corporation as a shareholder, the Corporation shall be entitled to treat the beneficial owner of shares as the shareholder to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with the Corporation.
     5.5. Replacement of Certificates. The Board of Directors may, subject to applicable law, determine the conditions upon which a new share certificate may be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of such share certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give a bond, sufficient in its opinion, with or without surety, to indemnify the Corporation against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issue of the new certificate.
     6.1. Records to be Kept.
     (a) The Corporation shall keep as permanent records minutes of all meetings of its shareholders and Board of Directors, a record of all actions taken by the shareholders or Board of Directors without a meeting, and a record of all actions taken by a committee of the Board of Directors in place of the Board of Directors on behalf of the Corporation. The Corporation shall maintain appropriate accounting records. The Corporation or its agent shall maintain a record of its shareholders, in a form that permits preparation of a list of the names and addresses of all shareholders, in alphabetical order by class of shares showing the number and class of shares
 
held by each. The Corporation shall maintain its records in written form or in another form capable of conversion into written form within a reasonable time.
     (b) The Corporation shall keep within The Commonwealth of Massachusetts a copy of the following records at its principal office or an office of its transfer agent or of its Secretary or Assistant Secretary or of its registered agent:

Deferred Compensation Plan Amendment
On December 3, 2008, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009. Our directors and senior level employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan was amended primarily to bring it into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to permit a special 2008 transition distribution election as permitted by IRS Notice 2007-86, issued in connection with Section 409A.
The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
Amendment to Employee Retention Agreements
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has also approved an amendment to our outstanding Employee Retention Agreements, as required to bring them into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.
We enter into Employee Retention Agreements with each of our executive officers (including our Named Executive Officers) and other key employees providing for severance benefits in the event of termination within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in each agreement) that was approved by the Board of Directors. The Employee Retention Agreements also provide for severance benefits if (1) we terminate the employee (other than termination for "cause"), or (2) the employee terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in each agreement) within 24 months after a change in control (as defined in each agreement) that was approved by the Board of Directors. The Employee Retention Agreements also provide for severance benefits if an employee is terminated (other than for "cause") within 12 months after a change in control that was not approved by the Board of Directors. The Employee Retention Agreements do not provide for severance benefits in the event of an employee's death or disability. They provide for the following severance benefits: (1) a lump-sum payment equal to 200% (299% in the case of executive officers) of the sum of the employee's annual base salary plus the total cash bonuses paid or awarded to him or her in the four fiscal quarters preceding his or her termination, and (2) the continuation of life, disability, dental, accident and group health insurance benefits for a period of 24 months.
The foregoing description of the Employee Retention Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Employee Retention Agreement, as amended, incorporated by reference in this Report, and the Form of Amendment to Employee Retention Agreement, filed as Exhibit 10.3 of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.

Elections with respect to such payment made under the Plan prior to the effective date of this amendment and restatement shall continue in effect unless changed in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI and the Administrative Procedures.
Upon a Change in Control or upon a Participant's separation from service for reasons other than death, Disability, or Retirement, the Employer shall pay to the Participant, subject to Section 6.5, a Deferral Benefit in a lump sum equal to the vested balance of his or her Account determined pursuant to Article V, less applicable withholdings, as soon as administratively practicable, but in any event within 60 days of such event.

Such distribution shall consist of an amount necessary to meet the emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution but not exceeding the aggregate balance of such Participant's Deferral Account as of the date of such payment. The determination of whether a distribution may be approved on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be made after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. The amount of the Deferral Benefit otherwise payable under the Plan to such Participant shall be adjusted to reflect the early payment of the Unforeseeable Emergency. Any distribution under this Section 6.3 shall be made only in the manner and to the extent that it is in compliance with Section 409A.

6.9 Special 2005 Distribution and Election Changes
To the extent and in the manner permitted under Section 409A, and at the election of any Participant, the following distributions and election changes have been permitted, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures:

Each Participant shall have the sole right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as his or her Beneficiary to whom payment under the Plan shall be made in the event of his or her death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of his or her Account(s). All Beneficiary designations must be made in the manner required by the Committee or the Recordkeeper. Any
 
designation of a Beneficiary in effect under the Plan prior to this amendment and restatement shall continue in full force and effect unless changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan.
     
7.2 Change of Beneficiary Designation.
Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant by making a new Beneficiary designation in the manner required by the Committee or the Recordkeeper, which will supersede all Beneficiary designations previously filed. The designation of a Beneficiary may be made or changed at any time without the consent of any other person.
     
7.3 No Designation.
If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary shall be the Participant's Beneficiary under the terms of the TIP; provided that the Beneficiary in such circumstances of a non-employee member of the Board, shall be the Participant's estate.
     
7.4 Effect of Payment.
Payment to a Participant's Beneficiary shall completely discharge the Employer's obligations under the Plan. The Beneficiary shall have no right to change or in any way modify the manner in which the Participant's Account is being paid.
     
8.1 Committee.
The Deferred Compensation Plan Committee shall be appointed by the Board and consist of up to three members of the Board who are not Participants in the Plan. The Committee shall have complete discretion to (i) supervise the administration and operation of the Plan, (ii) adopt rules and procedures governing the Plan from time to time, (iii) interpret the Plan terms and determine all questions of fact arising with respect to the Plan terms and any Participant or Beneficiary and (iv) adopt and amend, from time to time, the Administrative Procedures.
     
8.2 Agents.
The Committee may appoint an individual, who may be an employee of the Company, to be the Committee's agent with respect to the day-to-day administration of the Plan. In addition, the Committee may, from time to time, employ other agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.
     
8.3 Binding Effect of Decisions.
 
Any decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan shall be final and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.

The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee and their duly appointed agents under Section 8.2 against any and all claims, loss, damage, expense or liability arising from any action or failure to act with respect to the Plan, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
     
9.1 Amendment.
The Board or the Committee, acting on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate shall amend the terms of this Plan from time to time to comply with Section 409A. In addition, the Board or the Committee may, on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate, amend, suspend or reinstate any or all of the provisions of the Plan, including, without limitation, reduce or eliminate employer contributions or Participant deferrals under the Plan; provided that any such amendment, suspension or reinstatement which is inconsistent with Section 409A shall be ineffective to the extent inconsistent with Section 409A. No amendment may reduce the value of any Participant's Account at the end of the calendar year prior to the date such amendment is adopted, except to the extent required for conformance with Section 409A.
     
9.2 Termination.
The Board or the Committee, acting on behalf of the Company and of each Selected Affiliate, may terminate this Plan at any time and for any reason whatsoever to the extent permitted by Section 409A. If the Plan is terminated under the provisions of this Section 9.2 all vested Accounts shall be distributed in a lump sum to the Participants or in such other manner as is permitted under Section 409A. A termination of the Plan shall not reduce the value of a Participant's Account, as it existed as of the day before the effective date of such termination except to the extent distributed to the Participant or a Beneficiary.
     
10.1 Funding.
Participants, their Beneficiaries, and their heirs, successors and assigns, shall have no secured interest or claim in any property or assets of the Employer. The Employer's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Employer to pay money in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has a related so-called Rabbi Trust' to hold funds which it intends to use in payment of the obligations of Employers under the Plan.
 
In the event of a Change in Control or prior thereto, the Employers shall maintain and fund such trust, only to the extent consistent with Section 409A, and in particular Section 409A(b), in an amount equal to not less than the total value of the Participants' Accounts under the Plan as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the Change in Control; provided that any funds contained therein shall be liable for the claims of the respective Employer's general creditors as provided therein.
     
10.2 Nonassignability.
No right or interest under the Plan of a Participant or his or her Beneficiary (or any person claiming through or under any of them) shall be assignable or transferable in any manner or be subject to alienation, anticipation, sale, pledge, encumbrance or other legal process or in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any such Participant or Beneficiary. If any Participant or Beneficiary shall attempt to or shall transfer, assign, alienate, anticipate, sell, pledge or otherwise encumber his or her benefits hereunder or any part thereof, or if by reason of his or her bankruptcy or other event happening at any time such benefits would devolve upon anyone else or would not be enjoyed by him or her, then the Committee acting, in its discretion only, may terminate his or her interest in any such benefit (including the Deferral Account) to the extent the Committee considers such action necessary or advisable to prevent or limit the effects of such occurrence. Termination shall be effected by filing a written "termination declaration" with the Clerk of the Company and making reasonable efforts to deliver a copy to the Participant or Beneficiary whose interest is adversely affected (the "terminated participant").
As long as the terminated participant is alive, any benefits affected by the termination shall be retained by the Employer and, in the Committee's sole and absolute judgment, may be paid to or expended for the benefit of the terminated participant, his or her spouse, his or her children or any other person or persons in fact dependent upon him or her in such a manner as the Committee shall deem proper; provided that no such action shall result in any acceleration or deferral of the payment of the Participant's Account. Upon the death of the terminated participant, all benefits withheld from him or her and not paid to others in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be disposed of according to the provisions of the Plan that would apply if he or she died prior to the time that all benefits to which he or she was entitled were paid to him or her. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may only exercise the discretion provided for in this paragraph and make any payments for or with respect to a terminated participant to the extent and in the manner they determine that such action is permitted under Section 409A.
     
10.3 Legal Fees and Expenses.
If, after a Change in Control, (1) an Eligible Employee initiates or is required to defend against a claim in court concerning the benefits intended to be provided to such Eligible Employee under the Plan (the "Claim"); and (2) the Eligible Employee prevails on the Claim, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to attorneys' fees and other costs of the litigation. Such expenses and other fees shall (i) be paid through the end of such litigation or until the Statute of Limitations with respect to such claim is reached, whichever is later, (ii) be reimbursed on or before the last day of the Eligible Employee's taxable year following the taxable year in which incurred, (iii) not

10.4 Captions.
The captions contained herein are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction hereof.
     
10.5 Governing Law.

The Employee hereby irrevocably submits to and acknowledges and recognizes the jurisdiction of a federal court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to conflict of law provisions, or if jurisdiction is not appropriate in a federal court located in Massachusetts, then a state court within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (which courts, for purposes of this Agreement, are the only courts of competent jurisdiction) over any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter.
     
10.6 Successors.
The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Company, its Selected Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns. The term successors as used herein shall include any corporate or other business entity which shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, acquire all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Company or a Selected Affiliate and successors of any such Company or other business entity.

     Amendment dated as of , 2008 ("Amendment") to the Employee Retention Agreement (the "Retention Agreement") between Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") and (the "Employee").
                    
                    
                    
                    
     WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Retention Agreement to reflect changes required by final regulations issued under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
     NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
1. Section 5(c)(i) of the Retention Agreement is amended to delete the provisions of clause (B) so that it shall read in its entirety as follows:
"(i) the Company shall pay to you your full base salary and all other compensation through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time the Notice of Termination is given, no later than the full fifth day following the Date of Termination, plus all other amounts to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company at the time such payments are due under the terms of such plan;"
2. Section 5(d) of the Retention Agreement is amended by the addition of the following clause at the end thereof:
", but in no event later than the end of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the additional Excise Tax (and interest or penalties) are remitted to the applicable taxing authority."
3. The last sentence of Section 5(e) of the Retention Agreement is restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall be payable on the fifth day after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code)."
4. The following new Section 7 shall be added to the Retention Agreement (and the remaining sections shall be renumbered accordingly):

Compliance with Code Section 409A
 
Company shall have no right to accelerate any payment or provision of any benefits under this Agreement or to make or provide any such payment or benefits if such payment or provision of such benefits would, as a result, be subject to tax under Section 409A of the Code. You and the Company agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement and to take such reasonable steps as necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to you under Section 409A.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if you are determined to be a "Specified Employee" (as defined below) at the time of your termination, to the extent this Agreement provides for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, such benefits shall not be paid to you prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your termination of employment; or (ii) the date of your death.

5. Except as amended hereby and set forth above, the Retention Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment to Executive Retention Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Updates Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2009
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 20, 2009--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today updated its outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, ending January 31, 2009.
Revenue for the first quarter is expected to decline by approximately 25% to 30% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, due to additional weakness in end demand and inventory reductions across the supply chain as a result of continued deterioration of global economic conditions. At the mid-point of this revised revenue outlook, ADI expects diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to be approximately $0.15 to $0.17, excluding restructuring charges, which the company is unable to determine at this time. ADIs previously announced outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 provided on November 24, 2008, included an expected sequential revenue decline of approximately 20% and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.22 to $0.23, excluding restructuring charges.
The company will not hold a conference call in conjunction with todays release, and as previously scheduled, will announce financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 on Wednesday, February 18, 2009 after market close.

Gross margin was 56.4% of revenue
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.08, which includes a $0.10 per share impact from restructuring

Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended January 31, 2009. Revenue for the first quarter was $477 million, operating income was $20 million, and diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.08. These financial results include restructuring charges of $42 million, or $0.10 per share.
During the first quarter, we reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 13% sequentially and constrained inventory growth as deteriorating economic conditions continued to pressure end-market demand, said President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman. In addition to executing immediate cost actions, we continued to drive the process we began long before the downturn to heighten our focus on market opportunities that offer attractive growth and profitability, and to streamline our manufacturing operations.
Mr. Fishman continued, Were further concentrating our investments on core technologies that have enabled us to build the strongest signal processing brand in the industry. At the same time, were driving initiatives to fundamentally reshape our infrastructure costs which, along with further spending reductions, are designed to maximize our near- and long-term profitability.

End market and product revenue highlights:
54% of total revenue, decreased 24% from the immediately prior quarter and 22% from the same period one year ago. The economic slowdown impacted spending across our broad-base of industrial customers, albeit to varying degrees. As expected, revenue from automotive customers showed the largest quarter-to-quarter decrease as a result of general weakness in the global automotive sector. Most other industrial application areas declined to a lesser extent than the automotive sector.
- Revenue from industrial customers,
- 27% of total revenue, decreased 22% from the immediately prior quarter and 3% from the same period one year ago. Revenue from wireless handset customers experienced the largest sequential and year-over-year percentage declines. Revenue from basestation customers declined sequentially, but increased on a year-over-year basis.
Revenue from communications customers,
- 16% of total revenue, decreased 42% sequentially and 40% year-to-year, with revenues declining across all consumer electronics applications, consistent with the global decline in consumer spending.
Revenue from consumer customers,
- 3% of total revenue, decreased 38% from the immediately prior quarter and 35% from the same quarter a year ago, in line with the worldwide decline in PC sales.
Revenue from computer customers,
- 91% of total revenue, declined 27% from the immediately prior quarter and 21% year-over-year. Together, data converters and amplifiers contributed 74% of total revenue for the quarter.
Analog product revenue,
- , 8% of total revenue, decreased 34% sequentially and 27% year-over-year.

Outlook: Second Quarter of Fiscal 2009
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the revenue outlook for the company for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Mr. Fishman stated, Orders through December remained weak, but began to stabilize in January and early February. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter, as measured by end customer bookings, was approximately 0.9. At this point in the cycle, given our short lead times and the continuing economic uncertainty, we are receiving a significant portion of new orders as turns orders rather than as longer-term backlog. Therefore, we continue to have limited visibility for the next few months. As a result, we estimate that revenue for the second quarter will decline by 5% to 15% compared to the first quarter.
Mr. Fishman continued, Maximizing current and future profitability, while positioning ourselves to capitalize on the opportunities that will emerge when the downturn reverses, warrants us taking additional steps in the second quarter to permanently reduce spending. First, as previously disclosed, we are concluding the consolidation of our 6-inch and 8-inch fabs in Ireland. We are also accelerating our plans to consolidate our two remaining U.S. fabs. In addition, we anticipate recording a restructuring charge in the second quarter which has not been precisely determined as of yet.
As a result of the impact of restructuring actions and further spending reductions, we expect second quarter operating expenses to decrease by an additional 3% to 4% sequentially. Combined with significant cost reductions in the first quarter, operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be down 16% to 17% on a cumulative basis from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Assuming this level of cost reduction, we anticipate that at the mid-point of our fiscal second quarter revenue guidance, our gross margin will be approximately 53% to 54%, as we further lower manufacturing output and factory utilization below first quarter levels in line with our inventory management plans; and diluted EPS from continuing operations will be approximately $0.08 to $0.09, excluding restructuring charges.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the first fiscal quarters results and the short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at , today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. A table reconciling the Companys non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is provided in this release.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating income, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following item is also excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, retroactive to January 1, 2008. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $3 million income tax savings to the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

of common stock
ADIs second quarter results were better than planned as we benefited from increased sales to communications infrastructure and consumer customers and a general abatement of inventory reductions by our customers. In addition, our second quarter expenses were significantly lower than originally planned as we aggressively reduced spending in response to ongoing economic uncertainty, said President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman. Despite the challenging environment, our business model continues to allow us to generate solid profits and cash flow as it has done for many years, giving us the flexibility to execute the strategic investment and cost reduction initiatives that we expect will drive significant operating leverage when demand recovers.
Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2009
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Mr. Fishman stated, Orders to ADI and our distributors recovered significantly in the second quarter, as customer inventory reductions subsided. Our book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter, as measured by end customer bookings, was slightly above one for the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and our third quarter opening backlog was up from last quarter. In addition, order levels were stable throughout the second quarter and have remained at these levels through the first two weeks of May. Nevertheless, our lead times remain short and we are still receiving a significant portion of new orders as turns orders, thereby limiting visibility.
Mr. Fishman continued, Given these factors, were planning for our third quarter revenue to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. We plan to continue to reduce inventories in the third quarter, and to keep very tight control over operating expenses. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 54% to 55%, depending on end market revenue mix and factory utilization, and are planning for operating expenses to remain approximately flat sequentially. In addition, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, we are planning for diluted EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET

Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

          (b) . Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs a Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, an ""), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act, other Federal or state statutory law or regulation or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement, any Statutory Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, litigation, investigation or proceeding whatsoever (whether or not such Underwriter Indemnified Party is a party thereto), whether threatened or commenced, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter

Underwriter Indemnified Party
 
consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting", the second sentence in the sixth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting", and the information contained in the twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting".
          (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

Actions against Parties; Notification
          (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
Contribution
 
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(d).
          9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities hereunder on the Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date, the Representative may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters
          10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Re:
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel for Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of $375,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Notes due 2014 (the "Debt Securities"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities, LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement. The Debt Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of June 30, 2009 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture to be dated as of June 30, 2009 (the "Indenture").
     As such counsel, we have assisted in the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") of the Company's prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated June 25, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus"), each relating to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-160215) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Commission on June 25, 2009.
     We have examined and relied upon corporate or other proceedings of the Company regarding (i) the authorization of the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance of the Debt Securities, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the Base Prospectus, (iv) the Prospectus Supplement, (v) the Underwriting Agreement and (vi) the Indenture. We have also examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, such other agreements and instruments, certificates of public officials, officers of the Company and other persons, and such other documents, instruments and certificates as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
     In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individual signatories, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of such original documents, and the completeness and accuracy of the corporate records of the Company provided to us by the Company.
 
Analog Devices, Inc. June 25, 2009 Page 2
     In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, (ii) the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, and (iii) the Trustee shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. We have also assumed the due authentication of the Debt Securities by the Trustee, that there will not have occurred, prior to the date of issuance of the Debt Securities, any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of such Debt Securities and that at the time of the issuance and sale of the Debt Securities, the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof acting pursuant to authority properly delegated to such committee by the Board of Directors) has not taken any action to rescind or otherwise reduce its prior authorization of the issuance of the Debt Securities.
     We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the state laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America.
     We have assumed for purposes of our opinions below that no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Indenture or the Debt Securities or, if any such authorization, approval, consent, action, notice or filing is required, it will have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and will be in full force and effect.
     Our opinions below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, usury, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally, (ii) duties and standards imposed on creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of materiality, good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and (iii) general equitable principles. Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the availability of any equitable or specific remedy upon any breach of the Indenture or the Debt Securities, or to the successful assertion of any equitable defenses, inasmuch as the availability of such remedies or the success of any equitable defenses may be subject to the discretion of a court. We also express no opinion herein with respect to compliance by the Company with the securities or "blue sky" laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States or of any foreign jurisdiction. In addition, we express no opinion and make no statement herein with respect to the antifraud laws of any jurisdiction.
     On the basis of, and subject to, the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when the Debt Securities have been duly executed by the Company, and duly authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the consideration therefor duly approved by the Company, and subject to the final
 
Analog Devices, Inc. June 25, 2009 Page 3
terms of the Debt Securities complying with then applicable law, not resulting in a default under or a breach of any agreement or instrument binding upon the Company and complying with any requirement or restriction imposed by any court or governmental entity having jurisdiction over the Company, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Please note that we are opining only as to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion should be inferred as to any other matters. This opinion is based upon currently existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions and is rendered as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of the foregoing sources of law or subsequent developments in law or changes in facts or circumstances that might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed on or about June 30, 2009, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and to the use of our name therein and in the related Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving such consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission.

of common stock
ADI had a solid third quarter, delivering sequential sales growth of 4% with the largest increases in the automotive and consumer end markets. During the quarter, we also saw order rates from industrial customers begin to improve as inventory reductions subsided, said President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman. Importantly, we reduced costs for the third consecutive quarter, resulting in a cumulative decline in operating expenses of well over 20% since the end of fiscal 2008. By driving continued competitive advantage through innovation while remaining focused on expense management, were positioning ADI to achieve solid revenue growth and operating leverage as demand improves.
Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2009
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Mr. Fishman stated, There are near-term indications that business conditions are improving. Order rates strengthened throughout the third quarter and have remained strong during the first two weeks of August. Our book-to-bill ratio for the third quarter, as measured by end customer bookings, was above one, and our fourth quarter opening backlog was up from last quarter.
Mr. Fishman continued, Given these factors, we expect that our revenue will grow to approximately $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. While we plan to continue to tightly manage inventory levels, we expect a small increase in utilization, which should result in a gross margin in the fourth quarter of approximately 55.0%. In addition, we plan to continue to closely manage operating expenses and expect them to increase slightly by approximately 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to increase again to approximately $0.24 to $0.26 in the fourth quarter.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the third fiscal quarters results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 23056388, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating income, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2010
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Mr. Fishman stated, During the fourth quarter of 2009, order rates from end customers accelerated significantly, growing by approximately 17% sequentially, and as a result, our first quarter opening backlog grew substantially from last quarter. We believe that the atypically strong growth in Q4 was the result of gradual improvements in many economies; customer inventory replenishment; and the benefits ADI is beginning to see from its rich new product cycle as a result of more focused investments over the past few years.
Mr. Fishman continued, We expect that our industrial revenue will continue to grow sequentially in the first quarter in line with higher manufacturing activity worldwide and our higher opening backlog. For the first quarter, we are expecting automotive and communications sales to be relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. In addition, we are planning for consumer sales to decrease in Q1, given the large sequential revenue increases in Q4, which may not repeat in Q1, and also typical seasonal patterns. As a result, we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be approximately flat to fourth quarter levels, and up 20% from the same period last year. Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter to increase to approximately 58.0% to 58.5%, as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a richer mix of industrial sales. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter to remain approximately flat to fourth quarter levels, in line with our plan to achieve higher operating leverage going forward. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to be approximately $0.36 to $0.37 in the first quarter, excluding restructuring charges associated with the closure of our Cambridge fab.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 results, and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 28835578, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses and our non-GAAP operating income:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, retroactive to January 1, 2008. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $3 million income tax savings to the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated With Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
2006 Stock Incentive Plan: Standard Version (U.S.) Division: ABC Division Location: Norwood, MA
We are pleased to advise the Participant that Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") on the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Award"). This Award reflects the Company's confidence in the Participant's commitment and contributions to the success and continued growth of the Company.
     1. . This memorandum confirms that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Analog Devices, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company has granted to the Participant (the "Participant"), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below, that number of RSUs set forth below:
Restricted Stock Unit
Each one (1) RSU shall, if and when it vests in accordance with this Award, automatically convert into one (1) share of common stock, US$0.16 2/3 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock") issuable as provided below. The RSUs are subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 2, the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 and the right of the Company to retain Shares (as defined below) pursuant to Section 7.
     2. .
Vesting and Conversion
          (a) Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Award, the RSUs shall vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 1. For purposes of this Award, RSUs that have not vested as of any particular time in accordance with this Section 2(a) are referred to as "Unvested RSUs." The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon the vesting and conversion of the RSUs are referred to in this Award as "Shares." As soon as administratively practicable after the issuance of any Shares upon the vesting and conversion of RSUs, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered evidence (which may include a book entry by the Company's transfer agent) of the Shares so issued in the name of the Participant to the brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain the brokerage account established for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to or in the name of the Participant upon the vesting and conversion of any RSUs unless the issuance of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
          (b) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or Disability or as otherwise provided in the Plan or below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested RSUs as of the date of termination shall terminate and be cancelled immediately and automatically and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested RSUs. For purposes of the foregoing, the date of termination shall mean the earliest of (i)
 
the date on which notice of termination is provided by the Company to the Participant, (ii) the last day of the Participant's active service with the Company, or (iii) the last day on which the Participant is an employee of the Company, as determined in each case without including any required advance notice period and irrespective of the status of the termination under local labor or employment laws.
          (c) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested RSUs shall vest in full as of the date of the Participant's death.
          (d) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company terminates by reason of Disability (as defined below), the Unvested RSUs as of the date of the Participant's termination shall vest in full as of the date of the termination. For the purpose of this Award, "Disability" means (i) the Participant's inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as determined by the Company.
          (e) For purposes of this Award, employment with the Company shall include employment with any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company or any such parent or subsidiary of the Company.
     3. .
Restrictions on Transfer
          (a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any RSUs, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
          (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
     4. . The RSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares upon vesting and conversion of the RSUs, and until vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Participant shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall have no right to receive any dividends and shall have no voting rights with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs for which the record date is on or before the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are issued to the Participant.
Not a Shareholder
     5. . The RSUs and Shares, including the grant and issuance thereof, are subject to the provisions of the Plan. A copy of the Plan prospectus is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, HR, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column).
Provisions of the Plan
     6. . Any Shares that are issued and any cash payment that is delivered, in either case upon settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award, will be in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient.
Consideration
     7. .
Withholding Taxes
     (a) Regardless of any action the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility, and that the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
     (b) Prior to the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs, if any taxing jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient number of whole Shares otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined under the Plan) sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares. The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, with no withholding in Shares. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, no Shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting this grant of RSUs, the Participant expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the Participant's sole responsibility.
     8. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award and except where otherwise prohibited under local law or where cash settlement may present adverse tax consequences to the Participant, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein.
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
     9. . The Company hereby notifies the Participant of the following in relation to the Participant's personal data and the collection, processing and transfer of such data in relation to the grant of the RSUs and the Participant's participation in the Plan, pursuant to applicable personal data protection laws. The collection, processing and transfer of the Participant's personal data is necessary for the Company's administration of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Participant's denial and/or objection to the collection, processing and transfer of personal data may affect the Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. As such, the Participant voluntarily acknowledges, consents and agrees (where required under applicable law) to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described herein.

The Data may be provided by the Participant or collected, where lawful, from third parties, and the Company will process the Data for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan.

may be located in the United States, the European Economic Area, or elsewhere throughout the world. The Participant hereby authorizes (where required under applicable law) the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant's behalf to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan.
     The Participant may, at any time, exercise the Participant's rights provided under applicable personal data protection laws, which may include the right to (a) obtain confirmation as to the existence of the Data, (b) verify the content, origin and accuracy of the Data, (c) request the integration, update, amendment, deletion, or blockage (for breach of applicable laws) of the Data, and (d) to oppose, for legal reasons, the collection, processing or transfer of the Data which is not necessary or required for the implementation, administration and/or operation of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan.

In addition, the Participant also agrees to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, as may be required to allow the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant. Finally, the Participant agrees to take any and all actions as may be required to comply with the Participant's personal legal and tax obligations under all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant.
Repatriation; Compliance with Laws
     11. .
Miscellaneous
          (a) . The grant of the RSUs shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company nor limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the RSUs hereunder).
No Rights to Employment
          (b) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of the RSUs under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of RSUs or any other award under the Plan or other benefits in lieu thereof in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of any grant, the number of Shares subject to the grant, and the vesting provisions. Any amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of the Participant's employment with the Company.
Discretionary Nature
          (c) . The Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary. The value of the RSUs and any other awards granted under the Plan is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of the Participant's employment with the Company (and the Participant's employment contract, if any). Any grant under the Plan, including the grant of the RSUs, is not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension, or retirement benefits or similar payments.
Exclusion from Termination Indemnities and Other Benefits
          (d) . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Award shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Award, and each other provision of this Award shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
Severability
 
          (e) . Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Award may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Waiver

Amendment

Exhibit 10.2
2006 Stock Incentive Plan: Standard Version Division: ABC Division Location: Norwood, MA
We are pleased to advise the Participant that Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") on the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Award"). This Award reflects the Company's confidence in the Participant's commitment and contributions to the success and continued growth of the Company.
     1. . This memorandum confirms that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Analog Devices, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company has granted to the Participant (the "Participant"), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below, that number of RSUs set forth below:
Restricted Stock Unit
Each one (1) RSU shall, if and when it vests in accordance with this Award, automatically convert into one (1) share of common stock, US$0.16 2/3 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock") issuable as provided below. The RSUs are subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 2, the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 and the right of the Company to retain Shares (as defined below) pursuant to Section 7.
     2. .
Vesting and Conversion
          (a) Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Award, the RSUs shall vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 1. For purposes of this Award, RSUs that have not vested as of any particular time in accordance with this Section 2(a) are referred to as "Unvested RSUs." The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon the vesting and conversion of the RSUs are referred to in this Award as "Shares." As soon as administratively practicable after the issuance of any Shares upon the vesting and conversion of RSUs, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered evidence (which may include a book entry by the Company's transfer agent) of the Shares so issued in the name of the Participant to the brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain the brokerage account established for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to or in the name of the Participant upon the vesting and conversion of any RSUs unless the issuance of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
          (b) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or disability or as otherwise in the Plan or below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested RSUs as of the date of termination shall terminate and
 
be cancelled immediately and automatically and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested RSUs. For purposes of the foregoing, the date of termination shall mean the earliest of (i) the date on which notice of termination is provided by the Company to the Participant, (ii) the last day of the Participant's active service with the Company, or (iii) the last day on which the Participant is an employee of the Company, as determined in each case without including any required advance notice period and irrespective of the status of the termination under local labor or employment laws.
          (c) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested RSUs shall vest in full as of the date of the Participant's death.
          (d) In the event the Participant's employment terminates by reason of a disability (as determined by the Company in accordance with local law), the Unvested RSUs as of the date of the Participant's disability shall vest in full as of the date of such disability.
          (e) For purposes of this Award, employment with the Company shall include employment with any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company or any such parent or subsidiary of the Company.
     3. .
Restrictions on Transfer
          (a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any RSUs, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
          (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
     4. . The RSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares upon vesting and conversion of the RSUs, and until vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Participant shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall have no right to receive any dividends and shall have no voting rights with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs for which the record date is on or before the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are issued to the Participant.
Not a Shareholder
     5. . The RSUs and Shares, including the grant and issuance thereof, are subject to the provisions of the Plan. A copy of the Plan prospectus is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, HR, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column).
Provisions of the Plan
     6. . Any Shares that are issued and any cash payment that is delivered, in either case upon settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award, will be in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient.
Consideration
     7. .
Withholding Taxes
     (a) Regardless of any action the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility, and that the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
     (b) Prior to the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs, if any taxing jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient number of whole Shares otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined under the Plan) sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares. The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, with no withholding in Shares. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, no Shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting this grant of RSUs, the Participant expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the Participant's sole responsibility.
     8. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award and except where otherwise prohibited under local law or where cash settlement may present adverse tax consequences to the Participant, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein.
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
     9. . The Company hereby notifies the Participant of the following in relation to the Participant's personal data and the collection, processing and transfer of such data in relation to the grant of the RSUs and the Participant's participation in the Plan, pursuant to applicable personal data protection laws. The collection, processing and transfer of the Participant's personal data is necessary for the Company's administration of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Participant's denial and/or objection to the collection, processing and transfer of personal data may affect the Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. As such, the Participant voluntarily acknowledges, consents and agrees (where required under applicable law) to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described herein.

The Data will be accessible within the Company's organization only by those persons requiring access for purposes of the implementation, administration and operation of the Plan and for the Participant's participation in the Plan.
     The Company will transfer Data as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Company may further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. These recipients may be located in the European Economic Area, the United States or elsewhere throughout the world. The
 
Participant hereby authorizes (where required under applicable law) the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant's behalf to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan.
     The Participant may, at any time, exercise the Participant's rights provided under applicable personal data protection laws, which may include the right to (a) obtain confirmation as to the existence of the Data, (b) verify the content, origin and accuracy of the Data, (c) request the integration, update, amendment, deletion, or blockage (for breach of applicable laws) of the Data, and (d) to oppose, for legal reasons, the collection, processing or transfer of the Data which is not necessary or required for the implementation, administration and/or operation of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan. The Participant may seek to exercise these rights by contacting the Participant's local HR manager.
     10. .

In addition, the Participant also agrees to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, as may be required to allow the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant.

Miscellaneous
          (a) . The grant of the RSUs shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company nor limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the RSUs hereunder).
No Rights to Employment
          (b) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officer
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement
On January 14, 2010, Analog Devices, Inc. ("Analog") and Jerald G. Fishman entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement which amends Mr. Fishman's current Employment Agreement dated November 14, 2005 (the "2005 Employment Agreement") and extends the period of Mr. Fishman's employment to the end of fiscal 2012 (the "Employment Period").
Pursuant to the amended Employment Agreement, Mr. Fishman's base salary of $930,935 and his annual bonus target percentage under the Analog executive bonus plan of 160% of his annual base salary remain unchanged from the 2005 Employment Agreement. Analog's executive bonus plan for each fiscal year is subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee. The specific metrics applicable to the calculation of Mr. Fishman's annual bonus are established by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, and may vary from year to year. In addition to his base salary and annual bonus, Mr. Fishman continues to be eligible to receive an additional annual bonus consistent with his current agreement.
Under the amended Employment Agreement, Analog has granted Mr. Fishman an award of 160,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) pursuant to Analog's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. These RSUs vest in a single installment on the earlier of January 15, 2013 or a change in control of Analog, except as provided below. Mr. Fishman did not receive any equity awards in 2008 or 2009, and Analog expects this equity grant will be the only equity award made to Mr. Fishman during the remaining three years of the amended Employment Agreement.
Pursuant to the existing terms of the Executive Retention Agreement dated October 23, 2007 between Analog and Mr. Fishman (the "2007 Retention Agreement"), if Mr. Fishman is still employed by Analog on November 14, 2010 (or earlier under certain circumstances), Mr. Fishman's account in Analog's Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") will be credited with an amount equal to the aggregate retention bonuses earned by him under such Agreement. This compensation is not payable to Mr. Fishman until the later of six months after termination of employment or the first day of the fiscal year after termination of employment. Because Mr. Fishman's Employment Period has been extended, Mr. Fishman's access to these amounts will continue to be deferred beyond the originally planned payment date. Accordingly, the amended Employment Agreement provides that after November 14, 2010, Analog will credit to Mr. Fishman's DCP account as additional earnings thereon the difference, if any, between (a) the amount actually earned on Mr. Fishman's DCP account allocated to a money market account and (b) the amount that would have been earned thereon at the mid-term applicable federal rate in effect at the beginning of the applicable year. The mid-term applicable federal rate is currently 2.45%. Commencing with fiscal 2011, Mr. Fishman's additional annual bonus will no longer be deferred but will instead be paid to Mr. Fishman semi-annually, consistent with Analog's bonus plan for all employees.
If, prior to the end of the Employment Period, Mr. Fishman's employment with Analog is terminated by Analog without "Cause" (as defined in the amended Employment Agreement) or by Mr. Fishman for "Good Reason" (as defined in the amended Employment Agreement), then Mr. Fishman shall receive:
 
For up to 12 months following termination of Mr. Fishman's employment under certain circumstances, at the request of Analog, Mr. Fishman shall, for no additional consideration, perform up to two days of consulting services per week. Also, Mr. Fishman will not compete with Analog during the employment period and for two years following termination of employment.
In connection with the amended Employment Agreement, Analog and Mr. Fishman amended the 2007 Retention Agreement to eliminate the provision under which Analog had previously agreed to indemnify Mr. Fishman for any excess parachute payment tax payable in connection with a change in control of Analog.
The foregoing descriptions of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement and the Amendment to the 2007 Retention Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Amendment to Long-Term Retention Agreement and Amended and Restated Employment Agreement incorporated by reference in this Report, and filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.

With or Without Cause
 
Corporation with Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means (i) the willful and continued failure of Executive to perform substantially his duties with the Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Executive by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive's duties, (ii) the willful engaging by Executive in gross and reckless negligence which materially and adversely affects the Corporation's business; (iii) Executive's willful engaging in conduct that is materially injurious to the Corporation; (iv) Executive's conviction (by a court of competent jurisdiction, not subject to further appeal) of, or pleading guilty to, a felony, or (v) a material breach of any of Executive's obligations not to compete with the Corporation or to maintain the confidentiality of its confidential and proprietary information.
     For purpose of this Section 4.2, no act or failure to act by Executive shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by Executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation. Cause shall not exist unless and until (a) in the event of any Cause defined and clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) above, a written notice has been provided to the Executive by the Board specifically identifying the Cause that is the basis for the Board's determination and Executive has failed to cure or remedy the action or omission so identified within a period of 30 days after Executive's receipt of such notice (unless the action or omission is of a nature that it cannot be cured or remedied), and (b) the Corporation has delivered to Executive, along with the Notice of Termination for Cause, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board (excluding Executive if Executive is a Board member) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board an event set forth in clauses (i) to (v) above has occurred and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. If the Board does not notify Executive that any occurrence or event shall constitute "Cause" within sixty (60) days following the Board's first knowledge of such occurrence or event, such occurrence or event shall not constitute Cause under this Agreement. Any events, facts or circumstances known to the Board that have occurred prior to the Effective Date, and any consequences thereof (whether before or after the Effective Date), shall not constitute "Cause" under this Agreement.
     4.3. . Executive's employment may be terminated by Executive with or without Good Reason. The Employment Period shall immediately end upon a termination by Executive with or without Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means:
With or Without Good Reason
          (i) (a) the assignment to Executive of any duties inconsistent in any material respect with his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or any other action by the Corporation that results in a material diminution in his authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied by the Corporation properly after receipt of notice thereof given by Executive to the Board, or (b) a material and adverse change in Executive's title or office (including his position as President and Chief Executive Officer) with the Corporation;
 
          (ii) any failure by the Corporation to comply in any material respect with any of the provisions of Section 3 of this Agreement;
          (iii) the Corporation requiring Executive to be based at any office or location more than 50 miles from Norwood, Massachusetts, or requiring Executive to travel in the performance of his duties significantly more extensively than the customary travel requirements of Executive as of the Effective Date;
          (iv) any purported termination by the Corporation of Executive's employment otherwise then as permitted by this Agreement, it being understood that such purported termination shall not be effective for any purpose of this Agreement; or
          (v) any failure by the Corporation to comply with and satisfy Section 9.3 of this Agreement, including the failure of any successor to the Corporation to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement with Executive, to the full extent set forth in said Section 9.3;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination by Executive with Good Reason shall be effective only if, within 30 days following the delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason by Executive to the Corporation, the Corporation has failed to cure the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason to the reasonable satisfaction of Executive.
     4.4. . Executive's employment shall terminate upon the expiration of the Employment Period.
Expiration of the Employment Period
     4.5. . Any termination by the Corporation with or without Cause or by Executive with or without Good Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto, given in accordance with Section 10.5 of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the termination date is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the proposed termination date.

Section 409A
               (a) Subject to this Section 10.7, payments or benefits under Section 5 shall begin only upon the date of the Executive's "separation from service" (determined as set forth below) which occurs on or after the termination of the Executive's employment. It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided or referenced under Sections 3.9 and 5 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A.

               (b) If, as of the date of the Executive's "separation from service" from the Corporation, the Executive is not a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then each installment of the payments and benefits shall be made on the dates and terms set forth in this Agreement (or other applicable agreement).

                    (1) Each installment of the payments and benefits due under this Agreement (and other applicable agreements) that, in accordance with the dates and terms set forth therein, will in all circumstances, regardless of when the separation from service occurs, be paid within the period of time permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be treated as a short-term deferral within the meaning of such Section to the maximum extent possible;

Provisions of the Plan

Consideration
 
employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient.
     7. .
Withholding Taxes
     (a) Regardless of any action the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility, and that the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 3(b) of the Participant's Long-Term Retention Agreement with the Company, dated October 22, 2007 shall remain in full force and effect.
     (b) Prior to the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs, if any taxing jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient number of whole Shares otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined under the Plan) sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares. The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, with no withholding in Shares. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, no Shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting this grant of RSUs, the Participant expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the Participant's sole responsibility.
     8. . It is intended that this Award shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the code as a "short-term deferral" under Treas. Reg. Sect. 1.409A-1(b)(4), and all provisions of this Confirming Memorandum shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intention.
Section 409A of the Code
     9. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award and except where otherwise prohibited under local law or where cash settlement may present adverse tax consequences to the Participant, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein.

In addition, the Participant also agrees to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, as may be required to allow the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officer.
The information set forth in Item 5.03 is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation of Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On January 27, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Analog Devices, Inc. ("Analog" or the "Company") amended Analog's Amended and Restated By-laws to remove the provisions related to board classification in connection with the Board's decision to opt-out of Section 8.06(b) of Massachusetts General Laws. ch. 156D, effective immediately. On the same day, in connection with this declassification of the Board, and in compliance with Massachusetts law, Messrs. Champy, Doyle, Istel, Novich, Severino, Sicchitano and Stata resigned from the Board and were re-elected to the Board by the remaining Board members. The Board also re-elected these directors to the committees on which they served immediately prior to their resignation. As a result of these actions, the terms of all classes of directors will expire at the 2010 annual meeting and, starting with that meeting, directors will be elected to serve for a one-year term.
Analog's amended By-laws provide that each director elected will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified. Prior to this amendment, the By-laws provided for a classified board with directors elected for staggered three-year terms (Section 2.5, Tenure). The amended By-laws also remove other references to a classified board (Section 2.2, Number and Election) and conform the provision on board vacancies to relevant state law for declassified boards (Section 2.3, Vacancies). The foregoing description of these amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated By-laws attached as Exhibit 3.1 of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.

     1.1. Annual Meeting. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of shareholders at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and stated in the notice of the meeting. The purposes for which the annual meeting is to be held, in addition to those prescribed by the Articles of Organization, shall be for electing Directors and for such other purposes as shall be specified in the notice for the meeting, and only business within such purposes may be conducted at the meeting. In the event an annual meeting is not held at the time fixed in accordance with these Bylaws or the time for an annual meeting is not fixed in accordance with these Bylaws to be held within 13 months after the last annual meeting, the Corporation may designate a special meeting as a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting, and such meeting shall have all of the effect of an annual meeting.
     1.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, and shall be called by the Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the Secretary, by another officer, if the holders of at least 80 percent, or such lesser percentage as shall constitute the maximum percentage permitted by law for this purpose at any time at which the Corporation shall have a class of voting stock registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary one or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held. Such demands must include all the information that would be required pursuant to Section 1.9 of these Bylaws in the event of an election of directors or Section 1.10 of these Bylaws in the event of any other business. Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice may be conducted at a special shareholders' meeting.
     1.3. Place of Meetings. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation unless a different place is fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and specified in the notice of the meeting.
     1.4. Requirement of Notice. A written notice of the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders' meeting describing the purposes of the meeting shall be given to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting (and, to the extent required by law or the Articles of Organization, to shareholders not entitled to vote at the meeting) no fewer than seven nor more than 60 days before the meeting date. If an annual or special meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed, however, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under this Section 1.4 to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. All notices to shareholders shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws.
     1.5. Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive any notice required by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing, be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with the records of the meeting. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting:
 
(a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.
     1.6. Quorum.
     (a) Unless otherwise provided by law, or in the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring satisfaction of a greater quorum requirement for any voting group, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. As used in these Bylaws, a voting group includes all shares of one or more classes or series that, under the Articles of Organization or the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as in effect from time to time (the "MBCA"), are entitled to vote and to be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders.
     (b) A share once represented for any purpose at a meeting is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless (1) the shareholder attends solely to object to lack of notice, defective notice or the conduct of the meeting on other grounds and does not vote the shares or otherwise consent that they are to be deemed present, or (2) in the case of an adjournment, a new record date is or shall be set for that adjourned meeting.
     1.7. Voting and Proxies.
     (a) Except as provided in this Section 1.7(a) or unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders' meeting. Only shares are entitled to vote, and each fractional share, if any, is entitled to a proportional vote. Absent special circumstances, the shares of the Corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by another entity of which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting interests; provided, however, that nothing in these Bylaws shall limit the power of the Corporation to vote any shares held by it, directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary capacity. Unless the Articles of Organization provide otherwise, redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after notice of redemption is given to the holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price upon surrender of the shares.
     (b) A shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment form, an appointment is valid for a period of 11 months from the date the shareholder signed the form or, if it is undated, from the date of its receipt by the officer or agent. An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, as defined in the MBCA. An
 
appointment made irrevocable is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy shall not affect the right of the Corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment. A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he or she did not know of its existence when he or she acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.24 of the MBCA, or any successor Section thereto, and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.
     1.8. Action at Meeting. If a quorum of a voting group exists, favorable action on a matter, other than the election of a member of the Board of Directors, is taken by a voting group if the votes cast within the group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by law, the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws or, to the extent authorized by law, a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring receipt of a greater affirmative vote of the shareholders, including more separate voting groups. Other than in a Contested Election Meeting (as defined below), when a quorum is present, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast "for" such nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee's election (with "abstentions," "broker non-votes" and "withheld votes" not counted as a vote "for" or "against" such election). In a Contested Election Meeting, when a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at such Contested Election Meeting. A meeting of shareholders shall be a "Contested Election Meeting" if there are more persons nominated for election as directors at such meeting than there are directors to be elected at such meeting, determined as of the tenth day preceding the date of the corporation's first notice to shareholders of such meeting sent pursuant to Section 1.4 of these Bylaws (the "Determination Date"); provided, however, that if in accordance with Section 1.9(b) of these Bylaws, shareholders are entitled to nominate persons for election as director for a period of time that ends after the otherwise applicable Determination Date, the Determination Date shall instead be as of the end of such period. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a shareholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
     1.9. Nomination of Directors.
     (a) Except for (1) any Directors entitled to be elected by the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, (2) any Directors elected by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 2.3 of these Bylaws to fill vacancies or newly created directorships or (3) as otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange regulation, at any meeting of shareholders, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures in this Section 1.9 shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nomination for election to the Board of Directors at a meeting of shareholders may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (x) timely complies with the notice procedures in Section 1.9(b), (y) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of such notice and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (z) is entitled to vote at such meeting.
 
     (b) To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received in writing by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation as follows: (i) in the case of an election of Directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and (B) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; or (ii) in the case of an election of Directors at a special meeting of shareholders, provided that the Board of Directors has determined that Directors shall be elected at such meeting, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting and (y) the seventh day following the day on which notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a shareholders' meeting (or the public announcement thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice.
     The shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (A) as to each proposed nominee (1) such person's name, age, business address and, if known, residence address, (2) such person's principal occupation or employment, (3) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, beneficially owned by such person, (4) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among () the shareholder, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made and the respective affiliates and associates of, or others acting in concert with, such shareholder and such beneficial owner, on the one hand, and () each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert with such nominee, on the other hand, including all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the shareholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith were the "registrant" for purposes of such Item and the proposed nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant, and (5) any other information concerning such person that must be disclosed as to nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and (B) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned, beneficially and of record, by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding between such shareholder and/or such beneficial owner and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made or who may participate in the solicitation of proxies in favor of electing such nominee(s), (4) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into by, or on behalf of, such shareholder or such beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to
x
y
 
mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such shareholder or such beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, (5) any other information relating to such shareholder and such beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominee in a contested election (even if an election contest is not involved) pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (6) a representation that such shareholder and/or such beneficial owner intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person(s) named in its notice and (7) a representation whether such shareholder and/or such beneficial owner intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holder of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock reasonably believed by such shareholder or such beneficial owner to be sufficient to elect the nominee (and such representation shall be included in any such proxy statement and form of proxy) and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such nomination (and such representation shall be included in any such solicitation materials). Not later than 10 days after the record date of the meeting, the information required by Items (A)(1)-(5) and (B)(1)-(5) of the prior sentence shall be supplemented by the shareholder providing updated information as of the record date. In addition, to be effective, the shareholder's notice must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a Director if elected. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation or whether such nominee would be independent under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission and stock exchange rules and the Corporation's publicly disclosed Corporate Governance Guidelines. A shareholder shall not have complied with this Section 1.9 if the shareholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made) solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9.
     (c) The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9 (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee in compliance with the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.9), and if the chairman should determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting.
     (d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.9 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include in any notice of meeting, proxy statement or other shareholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect to any nominee for Director submitted by a shareholder.
     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.9, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the meeting of shareholders to present a nomination, such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nominee may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.9, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be
 
authorized by a written instrument executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 1.9, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     (a) At any meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be brought before the meeting in accordance with Section 1.2 or Section 1.9 of these Bylaws.

Not later than 10 days after the record date of the meeting, the information required by Items (A)(3) and (B)(1)-(6) of the prior sentence shall be supplemented by the shareholder providing updated information as of the record date. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting of shareholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10; provided that nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or any successor Rule. A shareholder (or beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made) shall not have complied with this Section 1.10 if the shareholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made) solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.10.
     (c) The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether business was properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.10 (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal in compliance with the representation with respect thereto required by this Section 1.10), and if the chairman should determine that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.10,
 
the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such business shall not be brought before the meeting.
     (d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.10 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include in its notice of meeting, proxy statement or other shareholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect to any proposal submitted by a shareholder.
     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, if the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of shareholders to present business, such business shall not be considered, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such proposal may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as a proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 1.10, "public disclosure" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     1.11. Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate, including without limitation such guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of shareholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or attorneys or such other persons as shall be determined; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
     1.12. Action Without Meeting by Written Consent.
     (a) Action taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents that describe the action taken, are signed by shareholders having the
 
requisite votes, bear the date of the signatures of such shareholders, and are delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with the records of meetings within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this Section 1.12. A consent signed under this Section 1.12 has the effect of a vote at a meeting.
     (b) If action is to be taken pursuant to the consent of voting shareholders without a meeting, the Corporation, at least seven days before the action pursuant to the consent is taken, shall give notice, which complies in form with the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws, of the action to nonvoting shareholders in any case where such notice would be required by law if the action were to be taken pursuant to a vote by voting shareholders at a meeting. The notice shall contain, or be accompanied by, the same material that would have been required by law to be sent to shareholders in or with the notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for approval.
     1.13. Record Date. The Board of Directors may fix the record date in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action. If a record date for a specific action is not fixed by the Board of Directors, and is not supplied by law, the record date shall be (a) the close of business either on the day before the first notice is sent to shareholders, or, if no notice is sent, on the day before the meeting or (b) in the case of action without a meeting by written consent, the date the first shareholder signs the consent or (c) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting of shareholders, the date the first shareholder signs the demand or (d) for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares, the date the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution. A record date fixed under this Section 1.13 may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
     1.14. Meetings by Remote Communication. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Organization, if authorized by the Board of Directors: subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may, by means of remote communication: (a) participate in a meeting of shareholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of shareholders, provided that: (1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxyholder; (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (3) if any shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.
     1.15. Form of Shareholder Action.
 
     (a) Any vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder shall be considered given in writing, dated and signed, if, in lieu of any other means permitted by law, it consists of an electronic transmission that sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (1) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder, proxy or agent or by a person authorized to act for the shareholder, proxy or agent; and (2) the date on which such shareholder, proxy, agent or authorized person transmitted the electronic transmission. The date on which the electronic transmission is transmitted shall be considered to be the date on which it was signed. The electronic transmission shall be considered received by the Corporation if it has been sent to any address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of shareholders.
     (b) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any purpose for which the original writing could be used, but the copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.
     1.16. Shareholder List for Meeting.
     (a) After fixing a record date for a shareholders' meeting, the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder, but need not include an electronic mail address or other electronic contact information for any shareholder.
     (b) The list of shareholders shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice is given of the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting: (1) at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held; or (2) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting.
     (c) A shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of Section 6.2(c) of these Bylaws, to copy the list, during regular business hours and at his or her expense, during the period it is available for inspection.
     (d) The Corporation shall make the list of shareholders available at the meeting, and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.
 
     2.1. Powers. All corporate power shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of, its Board of Directors.
     2.2. Number and Election. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than the minimum number of individuals permitted by law. Subject to the foregoing requirements and applicable law, the Board of Directors may, from time to time, fix the number of Directors, provided that any such action does not operate to remove a Director elected by the shareholders or the Directors other than in the manner specified in the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws.
     2.3. Vacancies. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, vacancies and newly created directorships, whether resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a Director or otherwise, may be filled by the shareholders or the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new Director may not take office until the vacancy occursIf the vacant office was held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of shares of that voting group or, unless the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws provide otherwise, the Directors elected by that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy.
.
     2.4. Change in Size of Board of Directors. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the number of Directors may be fixed or changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
     2.5. Tenure. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors, each Director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting following the one at which such Director was elected; provided, however, that the term of each Director shall continue until the election and qualification of a successor and be subject to such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next shareholders' meeting at which Directors are elected and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.
     2.6. Resignation. A Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice of resignation to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date.
     2.7. Removal. A Director may be removed from office (a) with or without cause by vote of a majority of the stockholders entitled to vote in the election of Directors, provided that the Directors of a class elected by a particular class of stockholders may be removed only by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or (b) for cause by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office. A Director may be removed for cause only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove him. To the extent that any of the provisions in this Section 2.7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any of the provisions of Section 8.06 of the MBCA, as amended from time to time, the provisions of Section 8.06 shall govern and control.
 
     2.8. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such times and places as shall from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting. A regular meeting may be held without a call or notice at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, following such meeting of shareholders.
     2.9. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, any two Directors or one Director in the event that there is only one Director.
     2.10. Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors must be preceded by at least two days' notice of the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special meeting. All notices to Directors shall conform to the requirements of Article III of these Bylaws.
     2.11. Waiver of Notice. A Director may waive any notice before or after the date and time of the meeting. The waiver shall be in writing, signed by the Director entitled to the notice, or in the form of an electronic transmission by the Director to the Corporation, and filed with the minutes or corporate records. A Director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
     2.12. Quorum. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws, a quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a majority of the Directors then in office, provided always that any number of Directors (whether one or more and whether or not constituting a quorum) constituting a majority of Directors present at any meeting or at any adjourned meeting may make an adjournment thereof.
     2.13. Action at Meeting. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of the Board of Directors unless the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of Directors. A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors when corporate action is taken is considered to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he or she objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (b) his or her dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) he or she delivers written notice of his or her dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a Director who votes in favor of the action taken.
     2.14. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by the unanimous consent of the members of the Board of Directors. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action taken, in writing, signed by each Director, or delivered to the Corporation by electronic transmission, to the address specified by the Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or
 
other officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of Directors, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 2.14 is effective when the last Director signs or delivers the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. A consent signed or delivered under this Section 2.14 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.
     2.15. Telephone Conference Meetings. The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to be present in person at the meeting.
     2.16. Committees. The Board of Directors may create one or more committees and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them. Each committee may have one or more members, who serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The creation of a committee and appointment of members to it must be approved by a majority of all the Directors in office when the action is taken. Article III and Sections 2.10 through 2.15 of these Bylaws shall apply to committees and their members. To the extent specified by the Board of Directors, each committee may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors to the extent permitted by law. The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a Director with the standards of conduct described in Section 2.18 of these Bylaws.
     2.17. Compensation. The Board of Directors may fix the compensation of Directors.
     2.18. Standard of Conduct for Directors.
     (a) A Director shall discharge his or her duties as a Director, including his or her duties as a member of a committee: (1) in good faith; (2) with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation. In determining what the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, a Director may consider the interests of the Corporation's employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state, the region and the nation, community and societal considerations, and the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation.
     (b) In discharging his or her duties, a Director who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent with respect to the information, opinions, reports or statements presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons retained by the Corporation, as to matters involving skills or expertise the Director reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular person's professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person merits confidence; or (3) a committee of the Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.
 
     (c) A Director is not liable for any action taken as a Director, or any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or her office in compliance with this Section 2.18.
     2.19. Conflict of Interest.
     (a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the Corporation in which a Director of the Corporation has a material direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the Corporation solely because of the Director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:
     (1) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;
     (2) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or
     (3) the transaction was fair to the Corporation.
     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.19, and without limiting the interests that may create conflict of interest transactions, a Director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if: (1) another entity in which he or she has a material financial interest or in which he or she is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or (2) another entity of which he or she is a director, officer or trustee or in which he or she holds another position is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board of Directors.
     (c) For purposes of clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors on the Board of Directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Section 2.19 by a single Director. If a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under clause (1) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.
     (d) For purposes of clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection (d). Shares owned by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in clause (1) of subsection (b) of this Section 2.19, may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under clause (2) of subsection (a) of this Section 2.19. The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other provisions of these Bylaws. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Section 2.19.
 
All notices provided for under these Bylaws shall conform to the following requirements:
     (a) Notice shall be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice by electronic transmission is written notice.
     (b) Notice may be communicated in person; by telephone, voice mail, telegraph, teletype or other electronic means; by mail; by electronic transmission; or by messenger or delivery service. If these forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published; or by radio, television or other form of public broadcast communication.
     (c) Written notice, other than notice by electronic transmission, if in a comprehensible form, is effective upon deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to the addressee's address shown in the Corporation's current records.
     (d) Written notice by electronic transmission, if in comprehensible form, is effective: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the addressee of such specific posting, directed to an electronic mail address furnished by the addressee for the purpose, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the addressee in such manner as the addressee shall have specified to the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     (e) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this Article III, written notice, other than notice by electronic transmission, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following: (1) when received; (2) five days after its deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; (3) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; or if sent by messenger or delivery service, on the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (4) on the date of publication if notice by publication is permitted.
     (f) Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.
     4.1. Enumeration. The Corporation shall have a President, a Treasurer, a Secretary and such other officers as may be appointed by the Board of Directors from time to time in accordance

The appointment of an officer shall not itself create contract rights.
     4.3. Qualification. The same individual may simultaneously hold more than one office in the Corporation. No officer need be a shareholder.
     4.4. Tenure. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these Bylaws, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is duly appointed, unless a different term is specified in the vote appointing him or her, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
     4.5. Resignation. An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice of the resignation to the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. If a resignation is made effective at a later date and the Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board of Directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board of Directors provides that the successor shall not take office until the effective date. An officer's resignation shall not affect the Corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer.
     4.6. Removal. The Board of Directors may remove any officer at any time with or without cause. An officer's removal shall not affect the officer's contract rights, if any, with the Corporation.

Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders.
     If the Board of Directors appoints a Vice Chairman of the Board, he or she shall, in the event of the absence, inability or refusal to act of the Chairman of the Board, perform the duties

     5.1. Issuance and Consideration. The Board of Directors may issue the number of shares of each class or series authorized by the Articles of Organization. The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the Corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the Corporation. Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. The Board of Directors shall determine the terms upon which the rights, options or warrants for the purchase of shares or other securities of the Corporation are issued and the terms, including the consideration, for which the shares or other securities are to be issued.
     5.2. Share Certificates. If shares are represented by certificates, at a minimum each share certificate shall state on its face: (a) the name of the Corporation and that it is organized under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (b) the name of the person to whom issued; and (c) the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents.
 
Every certificate for shares of stock that are subject to any restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of such shares pursuant to the Articles of Organization, these Bylaws, an agreement among shareholders or an agreement among shareholders and the Corporation, shall have conspicuously noted on the front or back of such certificate the existence of such restrictions. If different classes of shares or different series within a class are authorized, then the variations in rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class and series, and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine variations for any future class or series, must be summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back that the Corporation will furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge. Each share certificate shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or any two officers designated by the Board of Directors, and may bear the corporate seal or its facsimile. If the person who signed, either manually or in facsimile, a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate shall be nevertheless valid.
     5.3. Uncertificated Shares. The Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporation's classes or series without certificates. The authorization shall not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required by the MBCA to be on certificates.
     5.4. Transfers; Record and Beneficial Owners. Subject to the restrictions, if any, stated or noted on the stock certificates, shares of stock may be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of attorney properly executed, and with such proof of authority or the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the record holder of shares as shown on its books as the owner of such shares for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and other distributions and the right to vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other disposition of such shares until the shares have been transferred on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the requirements of these Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Board of Directors has established a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee will be recognized by the Corporation as a shareholder, the Corporation shall be entitled to treat the beneficial owner of shares as the shareholder to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with the Corporation.
     5.5. Replacement of Certificates. The Board of Directors may, subject to applicable law, determine the conditions upon which a new share certificate may be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of such share certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give a bond, sufficient in its opinion, with or without surety, to indemnify the Corporation against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issue of the new certificate.

          (5) all written communications to shareholders generally within the past three years, including the financial statements furnished under Section 16.20 of the MBCA, or any successor Section thereto, for the past three years;
          (6) a list of the names and business addresses of its current Directors and officers; and

     6.2. Inspection of Records by Shareholders.
     (a) A shareholder is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at the office where they are maintained pursuant to Section 6.1(b) of these Bylaws, copies of any of the records of the Corporation described in said Section 6.1(b) if he or she gives the Corporation written notice of his or her demand at least five business days before the date on which he or she wishes to inspect and copy.
 
     (b) A shareholder is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at a reasonable location specified by the Corporation, any of the following records of the Corporation if the shareholder meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this Section 6.2 and gives the Corporation written notice of his or her demand at least five business days before the date on which he or she wishes to inspect and copy:
          (1) excerpts from minutes reflecting action taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, records of any action of a committee of the Board of Directors while acting in place of the Board of Directors on behalf of the Corporation, minutes of any meeting of the shareholders, and records of action taken by the shareholders or Board of Directors without a meeting, to the extent not subject to inspection under subsection (a) of this Section 6.2;
          (2) accounting records of the Corporation, but if the financial statements of the Corporation are audited by a certified public accountant, inspection shall be limited to the financial statements and the supporting schedules reasonably necessary to verify any line item on those statements; and
          (3) the record of shareholders described in Section 6.1(a) of these Bylaws.
     (c) A shareholder may inspect and copy the records described in subsection (b) of this Section 6.2 only if:
          (1) his or her demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose;
          (2) he or she describes with reasonable particularity his or her purpose and the records he or she desires to inspect;

Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2010
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Mr. Fishman stated, Order rates from end customers were strong throughout the first quarter of fiscal 2010, increasing 8% sequentially. As a result, the opening backlog for shipment in the second quarter increased substantially. Based on order rates and customer feedback, we expect revenue from industrial and communications infrastructure customers to grow in the second quarter, and revenue from consumer customers to be approximately flat. As a result we are planning for revenue in the second quarter to increase to $635 million to $650 million. Our plan is for gross margins for the second quarter to increase to 62% to 63% and operating margins to increase to approximately 29% to 31%. This would result in diluted EPS from continuing operations of approximately $0.48 to $0.51 in the second quarter.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the first quarter results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for this quarter and prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Item 5.02.      Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On October 29, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2011 Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "Executive Performance Incentive Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan. Bonus payments under the Executive Performance Incentive Plan are calculated and paid as follows:
Each participant's Fiscal 2011 Bonus Target is obtained by multiplying his or her Base Salary by his or her Individual Target Bonus Percentage:
Each participant's Fiscal 2011 Bonus Target is then multiplied by the Bonus Payout Factor. The Bonus Payout Factor is equal to (A) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's operating profit before tax (OPBT) as a percentage of revenue for the applicable quarter plus (B) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's revenue growth for the applicable quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The calculations of revenue growth and OPBT as a percentage of revenue are adjustable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to take account of special items, including but not limited to: restructuring-related expense, acquisition- or disposition-related items, non-recurring royalty payments or receipts, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. If OPBT is less than 15% of revenue for the applicable quarter, the Bonus Payout Factor shall be zero for that quarter, even if the Company has revenue growth for that quarter. The Bonus Payout Factor can range from 0% to 300%.
The Compensation Committee adopted the following Bonus Payout Factor tables under the 2011 Executive Performance Incentive Plan:
The Bonus Payout Factor is determined quarterly. For example, if OPBT for a quarter is 22.5% of revenue (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 100% for that element) and revenue growth for the quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year was 30% (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 300% for that element), then the Bonus Payout Factor for the quarter would be 200% which is the sum of 50% of the OPBT factor of 100% and 50% of the revenue growth factor of 300%. The Bonus Payout Factor is also used to determine the bonuses paid to all other employees of the Company under the Company's 2011 Performance Incentive Plan for Employees.
 
A participant's bonus for a quarter shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2011 Bonus Target for the quarter by the Bonus Payout Factor for that quarter. Each participant's Fiscal 2011 Bonus Payment can range from zero to three times his or her Fiscal 2011 Bonus Target.
Each participant in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan, other than Ray Stata and Jerald Fishman, is eligible for an additional Individual Payout Factor that can increase the calculated bonus payment by up to 30% based on superior business performance. Evidence of superior business performance will include, but is not limited to, overachievement of revenue and profitability goals, and achievement of non-financial results that contributed positively to the performance of the Company. At the end of fiscal year 2011, the Chief Executive Officer will review and assess the performance of each of the eligible participants with respect to his or her goals, and will provide his recommendations regarding each participant's performance to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will then, in its discretion, determine whether there is superior performance justifying the application of an Individual Payout Factor.

Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2011
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Mr. Fishman stated, Our book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter, as measured by end customer bookings, was below one as customers began to lower their inventories in response to shortened industry lead-times. During the fourth quarter, order patterns at ADI weakened in late August and September, but substantially recovered in October. Overall, customer feedback indicates that end demand remains strong in most end markets. In this environment, we would expect to operate with less backlog and higher turns during the first quarter. We are planning for first quarter revenue to be in the range of $715 million to $740 million, down 4% to 7% sequentially, and up 19% to 23% on a year-to-year basis. This guidance is indicative of typical industrial seasonality coupled with potentially lower consumer demand. In addition, for the first quarter, we are planning for our gross margin to be approximately 66% of sales as we slightly adjust our production levels, for our operating expenses to decline by approximately 2%, and for our operating margin to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5% of sales. As a result, we anticipate that our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter will be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the fourth quarter results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 16695213, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements made by us. Important factors that may affect future operating results include: any faltering in the apparent improvement of economic conditions and financial markets following the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets, erosion of consumer confidence and declines in customer spending, the effects of declines in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products, competitive pricing pressures, unavailability of raw materials or wafer fabrication, assembly and test capacity, any delay or cancellation of significant customer orders, changes in geographic, product or customer mix, inability to license third party intellectual property, inability to meet customer demand, adverse results in litigation matters, and other risk factors described in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Schedule D
Revenue Trends by End Market
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Analog Devices, Fourth Quarter, Fiscal 2010
Schedule E
Revenue Trends by Product Type
The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

Excluding that charge, non-GAAP operating expenses for that period were $203 million. The table reconciling non-GAAP data to the Companys GAAP results is provided in this release on Schedule F. A more complete table covering reconciliations for prior periods is available on the Analog Devices Investor Relations website at investor.analog.com

Inventory
Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2011
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Mr. Fishman stated, Order trends were strong in the first quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio, as measured by end customer bookings, was approximately one and our backlog increased slightly. Importantly, orders from our OEM customers increased above fourth quarter levels. These trends, coupled with input from our largest customers that demand is strong across their end markets, give us confidence that the inventory correction is mostly behind us at ADI. As a result, we are planning for second quarter revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, flat to up 4% sequentially, and up 9% to 14% on a year-to-year basis. We are planning for our gross margin to increase to approximately 66.5% of sales based on our current mix assumptions, and for our operating expenses to grow in the range of 2% to 3% primarily as a result of the annual salary increase which took effect at the beginning of the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we are planning for expenses to grow slower than revenues. On an earnings per share basis, we anticipate that our diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter will be in the range of $0.65 to $0.69.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the first quarter results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 800-642-1687 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 40955094, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating margin:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The Company recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years, which we now believe we can recover; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Indemnified Party
     (b) . Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs a Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, an ""), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act, other Federal or state statutory law or regulation or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement, any Statutory Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the
Indemnification of Company
Underwriter Indemnified Party
 
Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, litigation, investigation or proceeding whatsoever (whether or not such Underwriter Indemnified Party is a party thereto), whether threatened or commenced, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting", the second sentence in the sixth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting", and the information contained in the twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting".
     (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of
Contribution
 
this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(d).
     9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities hereunder on the Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters
     10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 hereof or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of Section 7(c) hereof, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities, and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if any Securities have been purchased hereunder, the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
     11. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to the Representatives at Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010, Attention: IBD Legal, or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062, Attention: General Counsel; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8 will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to such Underwriter.
Notices
     12. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
 
     13. . The Representatives will act for the several Underwriters in connection with this financing, and any action under this Agreement taken by the Representatives will be binding upon all the Underwriters.
Representation of Underwriters
     14. . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.
Counterparts
     15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that:
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship.
         (a) . The Representatives have been retained solely to act as underwriters in connection with the sale of Securities and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Company and the Representatives has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Final Prospectus, irrespective of whether the Representatives have advised or are advising the Company on other matters;
No Other Relationship

Absence of Obligation to Disclose
          (d). The Company waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims it may have against the Representatives for breach of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agrees that the Representatives shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to the Company in respect of such a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of or in right of the Company, including stockholders, employees or creditors of the Company.

Re:
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel for Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of $375,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Notes due 2016 (the "Debt Securities"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of March 30, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement. The Debt Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 30, 2009 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture to be dated as of April 4, 2011 (the "Indenture").
     As such counsel, we have assisted in the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") of the Company's prospectus supplement dated March 30, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated June 25, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus"), each relating to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-160215) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Commission on June 25, 2009.
     We have examined and relied upon corporate or other proceedings of the Company regarding (i) the authorization of the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance of the Debt Securities, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the Base Prospectus, (iv) the Prospectus Supplement, (v) the Underwriting Agreement and (vi) the Indenture. We have also examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, such other agreements and instruments, certificates of public officials, officers of the Company and other persons, and such other documents, instruments and certificates as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
 
Analog Devices, Inc. March 30, 2011 Page 2
     In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individual signatories, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of such original documents, and the completeness and accuracy of the corporate records of the Company provided to us by the Company. Insofar as this opinion relates to factual matters, we have assumed with your permission without independent investigation that the statements of the Company contained in the Registration Statement are true and correct as to all factual matters stated therein.
     In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, (ii) the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, and (iii) the Trustee shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. We have also assumed the due authentication of the Debt Securities by the Trustee, that there will not have occurred, prior to the date of issuance of the Debt Securities, any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of such Debt Securities and that at the time of the issuance and sale of the Debt Securities, the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof acting pursuant to authority properly delegated to such committee by the Board of Directors) has not taken any action to rescind or otherwise reduce its prior authorization of the issuance of the Debt Securities.
     We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the state laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America.
     We have assumed for purposes of our opinions below that no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Indenture or the Debt Securities or, if any such authorization, approval, consent, action, notice or filing is required, it will have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and will be in full force and effect.
     Our opinions below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, usury, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally, (ii) statutory or decisional law concerning recourse by creditors to security in the absence of notice or hearing, (iii) duties and standards imposed on
 
Analog Devices, Inc. March 30, 2011 Page 3
creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of materiality, good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and (iv) general equitable principles. Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the availability of any equitable or specific remedy upon any breach of the Indenture or the Debt Securities, or to the successful assertion of any equitable defenses, inasmuch as the availability of such remedies or the success of any equitable defenses may be subject to the discretion of a court. We also express no opinion herein with respect to compliance by the Company with the securities or "blue sky" laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States or of any foreign jurisdiction. In addition, we express no opinion and make no statement herein with respect to the antifraud laws of any jurisdiction.

Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2011
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Mr. Fishman stated, Overall demand for ADI products was very strong in the second quarter, although it is likely that a portion of the upside above our plan was the result of industry-wide supply uncertainty related to events in Japan which most probably accelerated some demand. We do not expect this to repeat in the third quarter as supply appears to have stabilized across the industry. At the same time, our order trends were strong throughout the second quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio, as measured by end customer bookings, was above one and our OEM opening backlog for shipment in the third quarter increased from the prior quarter, indicating continued growth in demand for our products. In addition, our customer forecasts indicate continued strong demand for industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure products and some recovery in consumer products, particularly in Japan.
The Companys outlook for the third quarter is as follows:
$765 million to $795 million, or down 3% to up 1% sequentially.
Revenue:
67.0% to 68.0% of sales, based on our current mix assumptions.
Gross margin:
: Flat to down 1%.
Operating expenses

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to tax items that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years, which we now believe we can recover; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2011
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 16, 2011--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI):
3Q11 revenue was $758 million
3Q11 gross margin was 67.2% of revenue
3Q11 operating margin was 36.8% of revenue
3Q11 diluted EPS was $0.71
3Q11 cash flow from operations was $257 million, or 34% of revenue
Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share
Financial results and 4Q11 outlook will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm
Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which ended July 30, 2011.
After an unusually robust second quarter in which our revenue grew by 9% sequentially, revenue in the third quarter declined by 4% on a sequential basis while increasing 5% year-over-year, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Nevertheless, most end markets remained relatively stable during the third quarter and we believe that most of the revenue shortfall was the result of supply chain recalibration, not a change in underlying demand.
Mr. Fishman added, Despite lower revenue, our operational execution remained strong in the third quarter as we delivered gross margin of 67.2%, operating margin of 36.8%, diluted EPS of $0.71, and operating cash flow of $257 million, or 34% of sales.
Results of Operations for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2011
was $758 million, a 4% decrease from $791 million in the immediately prior quarter and a 5% increase from $720 million in the same period one year ago. For more information regarding revenue by end market and product type for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, please see Schedules D and E of this document. In addition, a more complete table covering prior periods is available on the Analog Devices Investor Relations website at: investor.analog.com.
Revenue
was 67.2% of revenue, compared to 67.6% of revenue in the immediately prior quarter, and 66.7% of revenue in the same period one year ago.
Gross margin
were$231 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 2%, from the immediately prior quarter, and an increase of $2 million, or 1%, from the same period one year ago.
Operating expenses
was $279 million, or 36.8% of revenue, compared to $299 million, or 37.8% of revenue, in the immediately prior quarter, and $251 million, or 34.9% of revenue, in the same period one year ago.
Operating income
was $0.71 which includes $0.01 associated with a year-to-date tax expense adjustment. This compares to diluted EPS of $0.78 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75, excluding a one-time tax benefit item, in the prior quarter, and diluted EPS of $0.65 in the same period one year ago. The table reconciling non-GAAP data to the Companys GAAP results is provided in this release on Schedule F. A more complete table covering reconciliations for prior periods is available on the Analog Devices Investor Relations website at investor.analog.com.
Diluted earnings per share (EPS)
of $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on September 14, 2011 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 26, 2011.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend
was$257 million, or 34% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $37 million, cash dividends paid were $75 million, and approximately $66 million was used to repurchase 1.7 million shares of ADI stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
Net cash provided by operating activities
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $3.5 billion, compared to $3.4 billion at the end of the immediately prior quarter.
Cash and short-term investments
in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as measured by days sales outstanding, was 45 days, compared to 48 days in the immediately prior quarter
Accounts receivable
.
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased by $6 million, or 2%, compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days in inventory was 110 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to 104 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter.
Inventory
Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2011
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the companys short-term outlook, Mr. Fishman stated, The third quarter results were mostly influenced by what we believe were temporary issues. That being said, we are concerned that growing uncertainty about the global economy could cause our customers to become more cautious in the short term and that could reduce our revenue in the fourth quarter. This is, of course, difficult to precisely forecast. Therefore, our guidance for the fourth quarter has a wider range than is typical for ADI.
Given these factors, ADIs outlook for the fourth quarter is as follows:
$715 million to $755 million, or flat to down 6% sequentially.
Revenue:
65.0% to 66.0% of sales, due to reduced factory loadings.
Gross margin:
: Flat to down 3% sequentially.
Operating expenses
: $0.60 to $0.68.
Diluted EPS
Mr. Fishman concluded, While the significant swings in customer supply chain management in 2011 have caused short-term quarterly variations in our results, we believe the company is performing well against its overall objectives for the fiscal year. At the midpoint of our fourth quarter outlook, we expect that ADI will grow revenue approximately 9% this year to over $3 billion, in line with our long-term model. In addition, we expect fiscal 2011 operating margin to be approximately 36% and operating cash flow to be approximately $900 million.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the third quarter results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On September 13, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2012 Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "Executive Performance Incentive Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer are eligible to participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan. The foregoing description of the Executive Performance Incentive Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2012 Executive Performance Incentive Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
     On September 13, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2012 Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "Executive Performance Incentive Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan. Bonus payments under the Executive Performance Incentive Plan are calculated and paid as follows:
     1. Each participant's Fiscal 2012 Bonus Target is obtained by multiplying his or her Base Salary by his or her Individual Target Bonus Percentage:
     2. Each participant's Fiscal 2012 Bonus Target is then multiplied by the Bonus Payout Factor. The Bonus Payout Factor is equal to (A) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's operating profit before tax (OPBT) as a percentage of revenue for the applicable quarter plus (B) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's revenue growth for the applicable quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The calculations of revenue growth and OPBT as a percentage of revenue are adjustable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to take account of special items, including but not limited to: restructuring-related expense, acquisition- or disposition-related items, non-recurring royalty payments or receipts, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. If OPBT is less than 15% of revenue for the applicable quarter, the Bonus Payout Factor shall be zero for that quarter, even if the Company has revenue growth for that quarter. The Bonus Payout Factor can range from 0% to 300%.
1
     The Compensation Committee adopted the following Bonus Payout Factor tables under the 2012 Executive Performance Incentive Plan:
 
 
     The Bonus Payout Factor is determined quarterly. For example, if OPBT for a quarter is 22.5% of revenue (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 100% for that element) and revenue growth for the quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year was 30% (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 300% for that element), then the Bonus Payout Factor for the quarter would be 200% which is the sum of 50% of the OPBT factor of 100% and 50% of the revenue growth factor of 300%. The Bonus Payout Factor is also used to determine the bonuses paid to all other employees of the Company under the Company's 2012 Bonus Plan for Employees.
     A participant's bonus for a quarter shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2012 Bonus Target for the quarter by the Bonus Payout Factor for that quarter. Each participant's Fiscal 2012 Bonus Payment can range from zero to three times his or her Fiscal 2012 Bonus Target.
     3. Each participant in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan, other than Ray Stata and Jerald Fishman, is eligible for an additional Individual Payout Factor that can increase the calculated bonus payment by up to 30% based on superior business performance, subject to the 300% Bonus Payout Factor cap. Evidence of superior business performance will include, but is not limited to, overachievement of revenue and profitability goals, and achievement of non-financial results that contributed positively to the performance of the Company. At the end of fiscal year 2012, the Chief Executive Officer will review and assess the performance of each of the eligible participants with respect to his or her goals, and will provide his recommendations regarding each participant's performance to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will then, in its discretion, determine whether there is superior performance justifying the application of an Individual Payout Factor.
     4. Fiscal 2012 bonus payments, if any, under the Executive Performance Incentive Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and distributed after the first half and second half of fiscal year 2012. The bonus payment for the first half of Fiscal 2012 will be paid on or before June 30, 2012 and the bonus payment for the second half of Fiscal 2012 will be paid on or before December 31, 2012. In the event that the Compensation Committee determines that a participant should receive an Individual Payout Factor, such amount would be paid to the participant, together with the regular payment, if any, for the second half of fiscal 2012. Therefore, the amount paid after the first half of fiscal year 2012 will be based only on paragraphs 1 and 2 above, while the amount paid after the fiscal year end will be based on paragraphs 1 and 2 above and will also include any amount based on the application of the Individual Payout Factor as described in paragraph 3 above.
 
     5. Executives are eligible for a bonus payment with respect to their first full fiscal quarter of employment, so long as they remain actively employed by the Company on the applicable bonus payment date in June or December. For example, an executive hired during the first quarter would only be eligible for a bonus payment with respect to the second quarter, so long as he or she was still actively employed on the June payment date.

Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 29, 2011.
We are very pleased with our fiscal year 2011 performance as ADI delivered record annual revenue and profitability, with revenue of approximately $3 billion, operating profit of approximately $1.1 billion, or 35.8% of revenue, and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.79. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $778 million, or 26% of revenue, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. In the fourth quarter, our results declined, consistent with a general slowdown in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the industrial and communications markets. Nevertheless, during this period, the consumer end market showed seasonal growth and the automotive sector continued to be strong. During the fourth quarter, we also reduced production levels, which reduced both our internal and channel inventories despite lower revenue, and resulted in lower gross margins. In addition, we took steps to reduce discretionary spending, allowing us to produce strong profitability while continuing to invest in our key strategic programs.
Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2011
was $716 million, a 6% decrease from the immediately prior quarter and a 7% decrease from the same period one year ago.

Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2012
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the companys short-term outlook, Mr. Fishman stated, During the fourth quarter, order rates slowed but appeared to stabilize and our backlog decreased from the prior quarter. We believe that our customers are taking steps to reduce their inventory levels due to the uncertainties in the worldwide economy and we expect this to continue through the first quarter. These inventory reductions, together with what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for ADI, cause us to believe that revenue will decline sequentially in the first quarter. We plan to bring production levels down in the first quarter, consistent with the decline in revenue, which should have a negative impact on gross margin. In response to this drop in revenue and gross margin, we plan to once again manage expenses carefully.
Mr. Fishman continued, Our first quarter will have 14 weeks. However, the shutdowns for Christmas in Europe and North America, and the Lunar New Year in Asia will likely mitigate, or eliminate, the benefit of the extra week of revenue. The net result is likely to be an equivalent of 13 weeks of shipments and 14 weeks of expenses.
As a result of these factors, ADIs outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows:
Down 5% to 10% sequentially.
Revenue:
63.0% plus or minus 50 basis points.
Gross margin:
: $226 million to $229 million.
Operating expenses
: $0.44 to $0.51.
Diluted EPS
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the fourth quarter results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 855-859-2056 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 25055926, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other material cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years, which we now believe we can recover; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Schedule D
Revenue Trends by End Market
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. During fiscal year 2011, the Company consolidated the computer end market, which represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2011 revenue, into the consumer end market, and reclassified handset revenue, which represented approximately 3% of fiscal 2011 revenue, from the communications end market to the consumer end market, for all periods presented.
Analog Devices, Fourth Quarter, Fiscal 2011
Schedule E
Revenue Trends by Product Type
The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

Table of Contents
On December 16, 2011, Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") received a notice required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regarding a blackout period, described below, under The Analog Devices, Inc. Investment Partnership Plan (the "Plan"), as a result of the conversion of the Analog Devices Stock Fund (the "Stock Fund") from a unitized stock fund to a real-time traded fund. Due to this change, Plan participants will be temporarily unable to request exchanges or obtain loans or distributions involving Plan assets invested in the common stock of the Company through the Stock Fund during a temporary blackout period that is scheduled to begin at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on Monday, January 23, 2012, and is expected to end on or about Thursday, January 26, 2012 (the "Plan Blackout Period").
On December 19, 2011 the Company sent a blackout trading restriction notice (the "BTR Notice") to its executive officers and directors informing them that, pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder, they would be prohibited during the Plan Blackout Period from purchasing or selling shares of the Company's common stock (including derivative securities pertaining to such shares) acquired in connection with their service or employment as a director or an executive officer.
A copy of the BTR Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Any inquiries regarding the Plan Blackout Period may be directed to Fidelity Investments at 1-888-ADI-7300.
(d) Exhibits
See the Exhibit Index attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

EXHIBIT 99.1
Analog Devices, Inc. is making a change to the Analog Devices, Inc. Investment Partnership Plan (the "TIP Plan") to convert the Analog Devices Stock Fund (the "Stock Fund") from a unitized fund to a real-time traded fund. This change will enable Stock Fund participants to buy and sell ADI shares in real time, which is the manner in which most corporate stock funds at other companies are now organized.
Fidelity will need at least two days to complete this conversion, and so we will be imposing a blackout period prohibiting transactions in the Stock Fund during the conversion period. The blackout period will begin at 4:00 p.m. ET on Monday, January 23, 2012, and is expected to end by Thursday, January 26, 2012 (note that there is a small possibility that Fidelity may require an extra day or two to complete the conversion). During the blackout period, those TIP Plan participants and beneficiaries with an investment in the Stock Fund will be unable to direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts, obtain a loan, make a withdrawal, or take other distributions involving TIP Plan assets invested in the Stock Fund.
Because of the trading blackout imposed on Stock Fund participants, Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires us to impose a trading blackout on all ADI Directors and Executive Officers during this conversion period (the "BTR Blackout Period"), regardless of whether those individuals are invested in the Stock Fund. However, because the BTR Blackout Period will take place during the Company's quarter-end blackout (which commences on January 14, 2012 and ends on February 27, 2012), as a practical matter the BTR Blackout Period will not result in any additional restrictions on Directors and Executive Officers beyond those already in effect due to the quarter-end blackout.
 
This trading restriction includes any indirect trading where you have a pecuniary interest in the transaction. Accordingly, acquisitions and dispositions by family members, partnerships, corporations, or trusts where you have a pecuniary interest are prohibited during the BTR Blackout Period.
During the BTR Blackout Period, you may not, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any shares of ADI common stock (including any stock options or other derivative securities) ("Company Securities"), subject to certain narrow exceptions set forth below.
There are limited exceptions to the BTR Blackout Period for certain transactions in Company Securities. Subject to compliance with our normal quarter-end blackout policies, during the BTR Blackout Period, you may:
As these exceptions are narrow, and because of the overlay of the Company's quarter-end blackout period, please discuss any proposed transactions with a member of ADI's Legal Department before you or your family members take any action concerning Company Securities during the BTR Blackout Period.
If you have any questions about the BTR Blackout Period or the information contained in this memo, please contact Kevin Lanouette, ADI's Assistant General Counsel at 781-461-3455.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Announces First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results; Increases Dividend by 20 Percent to $0.30 Per Share
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 22, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 14-week period that ended February 4, 2012. ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 20 percent increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock.
The first quarter results were within the range we expected. Revenue of $648 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.46 declined compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. Late in the first quarter, order rates began to accelerate and have remained solid so far this quarter. This leads us to believe that the first quarter marked the bottom of this industry cycle and we expect our business will improve beginning in the second quarter, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO.
Results for the 14-Week First Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue totaled $648 million
Gross margin was 63.2% of revenue
Operating margin was 28.3% of revenue
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.46
Cash flow from operations was $215 million, or 33% of revenue
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 28, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2012.
Outlook for the 13-Week Second Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue estimated at $655 million to $675 million
Gross margin estimated at 64% to 64.5%
Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $226 million
Diluted EPS estimated at $0.48 to $0.53
We expect most of the growth in the second quarter will come from our industrial customers, with more modest growth expected from the automotive, consumer, and communications infrastructure end markets in aggregate, said Mr. Fishman. Importantly, while we see improvement in our business, we are mindful of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and we will continue to aggressively monitor and control expenses in the second quarter.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
ADI will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone (call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI.")
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 855-859-2056 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 49242709, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information for Fiscal Year 2011 First Quarter
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years, which we now believe we can recover; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP diluted EPS has material limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 22, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended May 5, 2012.
ADI produced solid results for the second quarter. Compared to the immediately prior quarter, revenue grew 4%, led by strong sales across a wide range of industrial applications, and also increased sales into communications infrastructure applications. Diluted EPS grew 15%, well ahead of revenue growth, as gross margin and operating income expanded by 200 and 320 basis points, respectively. Operating cash flow continued to be very strong at $226 million, or approximately 34% of sales, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Order rates and backlog also grew compared to the prior quarter, which leads us to plan for continued sequential growth of revenue in the third quarter.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2012.
Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue totaled $675 million
Gross margin was 65.2% of revenue
Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue
Diluted EPS was $0.53
Cash flow from operations was $226 million, or 33.5% of revenue
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue estimated to increase sequentially by approximately 1% to 4%
Gross margin estimated to increase sequentially by approximately 50 basis points
Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $231 million
Diluted EPS estimated at $0.54 to $0.58
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET

Non-GAAP Financial Information for Fiscal Year 2011 Second Quarter
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Item.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP diluted EPS has material limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

This release may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, our statements regarding expected revenue,
earnings per share, operating expenses, gross margin, and other financial results, expected market trends, and expected customer demand and order rates for our products,
that are based on our current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business and the industry and markets in which Analog Devices operates. The statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward-looking statements, and such statements should not be relied upon as representing Analog Devices expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements made by us. Important factors that may affect future operating results include: sovereign debt issues globally, any faltering in global economic conditions or the stability of credit and financial markets, erosion of consumer confidence and declines in customer spending, unavailability of raw materials, services, supplies or manufacturing capacity, changes in geographic, product or customer mix, adverse results in litigation matters, and other risk factors described in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our results of operations for the periods presented in this release are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future periods.

Analog Devices, Second Quarter, Fiscal 2012
Schedule D
Revenue Trends by End Market
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Analog Devices, Second Quarter, Fiscal 2012
Schedule E
Revenue Trends by Product Type
The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

Analog Devices Reports Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 21, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended August 4, 2012.
ADI delivered solid results for the third quarter, with revenue increasing by 1% and diluted EPS increasing by 6% compared to the prior quarter. Profitability and cash flow remained strong, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Given the economic headwinds and uncertainty in most regions, we were encouraged by consistent order patterns among customers and distributors and by the resilience of our large and broad-based industrial business, as well as the communications, automotive, and consumer end markets.
Mr. Fishman continued, As a result of higher opening backlog and stable order patterns, we are planning for sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We expect that revenue from the industrial, communications, and automotive end markets will be similar to third quarter levels, in line with typical seasonal patterns. We are expecting sequential revenue growth from our consumer customers as is typical in the fourth quarter and also as a result of a strong new product cycle. In aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the range of $685 million to $715 million for the fourth quarter.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on September 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012.

Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Item.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

earnings per share, operating expenses, gross margin, and other financial results, expected product development and product cycle strength, expected market trends, and expected customer demand and order rates for our products,
that are based on our current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business and the industry and markets in which Analog Devices operates. The statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof.

Schedule D
Revenue Trends by End Market
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Analog Devices, Third Quarter, Fiscal 2012
Schedule E
Revenue Trends by Product Type
The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

2013 Executive Performance Incentive Plan
On October 25, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2013 Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "Executive Performance Incentive Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer are eligible to participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan. The foregoing description of the Executive Performance Incentive Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2013 Executive Performance Incentive Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01.
Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
On October 25, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2013 Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "Executive Performance Incentive Plan"). All executive officers and other senior management selected by the Chief Executive Officer will participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Plan. Bonus payments under the Executive Performance Incentive Plan are calculated and paid as follows:
1. Each participant's Fiscal 2013 Bonus Target is obtained by multiplying his or her Base Salary by his or her Individual Target Bonus Percentage:
 
 
2. Each participant's Fiscal 2013 Bonus Target is then multiplied by the Bonus Payout Factor. The Bonus Payout Factor is equal to (A) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's operating profit before tax (OPBT) as a percentage of revenue for the applicable quarter plus (B) 50% of the Bonus Payout Factor (as shown in the table below) based on the Company's revenue growth for the applicable quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year.
1
The calculations of revenue growth and OPBT as a percentage of revenue are adjustable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to take account of special items, including but not limited to: restructuring-related expense, acquisition- or disposition-related items, non-recurring royalty payments or receipts, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. If OPBT is equal to or less than 20% of revenue for the applicable quarter, the Bonus Payout Factor shall be zero for that quarter, even if the Company has revenue growth for that quarter. The Bonus Payout Factor can range from 0% to 300%.
The Compensation Committee adopted the following Bonus Payout Factor tables under the 2013 Executive Performance Incentive Plan:
 
 
The Bonus Payout Factor is determined quarterly and will be linearly interpolated between the values specified in the tables above. For example, if OPBT for a quarter is 32% of revenue (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 140% for that element) and revenue growth for the quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year was 11% (which would result in a Bonus Payout Factor of 130% for that element), then the Bonus Payout Factor for the quarter would be 135% which is the sum of 50% of the OPBT factor of 140% and 50% of the revenue growth factor of 130%. The Bonus Payout Factor is also used to determine the bonuses paid to all other employees of the Company under the Company's 2013 Bonus Plan for Employees.
A participant's bonus for a quarter shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying a participant's Fiscal 2013 Bonus Target for the quarter by the Bonus Payout Factor for that quarter. Each participant's Fiscal 2013 Bonus Payment can range from zero to three times his or her Fiscal 2013 Bonus Target.
3. Fiscal 2013 bonus payments, if any, under the Executive Performance Incentive Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and distributed after the first half and second half of fiscal year 2013. The bonus payment for the first half of Fiscal 2013 will be paid on or before June 30, 2013 and the bonus payment for the second half of Fiscal 2013 will be paid on or before December 31, 2013.
4. Executives are eligible for a bonus payment with respect to their first full fiscal quarter of employment, so long as they remain actively employed by the Company on the applicable bonus payment date in June or December. For example, an executive hired during the first quarter would only be eligible for a bonus payment with respect to the second quarter, so long as he or she was still actively employed on the June payment date.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Results
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 27, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 3, 2012.
ADI delivered solid results for the fourth quarter, with revenue increasing by 2% and diluted EPS increasing by 4% compared to the prior quarter, said Jerald G. Fishman, CEO. For the year, revenue decreased 9.8% to about $2.7 billion, reflecting difficult economic conditions and prevailing global uncertainty. We nevertheless generated 65% gross margins, 31% operating margins and over $800 million, or 30% of revenue, in cash from operations for the year.
Mr. Fishman continued, Overall orders decreased during the quarter as customers became more cautious and continued to reduce inventories, in many cases to historically low levels. As a result, we began reducing our production levels in the fourth quarter and will reduce them further in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While this will reduce gross margins in the short term, we believe this should provide significant operating leverage when growth resumes.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 18, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012.
Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue totaled $695 million
Gross margin was 63.8% of revenue
Operating margin was 31% of revenue
Diluted EPS was $0.58
Cash flow from operations was $236 million, or 34% of revenue
Results for Fiscal Year 2012
Revenue totaled $2.7 billion
Gross margin was 64.5% of revenue
Operating margin was 30.5% of revenue
Diluted EPS was $2.13
Cash flow from operations was $815 million, or 30% of revenue
Repurchases of common stock and dividend payments to shareholders totaled $505 million
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2013
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Revenue estimated to decrease in the range of -6% to -12%
Gross margin estimated to be approximately 62%
Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $223 million
Tax rate estimated to be approximately 18%
Diluted EPS estimated at $0.40 to $0.48
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
ADI will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone (call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI.")
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056 (replay only) and providing the conference ID:68650785, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 19, 2012, Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on December 19, 2017 with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and each lender from time to time party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"). At the closing, the Company did not borrow any funds under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement provides that the Company may borrow up to $500 million under revolving loans with a $75 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swing line loans. The Company may from time to increase the aggregate amount of the facility by an aggregate amount up to $250 million with additional commitments from existing or new lenders acceptable to the Company and the Administrative Agent, subject to certain conditions. The Company has agreed to pay customary facility fees to the lenders at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company's debt rating, as well as customary fronting fees to the letter of credit bank.
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a rate equal to (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin based on the Company's debt rating or (ii) the Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Bank of America prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus .50% and (iii) one month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin based on the Company's debt rating. Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin for Base Rate loans. Under the Credit Agreement, for each loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, the Company may select an interest period of one, two, three or six months, or such other period that is twelve months or less as requested by the Company and consented to by all the lenders.
Payments of the principal amounts of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement are due no later than December 19, 2017. The Company may prepay loans under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of borrowings that bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries, mergers and other fundamental changes, sales and other dispositions of property or assets and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, failure to perform covenants, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, insolvency or bankruptcy, customary ERISA defaults or the occurrence of a change of control.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the lenders and the other parties to the Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking, financial advisory or other services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have in the past and/or may in the future receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(f) . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C
Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this , it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority, other than any penalties, interest, or other charges attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Recipient as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

Survival
Section 3.01
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Committed Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Committed Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Committed Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Committed Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Committed Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of
 
such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Commited Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
(a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer;
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b) . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company would have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (but not loss of anticipated profits or margin) incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;
Section 10.13
 
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender as specified in this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 3.05
 
(a) . If any Lender requests compensation under , or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to , then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate amounts payable pursuant to or , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.

On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Borrower ("ADHBV"), entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. ADHBV's obligations are guaranteed by the Borrower. The credit agreement provides for a term loan facility of $145.0 million, which matures on December 22, 2013. The terms of the agreement provide for a three year principal amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date. The loan will bear interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.46% as of November 3, 2012). As of November 3, 2012, $14.5 million of this debt was classified as short-term.
On June 9, 2011, a merger subsidiary of the Borrower acquired privately-held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric). The acquisition agreement includes a contingent consideration arrangement requiring cash payments of up to $13.8 million to former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. As of November 3, 2012, $2.0 million has been paid. The acquisition agreement also requires the payment of royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25.0 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered. As of November 3, 2012, no royalty payments have been made.

Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results; Increases Dividend by $0.04 to $0.34 Per Share
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2013--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended February 2, 2013.
Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2013
Revenue totaled $622.1 million
Gross margin was 62.7% of revenue
Operating margin was 26.9% of revenue, excluding special items, and was 24.7% on a GAAP basis
Diluted EPS was $0.44, excluding special items, and was $0.42 on a GAAP basis
Cash flow from operations was $158 million, or 25.4% of revenue
Results for the first quarter were within the range we communicated and represented a generally weak macroeconomic environment exacerbated by year-end inventory reductions at many customers. Nevertheless, our operating performance remained strong, as we carefully managed our business to balance the long term opportunities for ADI with the realities of current market conditions, said Jerald G. Fishman, CEO. In January, order rates began to improve across most markets and geographies and have remained strong so far this quarter. As a result, we are planning for solid revenue growth in our second quarter, in the range of 4-8% sequentially with significant operating leverage.
ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 13 percent increase in its regular quarterly dividend, from $0.30 to $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2013.
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. The first quarter of fiscal year 2012 was a 14-week period. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, the Company recorded a $6.3 million tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January 2013, retroactive to January 1, 2012. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Item
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

ANALOG DEVICES GRIEVES SUDDEN PASSING OF JERRY FISHMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
NORWOOD, Mass. 
Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), with great sadness, announced today that Jerald G. Fishman passed away suddenly from an apparent heart attack yesterday evening. Mr. Fishman was 67 years old.
This is a terrible loss for me personally and for all of us here at ADI, said Ray Stata, Chairman of the Board. Jerry dedicated his entire career to building ADI into a great companyone of which we all are enormously proud. Jerrys commitment to ADI occupied a central part of his life and his passion for success was infectious. Jerry not only developed enormous respect both inside and outside the company as one of our industrys greatest leaders, but also for those like me who knew him well, he engendered a sense of affection and loyalty through his candor, openness, and integrity and through his unique sense of humor. While Jerry was extraordinarily passionate about his work and ADI, his greatest pride was his family and our thoughts are with them at this time. We shall miss Jerry deeply.
Jerry was born in 1945 and grew up in Flushing, NY. He graduated from the City College of New York with a BSEE degree. He went on to earn an MSEE degree from Northeastern University, an MBA from Boston University, and Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk Law School.
Jerry joined Analog Devices in 1971 in product marketing. His responsibilities and his contributions expanded quickly as he rose through the ranks of the company, and in 1991 he was named President and Chief Operating Officer. In 1996, he was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Jerrys contributions to ADI and the industry were recognized throughout his career.
In accordance with the Companys bylaws, ADIs President Vincent Roche has been appointed Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis by ADIs Board of Directors.
Vince, together with the leadership team Jerry put in place, know the company well and know what they have to do to continue the companys success, said Mr. Stata.

NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 21, 2013--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended May 4, 2013.
We had a solid second quarter led by strong sequential revenue growth from industrial and automotive applications, said Vincent Roche, President and CEO. Excluding special items, operating margins expanded 300 basis points compared to the prior quarter and diluted earnings per share grew three times faster than revenue over the same period, demonstrating the strength of our operating model.
Orders were higher in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, but customers remain cautious given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As a result, our outlook for the third quarter is for revenue to be approximately flat to up 4%, continued Mr. Roche. We are planning for margins to expand as factory utilization improves and for expenses to remain under tight control, which we believe will generate good earnings leverage and strong free cash flow.
ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 11, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013.
Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2013
Revenue totaled $659 million
Gross margin was 64% of revenue
Operating margin was 30% of revenue, excluding special items, and was 29% on a GAAP basis
Diluted EPS was $0.52
Cash flow from operations was $252 million, or 38% of revenue
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Revenue estimated to be in the range of $655 to $685 million
Gross margin estimated to be approximately 64.5%
Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $226 million
Tax rate estimated to be approximately 16.5%

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, following the death of the Companys CEO, the Company recorded $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement. This stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Stock-based Compensation Expense.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, the Company recorded a $6.3 million tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January 2013, retroactive to January 1, 2012. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a $6.6 million tax benefit as a result of the reversal of prior period tax liabilities. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

This release may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, our statements regarding expected revenue,

No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(d).
9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities hereunder on the Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this

In addition, if any Securities have been purchased hereunder, the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect.
11. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to the Representatives at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk  3rd floor; Telephone: (212) 834-4533; Fax: (212) 834-6081, or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062, Attention: General Counsel; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8 will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to such Underwriter.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% Senior Notes due June 1, 2023 (the "Debt Securities"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of May 22, 2013 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and J.P.

We have also assumed the due authentication of the Debt Securities by the Trustee, that there will not have occurred, prior to the date of issuance of the Debt Securities, any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of such Debt Securities and that at the time of the issuance and sale of the Debt Securities, the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof acting pursuant to authority properly delegated to such committee by the Board of Directors) has not taken any action to rescind or otherwise reduce its prior authorization of the issuance of the Debt Securities.

2.2.25 whether the Securities of such Series will be senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities and, if applicable, a description of the subordination terms thereof.
 
All Securities of any one Series need not be issued at the same time and may be issued from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Indenture, if so provided by or pursuant to the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate referred to above.
 
An Officer shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature.
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall nevertheless be valid.
A Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee shall at any time, and from time to time, authenticate Securities for original issue in the principal amount provided in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication unless otherwise provided by a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate.
The aggregate principal amount of Securities of any Series outstanding at any time may not exceed any limit upon the maximum principal amount for such Series set forth in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2, except as provided in Section 2.8.
Prior to the issuance of Securities of any Series, the Trustee shall have received and (subject to Section 7.2) shall be fully protected in relying on: (a) the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate establishing the form of the Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series and the terms of the Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series, (b) an Officers' Certificate complying with Section 10.4, and (c) an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 10.4 and to the effect that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the purchasers thereof and subject to such other conditions, qualifications and exceptions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities of such Series: (a) if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not be taken lawfully; or (b) if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or vice presidents shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to Holders of any then outstanding Series of Securities.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.
 
The Company shall maintain, with respect to each Series of Securities, at the place or places specified with respect to such Series pursuant to Section 2.2, an office or agency where Securities of such Series may be presented or surrendered for payment ("Paying Agent"), where Securities of such Series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such Series and this Indenture may be served ("Service Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register with respect to each Series of Securities and to their transfer and exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address, and any change in the name or address, of each Registrar, Paying Agent or Service Agent. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Registrar, Paying Agent
 
or Service Agent or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the name and address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more co-registrars, additional paying agents or additional service agents and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent and Service Agent in each place so specified pursuant to Section 2.2 for Securities of any Series for such purposes.
The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the name or address of any such co-registrar, additional paying agent or additional service agent. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar; the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent; and the term "Service Agent" includes any additional service agent.
The Company hereby appoints the Trustee the initial Registrar, Paying Agent and Service Agent for each Series unless another Registrar, Paying Agent or Service Agent, as the case may be, is appointed prior to the time Securities of that Series are first issued.
 
The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust, for the benefit of Securityholders of any Series of Securities, or the Trustee, all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Series of Securities, and will notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of Securityholders of any Series of Securities all money held by it as Paying Agent.
 
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders of each Series of Securities and shall otherwise comply with TIA  312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least ten days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list, in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of Securityholders of each Series of Securities.
 
Where Securities of a Series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same Series, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions are met. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6 or 9.6).
Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange Securities of any Series for the period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days immediately preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that Series and ending at the close of business on the day of such
 
mailing, or (b) thereafter to issue, register the transfer of or exchange (i) any Securities of a Series for which notice has been given calling for redemption of such Series as a whole, or (ii) that portion of the Securities of a Series to be redeemed for which notice has been given calling for redemption of the Series in part.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest on a Global Security effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof and those described in this Section as not outstanding.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.8, it ceases to be outstanding until the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on the Maturity of Securities of a Series money sufficient to pay such Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities of the Series cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.2.
 
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities of a Series have concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, Securities of a Series owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver only Securities of a Series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
 
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a Company Order. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee upon request shall authenticate definitive Securities of the same Series and date of maturity in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, temporary securities shall have the same rights under this Indenture as the definitive Securities.
 
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and, upon the Company's written request, deliver a certificate of such cancellation to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. All cancelled Securities shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act).
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a Series of Securities, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent required by the notes in such Series and to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of the Series on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix the record date and payment date. At least 10 days before the record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder of the Series a notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount of interest to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
 
2.14.1 . A Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate shall establish whether the Securities of a Series shall be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities and the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities.
Terms of Securities
2.14.2 . Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in Section 2.7 of the Indenture and in addition thereto, any Global Security shall be exchangeable pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Indenture for Securities registered in the names of Holders other than the Depositary for such Security or its nominee only if (i) such Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and, in either case, the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act within 90 days of such event or (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct in writing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security with like tenor and terms.
Transfer and Exchange
 
Except as provided in this Section 2.14.2, a Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary with respect to such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary, by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such a successor Depositary.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
2.14.3 . Any Global Security issued hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:
Legend
"This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such a successor Depositary."
2.14.4 . The Depositary, as a Holder, may appoint agents and otherwise authorize participants to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action which a Holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture.
Acts of Holders
2.14.5 . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Indenture, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof.
Payments
2.14.6 . Except as provided in Section 2.14.5, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Securities of such Series represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depositary with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
Consents, Declaration and Directions
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other elements of identification printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any Series, in writing, of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers of that Series.
 
The Company may, with respect to any Series of Securities, reserve the right to redeem and pay the Series of Securities or may covenant to redeem and pay the Series of Securities or any part thereof prior to the Stated
 
Maturity thereof at such time and on such terms as provided for in such Securities. If a Series of Securities is redeemable and the Company wants or is obligated to redeem prior to the Stated Maturity thereof all or part of the Series of Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, it shall notify the Trustee of the redemption date and the principal amount of Series of Securities to be redeemed. The Company shall give the notice at least 30 days before the redemption date (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Trustee).
 
Unless otherwise indicated for a particular Series by a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate, if less than all the Securities of a Series are to be redeemed, the Trustee or Depositary, as applicable, shall select the Securities of the Series to be redeemed by lot or pursuant to the Depositary's applicable procedures. The Trustee or Depositary, as applicable, shall make the selection from Securities of the Series outstanding not previously called for redemption. The Trustee or Depositary, as applicable, may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities of the Series that have denominations larger than $1,000. Securities of the Series and portions of them it selects shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 or, with respect to Securities of any Series issuable in other denominations pursuant to Section 2.2.10, the minimum principal denomination for each Series and integral multiples thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities of a Series called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities of that Series called for redemption.
 
Unless otherwise indicated for a particular Series by Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder whose Securities are to be redeemed.
The notice shall identify the Securities of the Series to be redeemed and shall state:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at its expense; provided that the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, at least 15 days prior to delivering notice of redemption (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the Trustee), an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.
 
Once notice of redemption is mailed or published as provided in Section 3.3, Securities of a Series called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
 
On or before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest, if any, on all Securities to be redeemed on that date.
 
Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder a new Security of the same Series and the same maturity equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of each Series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of that Series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the SEC copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA  314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, an Officers' Certificate stating that a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the signing Officers with a view to determining whether the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating, as to each such Officer signing such certificate, that to the best of his/her knowledge the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of which he may have knowledge).
The Company will, so long as any of the Securities are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, promptly upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture or the Securities; and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted.
 
Subject to Article V, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and rights (charter and statutory); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders.
 
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, any person (a "successor person") unless:
 
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and any supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the above, any Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties to the Company. Neither an Officers' Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required to be delivered in connection therewith.
 
Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 5.1, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor person has been named as the Company herein; provided, however, that the predecessor Company in the case of a sale, conveyance or other disposition (other than a lease) shall be released from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.
 
 
wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any Series, means any one of the following events, unless in the establishing Board Resolution, supplemental indenture or Officers' Certificate, it is provided that such Series shall not have the benefit of said Event of Default:
"Event of Default"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or
 
The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar U.S. federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any Series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default referred to in Section 6.1(d) or (e)) then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series may declare the principal amount (or, if any Securities of that Series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such Securities) of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the Securities of that Series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(d) or (e) shall occur, the principal amount (or specified amount) of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to any Series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that Series, other than the non-payment of the principal and interest of the Securities of that Series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.13 and the Company has paid to the Trustee all fees and expenses then owed to the Trustee hereunder.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
The Company covenants that if
 
 
 
, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and any overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
then
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or deemed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any Series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such Series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
 
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7; and
Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
 
Third: To the Company.
 
No Holder of any Security of any Series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
 
 
 
 
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 2.8, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not, to the extent permitted by law, prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such Series, provided that
 
 
 
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such Series waive any past Default hereunder with respect to such Series and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security of such Series (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in
 
principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
 
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its authentication.
 
If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any Series and if it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder of the Securities of that Series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has knowledge of such Default or Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security of any Series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as its corporate trust committee or a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Securityholders of that Series.
 
Within 60 days after May 15 in each year, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear on the register kept by the Registrar, a brief report dated as of such May 15, in accordance with, and to the extent required under, TIA  313.
 
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders of any Series shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities of that Series are listed. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when Securities of any Series are listed on any stock exchange.
 
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree upon in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee (including the cost of defending itself) against any loss, liability or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred by it except as set forth in the next paragraph in the performance of its duties under this Indenture as Trustee or Agent. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This indemnification shall apply to officers, directors, employees, shareholders and agents of the Trustee.
The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability determined to have been caused by the Trustee through its own negligence or willful misconduct.
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities of any Series on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities of that Series.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(d) or (e) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The provisions of this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture.
 
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.
The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more Series by so notifying the Company at least 30 days prior to the date of the proposed resignation. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any Series may remove the Trustee with respect to that Series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The Company may remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of one or more Series if:
 
 
 
 
 
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any one or more Series does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of the applicable Series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.7, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee with respect to each Series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to each Securityholder of each such Series. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee with respect to expenses and liabilities incurred by it prior to such replacement.
 
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
 
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA  310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b).
 
The Trustee is subject to TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
 
This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, if so requested by the Company, shall at the expense of the Company execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the Company, in the case of (1), (2) or (3) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose, money or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient (unless funds consist solely of money) in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, without consideration of any reinvestment, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
 
 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.7, and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section, the provisions of Sections 2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 8.2, 8.5 and 8.6 shall survive.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless this Section 8.3 is otherwise specified, pursuant to Section 2.2.22, to be inapplicable to Securities of any Series, the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding Securities of any Series on the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred to in subparagraph (d) hereof, and the provisions of this Indenture, as it relates to such outstanding Securities of such Series, shall no longer be in effect (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall, at Company Request, execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except as to:
 
 
 
provided that, the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless this Section 8.4 is otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.2.22 to be inapplicable to Securities of any Series, the Company may omit to comply with respect to the Securities of any Series with any term, provision or condition set forth under Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 as well as any additional covenants specified in a supplemental indenture for such Series of Securities or a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2.22 (and the failure to comply with any such covenants shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to such Series under Section 6.1) and the occurrence of any event specified in a supplemental indenture for such Series of Securities or a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2.18 and designated as an Event of Default shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder, with respect to the Securities of such Series, provided that the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal and interest that remains unclaimed for two years. After that, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money deposited with respect to Securities of any Series in accordance with Section 8.1 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such Series and under the Securities of such Series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.1 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.1; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of principal of or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
 
The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities of one or more Series without the consent of any Securityholder:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company and the Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each Series affected by such supplemental indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities of such Series), for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Securityholders of each such Series. Except as provided in Section 6.13, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series by notice to the Trustee (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities of such Series) may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities with respect to such Series.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After a supplemental indenture or waiver under this section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Securities affected thereby, a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture or waiver. Any failure by the Company to mail or publish such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
 
Without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment or waiver may not:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities of one or more Series shall be set forth in a supplemental indenture hereto that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
 
Until an amendment is set forth in a supplemental indenture or a waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date of the supplemental indenture or the date the waiver becomes effective.
Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Securityholder of each Series affected by such amendment or waiver unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (a) through (h) of Section 9.3. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment or waiver on any Security of any Series thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for Securities of that Series may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate upon request new Securities of that Series that reflect the amendment or waiver.
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, in addition to the documents required by Section 10.4 and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee shall sign all supplemental indentures, except that the Trustee need not sign any supplemental indenture that adversely affects its rights.
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required or deemed to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, such required or deemed provision shall control.
 
Any notice or communication by the Company or the Trustee to the other, or by a Holder to the Company or the Trustee, is duly given if in writing and delivered in person or mailed by first-class mail:
 
 
The Company or the Trustee by notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications.
Any notice or communication to a Securityholder shall be mailed by first-class mail to his address shown on the register kept by the Registrar. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Securityholder of any Series or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Securityholders of that or any other Series.
If a notice or communication is mailed or published in the manner provided above, within the time prescribed, it is duly given, whether or not the Securityholder receives it.
If the Company mails a notice or communication to Securityholders, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each Agent at the same time.
In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee agrees to accept and act upon notice, instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by unsecured e-mail, facsimile transmission or other similar unsecured electronic methods, provided, however, that the Trustee shall have received an incumbency certificate listing persons designated to give such instructions or directions and containing specimen signatures of such designated persons, which such incumbency certificate shall be amended and replaced whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If anyone elects to give the Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, the Trustee's understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee's reliance upon and compliance with such instructions, including in the event that such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties.
 
Securityholders of any Series may communicate pursuant to TIA  312(b) with other Securityholders of that Series or any other Series with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities of that Series or all Series. The Company, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA  312(c).
 
Upon any request or application by the Company to the Trustee to take any action under this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee as appropriate:
 
 
 
Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture (other than a certificate provided pursuant to TIA  314(a)(4)) shall comply with the provisions of TIA  314(e) and shall include:
 
 
 
 
 
The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of Securityholders of one or more Series. Any Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable requirements for its functions.
 
Unless otherwise provided by Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture hereto for a particular Series, a "Legal Holiday" is any day that is not a Business Day. If a payment date is a Legal Holiday at a place of payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.
 
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
 
THIS INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
This Indenture may not be used to interpret another indenture, loan or debt agreement of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. Any such indenture, loan or debt agreement may not be used to interpret this Indenture.
 
All agreements of the Company in this Indenture and the Securities shall bind its successor. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successor.
 
In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
The Table of Contents, Cross Reference Table, and headings of the Articles and Sections of this Indenture have been inserted for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part hereof, and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions hereof.
 
Unless otherwise specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Indenture with respect to a particular Series of Securities, whenever for purposes of this Indenture any action may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all Series or all Series affected by a particular action at the time outstanding and, at such time, there are outstanding Securities of any Series which are denominated in a coin or currency other than Dollars, then the principal amount of Securities of such Series which shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of taking such action shall be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount at the Market Exchange Rate at such time. For purposes of this Section 10.15, "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean the noon Dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of that currency as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If such Market Exchange Rate is not available for any reason with respect to such currency, the Company or its designated agent shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of the most recent available date, or quotations from one or more major banks in The City of New York or in the country of issue of the currency in question or such other quotations as the Company or its designated agent, upon consultation with the Company, shall deem appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply in determining the equivalent principal amount in respect of Securities of a Series denominated in currency other than Dollars in connection with any action taken by Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
All decisions and determinations of the Company or its designated agent regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, to the extent permitted by law, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company and all Holders.
 
The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of or interest or other amount on the Securities of any Series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with accepted procedures in the banking industry the Required Currency could be purchased with the Judgment Currency in The City of New York on the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a New York Banking Day, then the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with accepted procedures in the banking industry the Required Currency could be purchased with the Judgment Currency in The City of New York on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (b) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (a), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable, and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture. For purposes of the foregoing, "New York Banking Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.
 
The Company hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York or any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York in respect of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Indenture and the Notes, and irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts.
 
EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE.
 
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of the Securities of a Series, except as otherwise permitted or required by any form of Security of such Series issued pursuant to this Indenture.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any Series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment" and any other amount provided for by the terms of Securities of such Series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any Series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 11.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any Series as provided for by the terms of the Securities of such Series.
 
The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any Series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (1) deliver outstanding Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable (other than any of such Securities previously called for mandatory sinking fund redemption) and (2) apply as credit Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable and which have been repurchased by the Company or redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Series of Securities (except pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund) or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments or other optional redemptions pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited.
