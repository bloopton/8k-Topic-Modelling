In the event that any Shares are included in any Registration Statement, to the extent permitted by law, each Investor will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any underwriter and any other Investor selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other Investor's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such Investor, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such Investor, or partner, director, officer or controlling person of such other Investor may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Investor under an instrument duly executed by such Investor and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and each such Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Investor, or partner, officer, director, or controlling person of such other Investor in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a Violation; provided, however, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Investor.
Promptly after receipt by any indemnified person of a notice of a claim or the beginning of any action in respect of which indemnity is to be sought against an indemnifying person pursuant to this Section 7.3, such indemnified person shall notify the indemnifying person in writing of such claim or of the commencement of such action, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 7.3 (except to the extent that such omission materially and adversely affects the indemnifying party's ability to defend such action) or from any liability otherwise than under this Section 7.3. Subject to the provisions hereinafter stated, in case any such action shall be brought against an indemnified person, the indemnifying person shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it shall elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person. After notice from the indemnifying person to such indemnified person of its election to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying person shall not be liable to such indemnified person for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified person in connection with the defense thereof, , , that if there exists or shall exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified person, for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified person and such indemnifying person or any affiliate or associate thereof, the indemnified person shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of such indemnifying person; , , that no indemnifying person shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties. In no event shall any indemnifying person be liable in respect of any amounts paid in settlement of any action unless the indemnifying person shall have approved the terms of such settlement; that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No indemnifying person shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.3 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under this Section 7.3 in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Investors on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or other matters which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, in the case of an untrue statement, whether the untrue statement relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or an Investor on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement. The Company and the Investors agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Investors were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Investor shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the gross amount received by the Investor from the sale of the Shares to which such loss relates exceeds the amount of any damages which such Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Investors' obligations in this subsection to contribute are several in proportion to their sales of Shares to which such loss relates and not joint.
The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge that they are sophisticated business persons who were represented by counsel during the negotiations regarding the provisions hereof including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 7.3, and are fully informed regarding said provisions. They further acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 7.3 fairly allocate the risks in light of the ability of the parties to investigate the Company and its business in order to assure that adequate disclosure is made in the Registration Statement as required by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties are advised that federal or state public policy as interpreted by the courts in certain jurisdictions may be contrary to certain of the provisions of this Section 7.3, and the parties hereto hereby expressly waive and relinquish any right or ability to assert such public policy as a defense to a claim under this Section 7.3 and further agree not to attempt to assert any such defense.

Exhibit 99.1
Santa Clara, Calif. - November 15, 2002 -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement for a private placement of common stock to a group of institutional investors led by existing shareholders, raising approximately
$18 million. The group of investors was led by The Carlyle Group of Washington, DC, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers of Menlo Park, California, and Gund Investment Corporation, headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.
The transaction involves the sale of 9.5 million newly issued shares of Align common stock at a price of $1.90 per share, a premium to the recent trading range of ALGN shares on Nasdaq. The shares will not be registered for resale with the Securities and Exchange Commission until one year from the closing date.
Align President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M. Prescott said that the funds raised will be used primarily to fuel the continued growth of Invisalign in its core orthodontic and dental markets and for working capital needs as the company nears profitability during the coming quarters. The Company also expects to complete a revolving credit and equipment financing facility totaling approximately $10 - $15 million in the near future.
"We believe that this round of funding and the soon to be completed credit facility eliminate any perceived financing risk associated with our operation and will give us the capital structure necessary to execute our plan. The continued support of our existing shareholders and the overall quality of our institutional investor base demonstrate strong endorsement for our operational and marketing initiatives. The willingness of these institutions to invest at a premium to market price is a further indication of their confidence in the prospects of our products and our Company."
The Company has also reaffirmed existing financial guidance for the remainder of 2002 as well as 2003. More specifically, as stated in the October 24, 2002 investor conference call, the Company expects to achieve revenues of approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter 2002 and gross margins of 50 to 52 percent. This will bring total revenues for 2002 to approximately $75 million.
For 2003, the Company expects revenues of $100 to$105 million with gross margins exceeding 60 percent by the end of the year. With a diligent focus on spending throughout 2003, losses are expected to decline significantly throughout 2003, allowing the Company to achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of 2003. Projections provided do not include the effects of restructuring charges or stock-based compensation.
About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary new method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.

The information in this Form 8-K and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today announced financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2003.

"I am pleased with the progress we are making as a company. We are working to create a strong customer base resulting in growth in our case shipments and revenues," said Thomas M.

As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks relating to Align's history of losses and negative operating cash flows, Align's ability to increase its revenue significantly while controlling expenses, Align's ability to raise additional capital as required, Align's limited operating history, demand for Invisalign, acceptance of Invisalign by consumers and dental professionals, competition from manufacturers of traditional braces, Align's third party manufacturing processes and personnel, foreign operational,

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Align uses a non-GAAP measure of net loss, which is adjusted to exclude certain costs and expenses. We believe that our non-GAAP net loss gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net loss is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Reports Record Revenues of $29.2 Million for the Second Quarter 2003 - Second Quarter Revenues Increase 86% Year Over Year; Net Loss Decreases 62% Year Over Year - Company to Restate Approximately $9 Million in Prior Period Net Revenue; Will Restate Results for FY 2001, FY 2002, and the First Quarter of FY 2003 - Restatement Will Have No Effect on Business Operations, Cash Flow or Liquidity SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported record revenues of $29.2 million for the second quarter of 2003. "We are pleased with the progress we are making," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "The solid results delivered this quarter are driven by adoption and utilization by orthodontists and general practitioner dentists as they, and their patients, experience outstanding results first-hand. Our operating profile continues to improve and we continue to aggressively decrease our net loss. Our focus on the balance sheet is also showing as we increased our cash resources by over $1 million this quarter. We have much to do, yet these results should indicate we are on the right path." Second Quarter Results The Company reported total revenues for the second quarter of 2003 of $29.2 million, compared to $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 27.3 percent, and $15.7 million in the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 86.0 percent. The net loss for the second quarter of 2003, as reported under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), was $7.8 million, or a net loss per share of $0.13. This compares to a net loss for the first quarter of 2003 of $10.7 million, or a net loss of $0.19 per share, and a net loss for the second quarter of 2002 of $20.3 million, or a net loss of $0.44 per share. Net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was impacted by a $1.4 million charge to operating expense in connection with sales tax for which the Company decided during the quarter not to pursue collection from its customers. In addition, the net loss was impacted by a $400 thousand charge to cost of revenues related to certain use tax matters. Second quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2003 GAAP financial data is presented on an as restated basis. Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2003, which excludes $4.4 million of stock-based compensation, was $3.4 million, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.06 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $14.5 million, in the second quarter of 2002, which excludes $5.9 million of stock-based compensation, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.31 per share. Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2003 included the same charge for sales and use tax of $1.8 million included in the GAAP net loss above. Non-GAAP second quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2003 financial data is presented on an as adjusted basis. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net loss for the second quarter of 2003 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial data. As of June 30, 2003, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $1.1 million to $38.4 million, compared to $37.3 million as of March 31, 2003, without incurring new debt or drawing down on a line of credit. $9.0 Million Net Revenue Restatement In conjunction with the Company's adoption during the quarter of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21), which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services, the Company also reviewed its revenue recognition policies governing case refinement (a case refinement occurs when Aligners are prescribed by the clinician for patients needing tooth movements beyond the original prescription). Based on this review, the Company will reverse previous loss accruals of approximately $900 thousand and defer net revenues of approximately $9.0 million recorded in prior periods. These revenues will be recognized primarily in the second half of fiscal year 2003 and throughout fiscal year 2004. The Company will restate its financial results for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, including the related interim periods, and the first quarter of 2003. Revenues will be reduced and deferred by approximately $1.6 million, $5.7 million and $1.8 million in fiscal year 2001, fiscal year 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, respectively. The Company stated that these prior period adjustments will have no effect on business operations, cash flow or liquidity. When the Company began offering case refinement as a finishing tool in June 2001, the Company charged $50 for this product if it was purchased at the beginning of a treatment period, and $250 if it was purchased during the course of treatment. The Company deferred $50 of revenue and accrued any anticipated losses related to the cost of producing and delivering each case refinement sold at the beginning of the treatment period until either the case refinement was utilized or upon case expiration. Over the past two years, the demand for case refinements has been higher than was originally anticipated when the product was first introduced. In light of the aforementioned changes in product demand and the adoption of EITF 00-21, the Company reevaluated the accounting treatment for case refinement revenues under the principals contained in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), and related guidance. The Company has determined that the revenue amount deferred for each case refinement in prior periods should have been $250 rather than $50, as previously deferred. The Company's restated financial statements will reflect this appropriate deferral amount. On May 1, 2003, the Company updated its pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of $125 each, which the Company believes represents the fair value based on competitive product offerings. Revenue deferrals associated with future case refinements will be $125, which was determined in a manner consistent with the newly adopted rules contained in EITF 00-21. These revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration. The Company expects to file its amended 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which will include the restated consolidated financial statements for the years 2002 and 2001 and the corresponding interim periods, and its amended 10-Q for the first quarter of 2003 as soon as possible. The Company does not propose to file amendments to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ending June 30, 2001 through September 30, 2002, nor their Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2001, and accordingly, these filings should be disregarded. Align Technology will host a webcast and conference call today, July 24, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. EDT, 2:00 p.m. PDT, to review second quarter of 2003 results, discuss the reallocation and restatement of revenues, and discuss future operating trends and guidance on the outlook for the future.

Exhibit 99.1 Align Technology, Inc. Reports Record Revenues of $34.0 Million for the Third Quarter 2003 - Third Quarter Revenues Increase 96% Year Over Year - Company Reports GAAP Net Loss of $2.1 Million, or $0.04 per share; Non-GAAP Net Profit Of $1.2 Million and Non-GAAP EPS Of $0.02 Per Share - Company Increases Cash Position By $4.3 Million SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2003. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2003 were $34.0 million, compared to $29.2 million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 16.5 percent, and $17.4 million in the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 95.9 percent. "We are pleased to report our first profitable quarter on a non-GAAP basis," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "While achievement of this important milestone signifies the enormous progress made over the past six quarters, we still have much to do towards our goal of building a truly great company. Align is focused on becoming the most important part of our customers' practices and helping them provide outstanding clinical results to happier patients. As we meet or exceed their high expectations, we expect our business to accelerate and our shareholders to benefit." The net loss for the third quarter of 2003 as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") was $2.1 million, or a net loss per share of $0.04. This compares to a net loss for the second quarter of 2003 of $7.8 million, or a net loss of $0.13 per share, and a net loss for the third quarter of 2002 of $17.8 million, or a net loss of $0.38 per share. The non-GAAP net profit for the third quarter of 2003, which excludes $3.4 million of stock-based compensation, was $1.2 million, or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02. This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2003, which excludes $4.4 million of stock-based compensation, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.06 per share. This also compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $11.0 million in the third quarter of 2002, which excludes $6.8 million of stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.24 per share. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net loss for the third quarter of 2003 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements.

Santa Clara, Calif.  January 29, 2004  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2003. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $36.5 million, compared to $34.0 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 7.4 percent, and $20.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of 75.5 percent. For fiscal year 2003, Align reported revenues of $122.7 million, compared to $69.7 million for fiscal year 2002, an increase of 76.0 percent.
 
"2003 was a great year for Align in all aspects of our business," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "Programs in marketing, clinical education and customer support, in conjunction with operational improvements, have led to record revenues, margins and, in the fourth quarter, GAAP profitability. Going forward in 2004, we expect to continue providing the best product and support for our customers as we seek to build a lasting and profitable company for our shareholders."
 
The net profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") was $2.5 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04. These amounts, and the amounts discussed below, do not include any charges that the Company may incur as a result of the Dental Discus arbitration (discussed below). This compares to a net loss for the third quarter of 2003 of $2.1 million, or a net loss of $0.04 per basic and diluted share, and a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 of $15.4 million, or a net loss of $0.30 per basic and diluted share. For fiscal year 2003, the net loss under GAAP was $18.0 million, or a net loss of $0.31 per basic and diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $72.8 million for fiscal year 2002, or a net loss of $1.52 per basic and diluted share.
 
The non-GAAP net profit for the fourth quarter of 2003, which excludes $3.0 million of stock-based compensation, was $5.6 million, or basic non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.09. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2003, which excludes $3.4 million of stock-based compensation, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.02. This also compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, which excludes $3.8 million of stock-based compensation and $3.4 million of restructuring charges, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.16 per basic and diluted share. For the fiscal year 2003, the non-GAAP net loss, which excludes $15.0 million of stock-based compensation and $0.5 million of restructuring charges, was $2.5 million, or a non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.04. This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $47.3 million for fiscal year 2002, which excludes $20.3 million of stock-based compensation and $5.2 million of restructuring charges, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.99 per basic and diluted share. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net loss for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2003 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements.
 
As of December 31, 2003 Align had $47.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $42.7 million as of September 30, 2003 and $41.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Align Technology did not incur additional borrowings or draw-downs against its credit facility during 2003.
 
Update to Discus Dental Impressions Arbitration
 
A three-arbitrator Panel from the American Arbitration Association issued an interim ruling in connection with Align Technology's arbitration with Discus Dental Impressions ("Discus"). Although the Panel's interim ruling found that Align's termination of its marketing agreement with Discus was wrongful, the Panel awarded Discus damages in the amount of only $1.00. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the original contract, the prevailing party in the arbitration is entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the Panel. Discus has requested that the Panel award it $2.6 million in attorney's fees and costs and Align has disputed this amount. Align expects the Panel to issue its final ruling, including determination of reasonable attorney fees and costs payable to Discus, prior to filing the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2003. If the final ruling is made prior to the filing of the Form 10-K, the Company will include a charge relating to the arbitration in its 2003 financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company expects to issue a press release with updated 2003 financials when the final ruling is issued.

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Align uses a non-GAAP measure of net profit (loss), which is adjusted to exclude certain costs and expenses and any associated tax effects of such adjustments.

In addition, our non-GAAP net profit (loss) is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
 
On February 10, 2004, Align Technology, Inc. (Align) announced the conclusion of legal arbitration proceedings initiated by Discus Dental Impressions (Discus). Under the final arbitration award, Discus is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $1.00 and reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2.1 million. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators found that Align's termination of its marketing agreement with Discus in April of 2002 was wrongful. Because the final decision of the arbitrators has been issued prior to the filing of the Align's Form 10-K for fiscal 2003, Align will include a charge relating to the final arbitration award in its 2003 financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The updated 2003 financial statements for Align's fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Santa Clara, Calif.  February 10, 2004  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, announced today the conclusion of legal arbitration proceedings initiated by Discus Dental Impressions (Discus). Under the final arbitration award, Discus is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $1.00 and reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2.1 million. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators found that Align's termination of its marketing agreement with Discus in April of 2002 was wrongful. As previously disclosed, because the final decision of the arbitrators has been issued prior to the filing of the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal 2003, the Company will include a charge relating to the final arbitration award in its 2003 financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The updated 2003 condensed consolidated financial statements are attached.
 
About Align Technology, Inc.
 
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Align uses a non-GAAP measure of net profit (loss), which is adjusted to exclude certain costs and expenses and any associated tax effects of such adjustments. We believe that our non-GAAP net profit (loss) gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net profit (loss) is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Santa Clara, Calif.  April 22, 2004  Align Technology, Inc.

Thomas M Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Thank you Barbara. And welcome to our shareholders and friends who are listening on the phone today and through our web site. We have gotten off to a very good start in 2004. Eldon will go more deeply into the financials in just a few minutes, but let me start with some top and bottom line highlights. We reported $39.2m in revenues for the first quarter of 2004. This is a sequential increase of 7.4% over the fourth quarter and an increase of 70.8% over the same quarter last year. We also reported our second GAAP profitable quarter at a penny of EPS. Net profit was $557,000. Let me first take you to some key operating metrics and follow up with some statements about our strategies and key priorities. On the revenue side, both the orthodontist and GP dentist channel revenues and cases continue to increase. We saw a sequential increase in the ortho channel of 5.2% to $21.5m. GP revenues sequentially increased 18.1% to $12.6m. Overall, 55% of total revenues came from US orthodontists. During the quarter, we received orders for approximately 23,700 net new cases. This was an average of 376 cases per business day, and increase of 9% from the previous quarter. We shipped over 22,000 cases worldwide to customers this quarter and an increase of 8% over the previous quarter. Finally, I would to like share some case volume and channel statistics with you.
 
Approximately 7,700 doctors worldwide submitted cases during the first quarter, compared with 7,300 last quarter. The number of orthodontist submitting cases went up slightly to almost 3,800. 3,950 GP dentist submitted cases compared with 3,550. That's 3,950 GP's submitting versus 3,550 last quarter. Additionally, we
 
trained and certified over 700 new GP's in the US during the first quarter, bringing our base of certified GP's in North America to 10,400. And we've done a solid job of having doctors initiating Invisalign into their practices and return for additional case starts. Just over 82% of our North American clinicians and 80% of our certified docs worldwide have submitted more than one case. Let me turn now to some key activities and accomplishments in the first quarter. To start with, the first quarter has been a bit slower in terms of key events such as training, seminars and conferences for Align. While we did host a number of clinical education events, we expect to increase that significantly in the quarters to come. One addition we made in the first quarter was to launch a new advanced Invisalign Provider Workshop or IPW. The IPW-II Seminar is an advanced workshop for orthodontists. It's more clinically intensive and trains orthodontists on cases such as extraction and surgery. This seminar is for highly experienced docs who we believe will extend the applicability of the product by submitting cases with a higher degree of difficulty thus expanding our market reach and penetration.
 
We also negotiated a marketing partnership with CareCredit. CareCredit is one of the leading third-party financing organizations that offer flexible payment options to patients. We assisted in negotiating preferred discount rates for the doctors using CareCredit to finance Invisalign cases for their patients. This enables them to capture the entire patient fee upfront from CareCredit at a lower merchant fee while their patients have a variety of payment options to choose from. We understand from our doctors that the most popular product has been the 12-month no-interest loan. For Align, we believe this will help doctors expand their practices because they are able to charge a lower down-payment, avoid collection hassles and enable patients who are reluctant to enter treatment because of cost realize their dreams of having straight teeth the Invisalign way.
 
As part of our additional efforts to increase our presence in the North American GP market, we continue to expand our GP sales force. This expansion brings our overall domestic field organization to approximately 75 people. On the manufacturing side, we continued our automation improvements with the FlexLink material handling system. This has proved to be a significant enhancement in our aligner fabrication process. As we continue integrating FlexLink and other related technology into our manufacturing processes, we expect continued improvements in flexibility, scalability, and gross margin.
 
Moving forward in 2004, we'll continue to invest in programs that will insure robust operating platform and create leverage from the growth in cases we expect to continue. As developments occur, we'll spend time talking about them with you. Right now we're in the beginning stages of implementation, and it will be some time before we see quantitative results from that hard work.
 
We still have a lot of work to do. Our product Invisalign has an incredible market opportunity and we have a ways to go to ensure that we have the most predictable, reliable, customer-friendly solution possible, which will compel our customers to continue prescribing this treatment.
 
Let me just step back for a second. We have a number of new shareholders listening to the call today who may not fully understand our market opportunity. In the US alone, and I'll just start there, we believe there are around 2m people who have orthodontic treatment every year, and this is a conservative number. We've seen estimates as high as 2.5m or 3m. Subtracting from that 2m the children with immature dentition along with highly complex cases and we're looking at a market opportunity of about 800,000 new case starts. Last year, we sold 44,400 cases into the orthodontic offices --- into the channel where there is an opportunity today to treat 800,000 patients. That's barely 6% of our existing conservative market opportunity. That's just a start. Look beyond this existing opportunity to the GP dentist market and the 100m plus people that see their dentist regularly. I won't go into this market size discussion in any more detail, however, it's well addressed in all of our presentations on the web and is also explained in our annual report. The point isthere is still a big market out there that we have barely tapped. It's up to us to find a way to best increase our market penetration.
 
Before Eldon dives into the financials, I'd like to make some comments about our financial presentation of results. We have a clear path in order to achieving a true GAAP profit. We believe we're operating in a prudent manner so that we can deliver the greatest value to our shareholder. In the past, we've always presented non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation and restructuring. We'll start to move away from that presentation as stock-based compensation diminishes on the anniversary of our IPO in 2005. Remember, many public companies must reconcile the difference between the fair market value of options granted, before the IPO, and the grant price, and amortize that over the vesting period of options. For Align, the amortization period concludes on the four-year anniversary of the IPO, which will be in January 2005. I expect that during future earnings calls, we will provide more emphasis on GAAP financials along with the non-GAAP bottom line. I wanted to let you know this in order to get you ready for that event and structure your models accordingly. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Eldon Bullington, our CFO. After Eldon goes through our financials and our guidance for the second quarter of 2004 along with the full-year 2004, we will take some questions. Eldon?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Thanks Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. As a quick reminder, our first quarter press release and 8-K filing of the same document are available on our Web site. As Tom mentioned, we look to start placing more emphasis on our GAAP financial presentation on future calls. For now, I'll give you the GAAP numbers, stock-based compensation, and then the math required to
 
arrive at the non-GAAP financials. We also want to make sure that you understand that the comparisons to previous guidance we've given, as much of that has been guidance on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP financial table, and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials is still included in our press release. Additionally, we will continue to provide historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial tables on our Investor Relations web site under financial history. Let me move on now to our financials.
 
First, Q1 revenues as Tom mentioned were $39.2m, up 7.4% from last quarter, and 70.8% from the same period a year-ago.
 
First quarter revenues by segment were $21.5m for US ortho, $12.6m for US GP, and $3.5m for international. These channels represent 55%, 32%, and 9% of revenues respectively. Worldwide training and other revenues were $1.5m.
 
GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of 2004 was $25.8m, or 65.8% of revenue compared to $23.6m, or 64.6% of revenues last quarter. This also compares to a gross profit of $11m, or 48.1% of revenues for the first quarter of 2003. Included in cost of revenues for Q1 was approximately $400,000 of stock-based compensation. To arrive at non-GAAP gross profit and margins, we add back the $400,000 of stock-based comp. Non-GAAP gross profit for the first quarter was $26.2m, or 66.9% of revenue. The increase in gross margin which was higher than our expectations is primarily attributable to slightly higher ASPs, or Average Selling Prices, and continued manufacturing process efficiencies in both our treatment operations facility in Costa Rica, and the aligner fabrication process. As Tom mentioned, we introduced additional automation enabling more efficient handling of aligners through the fabrication stages of our manufacturing process.
 
Operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $24.9m for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. This compares to $23.1m for the fourth quarter of 2003, and $21.5m for the same quarter one year ago. Q1 operating expense includes approximately $1.8m of stock-based compensation. Excluding the $1.8m of stock-based comp, we arrive at non-GAAP operating expenses of $23.1m. Operating expense in the first quarter included a $400,000 one-time charge for termination of a regional distribution agreement in Europe.
 
GAAP net profit for the first quarter was $557,000, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net profit of $452,000, or $0.01 per basic and dilute share of last quarter, and a loss of $10.7m, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share in the same period one year ago.
 
Total stock-based compensation for the first quarter was $2.2m. Excluding this, we arrive at first quarter non-GAAP net profit of $2.8m, or $0.05 per basic, and $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net profit of $3.5m or $0.06 per basic, and $0.05 per diluted share for Q4 2003, and a loss of $5.9m or $0.10 per basic and diluted share in Q1 of 2003.
 
A quick note on the top and bottom line performances related to the case refinement restatement we announced in July of 2003. Restatement contributed $1.9m of revenue and associated income in the first quarter of 2004. Again, a full non-GAAP income statement and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials is available on our press release.
 
Now, on to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of Q1 of 2004 was $48.2m, compared to $47.7m at the end of 2003 yielding a positive cash contribution of approximately $0.5m. Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year includes a number of annual cash expenditures. Despite the seasonal pressure on first quarter cash flow, we are pleased with our cash position and asset management, including DSOs or day sales outstanding and receivables of approximately 57 days.
 
Now, let's spend just a few minutes on the second quarter and review our guidance for full year 2004 and 2005. Again, I'll first provide GAAP guidance and a reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance for your comparison purposes. Q2 revenues are projected to be in the range of $41.5m to $43.5m. Ortho channel, GP channel, and international are expected to comprise approximately 51%, 34%, and 10% of Q2 revenues respectively. The remaining 5% approximates training and ancillary product revenues. Case shipment volumes are projected to be in the range of 23,700 to 24,900 cases. Our Q2 revenue projection includes approximately $1.2m of impact from the case refinement restatement we announced last July, and also reflects ASPs of just over $1600. Q2 gross margins on a GAAP basis are projected to be in the 66% to 67% range. We project that gross margins will include approximately $400,000 of stock based compensation charged to cost of revenues. Taking this into consideration, non-GAAP gross margins are projected to be in the range of 67% to 68%.
 
Operating expenses on a GAAP basis are projected to be in the $25.5m to $26.5m range for Q2. Operating expense will include approximately $1.6m in stock based comp. Excluding this we would arrive at non-GAAP operating expenses of $23.9m to $24.9m.
 
GAAP net profit is projected to be in the range of $1.5m to $3.5m. Taking into account the stock based compensation amounts I just discussed, non-GAAP bottom line performance is expected to be a profit in the range of $3.5m to 5.5m.
 
Let me turn to guidance for full year 2004 for a couple of minutes. We expect revenues in the range of $165m to $175m. This is an increase of $5m from the guidance we provided on our January call. The orthodontist channel, GP channel, and international channel are expected to comprise 49%, 36%, and 10% of 2004 revenues respectively with the remaining 5% approximating training and ancillary revenues. Case volume for the year is projected to be in the range of 96,000 to 102,000 cases. Full year
 
revenue projection also includes approximately a $5m impact for the case refinement restatement we announced last July.
 
Full year GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 66% and 68%, again an increase from previous guidance. Cost of revenues will include approximately $1m in stock based compensation; adding this back we arrive at non-GAAP gross margin guidance of 66.6% to 68.6%. Again that's 66.6% to 68.6%.
 
Full-year operating expense guidance on a GAAP basis remains constant at a range of $104.1m to $107.6m. Though revenues are increasing, operating expense guidance remains constant due to the decrease in stock- based compensation projections. Stock-based compensation included in operating expenses for 2004 is projected to be approximately $4.9m. Again, excluding stock-based compensation, we arrive at non-GAAP full-year operating expense guidance of $99.2m to $102.7m.
 
We project full-year GAAP net profit in the range of $4m to $10m. Full-year non-GAAP net profit is projected to be in the range of $10m to $16m. Additionally, GAAP EPS for 2004 is expected to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.15, while non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.24.
 
Let me move on to the balance sheet projections for 2004. As we said last quarter we believe there may be quarter-to-quarter cash utilization fluctuations. At the end of the year however, we expect that our total cash contribution to the business will be neutral, but slightly positive. With that said, cash balances at year-end 2004 are estimated to be in the range in $47m to $50m. Day sales outstanding are expected to average in the range of 56 days to 58 days. We project capital expenditures in the range of $10m to $12m for the year. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the $10m to $11m range for full-year 2004.
 
For 2005, revenues are estimated to be in the range of $220m to $240m. GAAP gross margin are estimated to be up to 70%. GAAP net income for 2005 is estimated to be up to 16% of sales. GAAP net income includes approximately $1m non-cash stock-based compensation, basically that charge will be complete in the first quarter of 2005. Now, we'll take some questions. Operator.

Ed Shenkan -
Wells Fargo SecuritiesAnalyst
 
Hi, good morning gentlemen. I want to ask a question broadly about the industry and what you're seeing. Would you see any either braces manufactures or new competitors that you expect to introduce similar products to Invisalign in the upcoming years or three years? And similarly could it make strategic sense for Invisalign to merge with any braces manufacturers and increase distribution?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Thanks for the softball question Ed. I guess the first statement I will make is to your second question. This wouldn't be the time or place for us talk about broader strategic initiatives, anything on the M&A side. But let me say in general we believe we got competition all over the place. We try to act it like everyday, and we've got a large fire under us in terms of creating a sense of urgency. There are a range of choices for clinicians today to straighten teeth, and there are very good products out there in the marketplace for them to use and, so we have to work very hard to make sure that our value proposition for the doc and the patient are superior to what everyone else can bring to the market. Beyond competing for those case starts, we are competing for the attention of non-consumers in the marketplace for whom conventional braces and brackets don't meet their needs or potential may not meet their needs, and so we are trying to get to  we're trying to get to the point where we can attract people that wouldn't even think about getting braces to get their teeth straightening the Invisalign way. All that said, we've got  we believe are very strong fresh intellectual property, as well as tremendous manufacturing and technology competencies that would make it difficult to follow us in the courts, or in the real world. And, anybody who should say what we are doing today is, going to probably be late by the time they get there anyway. Yeah we worry
 
a lot about competition Ed. Yes, it's the nature of the competitive marketplace, but we believe we are prepared for. And again, I'm not going to comment the second issue at this point.
 
Ed Shenkan -
Wells Fargo SecuritiesAnalyst
 
Thank you. As a follow-up. Physicians more eager to try Invisalign than doctors who haven't tried it previously, now in a year ago. Is the introduction from the second or third patient to the 50th patient, is it accelerating, can you talk a little about that? Thank you.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Maybe there is two dimension to that, I think as Eldon talked about a little bit, we are not going to provide any granularity here. But we did see utilization same practice case starts go up in the ortho channel at a significant level. And that's actually a good sign to say that the people are starting to accelerate their practice there. Anecdotally or quantitatively, and we actually provide detail there, but anecdotally, we do feel that there are some clinicians who perhaps didn't have the best experience with the products early on, that have come back, and have had some good results and have been able to create some very good clinical results for patients. So, I think it's a hard one to answer. We are going to get lots of feedback in the next week or so. We are about to go up to the American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, the annual meeting. And its always an intense week, and we get lots of feedback, and lots of good ideas about from our doc. So, I'll be ready to answer this more concretely maybe on the next call.

Our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy. Please proceed with your question.

Hi guys, this is Tao.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Hi Tao.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Just can you speak of a quick numbers for me which I missed  orders received in the quarter?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
New cases received were  we had 23,700 net new cases received in Q1.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche Bank

Analyst
 
And the average cases per business?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
376.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Great, thanks. In terms of the 04 guidance, you bumped that up by $5m?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Yes.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Yet your shipment volume didn't change, are you looking for higher ASPs, or is there anything going on there?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
I'll let Eldon comment there.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Tao its probably a couple of things. One, I think is doing some true ups in our guidance, for one thing. And two is  as I mentioned, we are seeing a little bit higher ASPs, and part of that is driven by  we are seeing a little bit of an evolution of our mix relative to full large treatments than what we expected. And also, kind of the evolution of our case refinement revenue flow through the business is picking up a little bit quicker than what we had anticipated. So, that is having some uptick on our overall average ASP.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Okay. And if I look at where you guys came out on a channel basis, you are little lower than you are looking for on the orthodontics side, and a little higher on your GP side. Do you think there is any cannibalization possibly going on from the GPs at this point?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Again, maybe we were off in what model you had Dale, but from our perspective, we were right about where we are expected to be from a channel perspective which actually is really good news for us. We think we have pretty good handle on where the levers are in the business. The other question around that whole issue is the cannibalization, not only is there not cannibalization, we think the acceleration in ortho practices is because of working to build this cooperative market model where Ortho's work with GPs in areas that are already referral partners. And as they help them be comfortable doing straightforward simple cases, many people who had not even sought orthodontic treatment, they might be in a dentist office to get your teeth whitened to do some basic restorative. And if the ortho works with GP in a cooperative way, the GPs offices increasing their awareness and knowledge understanding of malocclusion, the chairside support, the hygienist, they are all better able to spot malocclusion and talk to patients and educate them about it. Increasingly, those people are wearing aligners as part of our professional discount program as a front line of education, and those with anything not straightforward and simple are not going to the dentists anyways and we are seeing that happen. So, I think it is just the opposite, many other people, the GPs are doing, we are not seeking orthodontic treatment to begin with.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Okay and then if I could add a couple more and I'll get back in the queue. Your sales and marketing expense went up significantly as you guys had mentioned in prior conference calls. What type of payback, when do we see the payback on the significant investment that you are currently making?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
So really sales and marketing is really two fold. One component is a slight uptick in advertising, and we are  and so when we increase consumer marketing, several things come along with that. One, we increase direct-to-consumer program both direct mail and TV spots and fulfillment and along with that comes kind of a kind of linear increase in call center costs. So, as we step up or increment up direct-to-consumer promotion, there is a couple of piece that come along with it. The second part of that is program spending, we have substantially stepped up our clinical education efforts. We are expanding the number, the types and we believe substantially the quality of the workshops, study clubs, professional training environments the clear feedback from all our clinicians is this brings tremendous value to them. So, we see pay back from direct-to-consumer programs within a quarter or two as leads turn into cases. We generally see a pay back range from a quarter to three quarters in education initiatives, and we track and measure those very carefully at a single practice level for the people who have participated. The third piece of this is some expansion of sales force which we forecasted and talked about, and the money we are spending on the increases in marketing and sales in Q1, and the direction we given for OPEX in general for the year are very much consistent with what we talked about in Q4 when we did the year-end release. So, we are right on where we said we are going to be in terms of incrementing up spending in two key areas. One, sales and marketing to build the business, grow the topline, get better results, and two, on the R&D and technology development side where we are substantially increasing the leverage on automation systems, all those other sort of things. So, we are actually right about where  Eldon talked about a one-time cost we had, but we are right about where we expected to be in terms of controllable OPEX or operating expense.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Okay great. Thanks a lot, and just one final one. In terms of your guidance for 04 on EPS front Eldon, what is the tax rate that you are using if any in the $0.15 to $0.24?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Tao, consistent with what we talked about in the past, the taxes that are flowing through our income statements this year are pretty much just residuals for some foreign tax and some local tax. We have not recorded the roll over to a reserve on the books type of accounting model. So, it was $133,000 of tax charged to the P&L for Q1, and that's not going to be dramatically out of line with the relative dollars charge through time. It is not as much as a percent of operating income, it is just where we have to pay residual foreign taxes this year. We are not providing at this point in time for state or federal against our NOLs.
 
Tao Levy
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
 
Okay.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -

Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder if you wish to register a question please press the one followed by the four on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Delaney of Entrust.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Good gentlemen and congratulations on the quarter.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
I am sorry.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Hello. Operator. Do have one or two question in, please?
 
Operator
 
I am very sorry. My microphone was still open, terribly sorry.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Thank you. Please continue Brian.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
I am sorry. In terms of the training of the GP the 700 GP that you trained in the quarter, how does that compare to kind of what your internal forecasts were, and is that still then on track for the 5000 plus for this year?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
We have typically  well let me answer the broader question first Brian. We have typically have said we will do 4000 to 5000 and the thing is a little closer to four just in doability. We traditionally have a slower start in certifications in Q1 just because you enroll them typically the quarter before and that's the holidays and we really didn't do our first certification of the year until very late January, early February. The rate of certifications is right where we ought to be, and we are forecasting a little about 700, but not by a lot. We didn't expect a huge number in Q1. We were very comfortable that we will do 4000 or thereabouts for the year and that is kind of our game plan.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
So forth to  okay. So, if I look at kind of last couple of years it was running 5000, how should I think about why  it is just a capacity issue in terms of not being able to do more than 4000 and going back to the kind of historical levels of GPs trained?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
So, we've always talked about kind of up to 5000 as an upper bound and there is a reason it's an upper bound  I mean we could put an awful lot more bodies in hotel rooms on Friday and Saturdays all over the country, but there is a practical learning here that has occurred that says there is a whole system approach. It starts with pre-work before the certification where the field team actually contacts and sets the right expectations, does some front-end learning. They bring their pre-work to the certifications; there is an intensive session at certification. There is a fast start program that occurs after the certification and so capacity kind of writ large is company capability to properly train them, support them, get them started, make sure they get great results. At some level if we had, you know, two times the number of people in the field, if we had more clinical support resources, broader on line  I mean if the whole thing was scaled up, we might dial that up more. But we're very comfortable where we are. Our principal goal is to get the right docs into chairs, have them trained in a professional manner, so that they're very pumped up when they go back and then have them most importantly getting great results for patients. And I think, the numbers 4000 and above, we've have been around that number and in the last couple of years, I think the number approximately was around 4100 for all of 03. So, again, we've said around 5000 or up to about 5000, but that depends what you said about four.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay. I mean my concern was that it's not just a lack of demand, as you know, the demand still out there for the number of GP that you haven't trained. So, the trend I'm seeing is a function of what you're talking about? I mean that's what I was trying to focus on?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Yes. We've got about 7% of the GP population out there, that do the business certification.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Thanks and then just a clarification on the case refinement. You said that the contribution was $5m and associated income, so in your EPS guidance, is there $5m  I should assume it's a 100% margin this restatement that all drops to the bottom line?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
For the most part.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay, So, can you help me then, if I were to move the benefit you have in your guidance this year for EPS and then bridge me to kind of what the EPS guidance is for 05? Except it's a huge ramp after I take out what was case refinement benefit?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Brian, we view case refinement as an ongoing part of our revenue and basically the way that process works, case refinement for one case has included in our pricing and we defer that and recognize it in one or two points either when the refinement is actually shipped or if the case concludes and the refinement is never requested by the clinician, or if beyond the first refinement is included, clinicians can buy additional cases that we don't view that as an adjunct to our business is part of our business and part of our normal revenue flow. So, we don't include it or exclude it or view it as an extraordinary item, so I don't view the business that way and I don't see the value in analyzing it that way.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay and I was just trying to say my impression was that this was a restatement that will impact 05 but then going forward it will no longer be a contributor. So, I was just trying to bridge from where you are in terms of bound line guidance this year to next year, and I guess my assumption was that it was like a case refinement benefit we had this year wasn't going to repeat itself in 05? And maybe that was wrong on my part.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Okay or maybe I didn't completely understand your question, if you're relating to the revenue restatement numbers that we talked about then that's an issue that is pretty much done in 2004 and you would not carry forward other than just a very small residual amount in 2005. So, if I misunderstood your question, I apologize. Case refinement and the restatement are two completely different things.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay and then I guess  maybe I missed on something on the restatement portion  how much was the contribution for the restatement in 04?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
It's $5m.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay. So we're talking about the same thing. Okay, thank you very much.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
And to your point, that basically falls straight through.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay and it will not recur in 05?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
That's correct.
 
Brian Delaney -
Entrust
 
Okay. Alright. Thank you very much and keep up the good work.

Our next question comes from the line of Mary Ishanti of A.H. Ishanti Capital Growth.
 
Mary Ishanti -
A. H. Ishanti Capital GrowthAnalyst
 
Thank you. Good morning, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the marketing partnerships you negotiated with Care Credit and sort of, you know, how long you have had it, and what your doctors might be seeing in terms of is there increased interest or are they being more aggressive with the product now that they have the opportunity to get paid upfront on the product.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Well, you know, I guess, never want it. It's very new. We have been working for the last year to year and a half on a whole range of alternatives that, you know, we don't want to be the Bank and traditionally orthodontists were the Banks. They basically set for a flat price, I will charge you X and I won't pay your interest  I won't charge you interest and what they were basically doing was leveraging their, in a sense, financing their time because their running costs were not as high as they are under this line. In this line it's little bit of reverse troop. The doc has more costs upfront as they pay our fee roughly six months into the process, and so they have been more driven on a cash basis to [Inaudible] collect a little more upfront of $1000, $1500, or $2000. For some patients, that's just too much money to put upfront and  versus pay $250 to $500. What this allows them to do and this is a change for orthodontists, not all orthodontists want to do this, some that have significant expansion going on in their practices, in effect it takes the pressure of working capital for them, and they are really jumping on this, because they find if they have gone from say 10 cases a year to 50 or 75 cases a year, they can easily get out of this step with the cash flow that are actually coming in from the patient over time. So, this allows them especially during those periods of expansion, at a very low rate, where we effectively brokered interest rate, in effect helped the financing companies see the size and desirability opportunity and a very good credit list in all of these, you know, wealthy practitioners represented and we can't put buyer and seller together and help create a program. And so, what I would say is it is very early for me talk about broad trends, but we think this can both be important at dentist's office, the GP as well as the orthodontist, and again it allows them to overcome one of the key questions setting at cheer side for the patient where, boy! that's a lot of money  I don't know if I dropped with $1000 to start or $1500, they can basically say you can get $30 today with almost no down payment, you can basically pay in a year, and then take a year after that to pay over, you know, 12 payments. As there are no financial implications for our line we are not guaranteeing anything, we have no reserves, there is no  we are not backing it by the appearance, so you know, it's just us helping our docs broaden their practice, have better offerings, and hit a part of the market that they may have been missing.

How long is the agreement? Is there an initial term for the agreement or is it just sort of indefinitely or does the financing company have the ability to re-examine it at some point?
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Yes, there is no actually no agreement between Care Credit and Align, there is no financial relationship, there is no contract with us. What we did, we did program development, we haven't found best in class companies that could do  there is  we've been working like this for about a year, a year and a half. And what we really thought was we considered should Align do this, should Align create an offering here? And we get back and say, we are not a financing company, we don't have a cost of capital and our balance sheet structure and everything else that would make sense for that. So  but we are now looking for people that understood Healthcare and loaning  working with doctors for patient based financing, that will use their professional practice environment, single office environment. So, we act as a facilitator, developed a program of care credits, tuned it up for orthodontists and GPs and roll it out to our customers and it's doing pretty well for just being a starter, so maybe I wasn't very clear, there is no agreement to stay with us and it's a business development for them and facilitation for us.

Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to queue operate question, please press the one followed by the four on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche BankAnalyst
 
Hi guys. Just a couple of clarifications. Eldon, what was the net profit non-GAAP that you are guiding for the full year 04?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Okay Tao, for the full year GAAP  for full year 2004, our GAAP net profit was about $10m and our full year non-GAAP net profit for 2004 projected in the range of $10m to $16m.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche BankAnalyst
 
Okay and that compares to the last quarter, do you remember what your guidance was last quarter, just five and a half to 12.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Correct?
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
That's correct. So yes, that's correct I guess. So you see there is a $4m to $5m uptick there from our  our guidance last quarter.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche BankAnalyst
 
Okay and what is it for  for 05, the net profit non-GAAP? And I apologize I can't write as quick as I probably should.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
Not a problem. Glad to help. For 2005, basically what we talked about and what I said and I gave it in percentages. So, I will give you the pieces again. For 2005, what I quoted a few moments ago was a revenue range of $220m to $240m and a GAAP gross margin of up to 70% and a GAAP net income of up to 16%, and included in that the stock drops to a small number of $1m. So in terms of converting that to a non-GAAP bottom line, now let's do the math.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche BankAnalyst
 
Perfect and I guess as was the thing with last quarter, you didn't change your 05 revenue guidance, and I assume that you are just waiting for some more visibility. I don't know how this year goes.
 
Eldon M. Bullington -
Align TechnologyVice President, Finance and CFO
 
On our call last quarter, the revenue guidance is the same. What our bottom line guidance was, we gave a range of 10% to 16%.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Right you tightened that up to 16.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
Right I am saying up to 16.
 
Tao Levy -
Deutsche BankAnalyst
 
Great. On the revenue line, when do you feel comfortable in 04 to possibly start adjust or maybe  maybe move up the 05 revenue guidance.
 
Thomas M. Prescott -
Align TechnologyPresident, CEO
 
It is still early in the year. As we said a year ago on the  I can't answer that question absolutely. But as we see the year go on and we understand the run rate and the dynamics of the business will  you know we will  if there is any difference in the view we have got out there, we are obligated to talk about it. It is early for me to say when and I don't know if it will be this time next quarter, perhaps third quarter. Certainly by the fourth quarter we will be able to  you know if there is a change. But you know we are  we are going to talk about it as soon as we can.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2004. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2004 were $44.2 million, compared to $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 13 percent, and $29.2 million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 51 percent. "We are pleased with our results for the second quarter," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "Our marketing and sales initiatives are gaining traction and have led to increased case shipments and revenues. Our operating margins continue to improve and have begun to demonstrate the leverage in our business model. We are committed to providing a quality product for our customers and helping them achieve great results for their patients. This commitment to their success, along with consistent financial performance, and our long-term goal of becoming the most important part of our doctors' practices, will help us build a great company that delivers shareholder value." The net profit for the second quarter of 2004 as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") was $3.8 million, or earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.06.

We believe that our non-GAAP net profit (loss) gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net profit (loss) is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net profit (loss) prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

The United States District Court for the Central District, Southern Division, granted Align's motion for summary judgment of invalidity of Ormco's patents (the Court ruled earlier this year that Align does not infringe these patents). As Ormco's patents were found invalid by the Court, this provides Align additional freedom to operate in the field of digital dentistry. The Court also denied Ormco's summary judgment motion seeking a finding of invalidity of Align's patents (Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611). Align is represented by intellectual property specialty firm, Townsend and Townsend and Crew LLP. "This third summary judgment against Ormco is a testament to the lack of any basis for Ormco's suit against us," said Thomas M. Prescott, President and CEO of Align Technology, Inc. "We believe the successful defense of our intellectual property, along with the more than fifty patents issued and numerous patent applications pending will enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. Align will continue to invest in the technology and processes that make Invisalign an important part of our customers' practices and the most attractive way for consumers to gain a better smile." About Align Technology, Inc. Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

Exhibit 99.1 Align Technology, Inc. Reports 9th Consecutive Quarter of Increasing Revenues - Third Quarter Revenues Increase 35% Year Over Year to $45.8 Million - Company Reports GAAP Net Profit of $3.3 Million, or EPS of $0.05, and Non-GAAP Net Profit of $4.7 Million, or EPS of $0.07 - Company Increases Cash Position by $16.3 Million Year-to-Date SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2004. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2004 were $45.8 million, compared to $34.0 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 34.5 percent, and $44.2 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 3.5 percent. "We are pleased with our earnings this quarter," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "As we continue building the company, we look forward to strengthening the infrastructure and positioning Align for long-term growth and profitability. Additionally, we believe that year-over-year, revenues will grow by introducing several strategic initiatives including an expanded sales force, enhanced consumer marketing programs and the introduction of new products. " The net profit for the third quarter of 2004 as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") was $3.3 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.05. This compares to a net loss for the third quarter of 2003 of $2.1 million, or a net loss of $0.04 per share, and a net profit for the second quarter of 2004 of $3.8 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.06. Third quarter 2004 profit includes a $1.1 million severance charge related to the previously announced departure of an executive. The non-GAAP net profit for the third quarter of 2004, which excludes $1.4 million of stock-based compensation, was $4.7 million, or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.07. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2003, which excludes $3.4 million of stock-based compensation charges, or a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.02. This also compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, which excludes $1.8 million of stock-based compensation, or a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.09. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net profit for the third quarter of 2004 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements. As of September 30, 2004, Align had $64.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $47.7 million as of December 31, 2003.

We believe that our non-GAAP net profit (loss) gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net profit (loss) is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $43.7 million, compared to $45.8 million in the third quarter of 2004, a decrease of 4.6 percent, and $36.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 19.6 percent. For fiscal year 2004, Align reported revenues of $172.8 million, compared to $122.7 million for fiscal year 2003, an increase of 40.8 percent. On December 9, 2004, the Company announced a change to its case refinement policy that had a one-time effect on fourth quarter 2004 revenues and associated costs. The impact of this policy change was a decrease in revenues of $1.9 million. The bottom-line impact to GAAP and non-GAAP net profit was a decrease of $1.9 million. "We are pleased with our results for 2004," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "We are in the process of executing on a multi-year strategy to ensure the people, processes and systems are in place to build a great company. We have taken steps to help doctors confidently recommend Invisalign to their patients and to become the treatment that patients will request. We expect 2005 to be a year in which we continue building a business that is primed for future growth." The net profit for the fourth quarter of 2004 as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") was $1.5 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.02. This compares to net profit of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2004, or EPS of $0.05 per diluted share, and a net profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 of $452 thousand, or EPS of $0.01 per diluted share. For fiscal year 2004, the net profit was $9.2 million, or EPS of $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $20.1 million for fiscal year 2003, or a net loss of $0.35 per diluted share. The non-GAAP net profit for the fourth quarter of 2004, which excludes $214 thousand of stock-based compensation, was $1.7 million, or EPS of $0.03 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2004, which excludes $1.4 million of stock-based compensation, or non-GAAP EPS of $0.07 per diluted share. This also compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, which excludes $3.0 million of stock-based compensation, or non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 per diluted share. For the fiscal year 2004, the non-GAAP net profit, which excludes $5.6 million of stock-based compensation, was $14.8 million, or non- GAAP EPS of $0.23 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $4.6 million for fiscal year 2003, which excludes $15.0 million of stock-based compensation and $507 thousand of restructuring charges, or a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per diluted share. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net loss for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2004 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, Align had $70.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to $47.7 million as of December 31, 2003.

ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Amendment to Credit Agreement
 
On January 28, 2005, Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company") and Comerica Bank entered into Amendment No. 4 (the "Amendment") to the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 20, 2002, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of August 4, 2003, and Amendment No. 2, dated as of September 29, 2003 and Amendment No. 3 dated as of December 17, 2003. The Amendment amends Section 6.7(c) for the purpose of changing the minimum EBITDA amount for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 from $5,000,000 to $3,000,000.
 
A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference.
 
ITEM 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
This Fourth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the "Amendment") is entered into as of January 28, 2005, by and between COMERICA BANK ("Bank") and ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. ("Borrower").
 
 
Borrower and Bank are parties to that certain Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 20, 2002, (as amended from time to time, including without limitation that certain Amendment No. 1 to Loan and Security Agreement with Limited Waiver dated as of August 4, 2003, that certain Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 29, 2003, and that certain Amendment No. 3 to Loan and Security Agreement dated December 17, 2003, together with any related agreements, the "Agreement"). Hereinafter, all indebtedness owing by Borrower to Bank shall be referred to as the "Indebtedness." The parties desire to amend the Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Amendment.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The parties prefer that any dispute between them be resolved in litigation subject to a Jury Trial Waiver as set forth in the Loan Documents (defined below), but the availability of that process is in doubt because of the opinion of the California Court of Appeal in Grafton Partners LP v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.Rptr.3d 511. This Reference Provision will be applicable until the California Supreme Court completes its review of that case, and will continue to be applicable if either that court or a California Court of Appeal publishes a decision holding that a pre-dispute Jury Trial Waiver provision similar to that contained in the Loan Documents is invalid or unenforceable. Delay in requesting appointment of a referee pending review of any such decision, or participation in litigation pending review, will not be deemed a waiver of this Reference Provision.
 
Other than (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of security interests in real or personal property, (ii) the appointment of a receiver or (iii) the exercise of other provisional remedies (any of which may be initiated pursuant to applicable law), any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a "Claim") between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement between the Bank and the undersigned (collectively in this Section, the "Loan Documents"), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Section 638 . of the California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the Superior Court or Federal District Court in the County or District where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the "Court").
et seq
 
The referee shall be a retired Judge or Justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if relief is not granted. The referee shall be appointed to sit with all the powers provided by law. Each party shall have one peremptory challenge pursuant to CCP 170.6. Pending appointment of the referee, the Court has power to issue temporary or provisional remedies.
ex parte
ex parte
 
The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested to (a) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (b) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within ninety (90) days after the date of the conference and (c) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision. Any decision rendered by the referee will be final, binding and conclusive, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to CCP 644.
 
The referee will have power to expand or limit the amount and duration of discovery. The referee may set or extend discovery deadlines or cutoffs for good cause, including a party's failure to provide requested discovery for any reason whatsoever. Unless otherwise ordered, no party shall be entitled to "priority" in conducting discovery, depositions may be taken by either
 
party upon seven (7) days written notice, and all other discovery shall be responded to within fifteen (15) days after service. All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding.
 
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the referee shall determine the manner in which the reference proceeding is conducted including the time and place of hearings, the order of presentation of evidence, and all other questions that arise with respect to the course of the reference proceeding. All proceedings and hearings conducted before the referee, except for trial, shall be conducted without a court reporter, except that when any party so requests, a court reporter will be used at any hearing conducted before the referee, and the referee will be provided a courtesy copy of the transcript. The party making such a request shall have the obligation to arrange for and pay the court reporter. Subject to the referee's power to award costs to the prevailing party, the parties will equally share the cost of the referee and the court reporter at trial.
 
The referee shall be required to determine all issues in accordance with existing case law and the statutory laws of the State of California. The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, provide all temporary or provisional remedies, enter equitable orders that will be binding on the parties and rule on any motion which would be authorized in a trial, including without limitation motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication . The referee shall issue a decision at the close of the reference proceeding which disposes of all claims of the parties that are the subject of the reference. The referee's decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court. The parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee. The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision.
 
If the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or Justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act 1280 through 1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time. The limitations with respect to discovery set forth above shall apply to any such arbitration proceeding.
 
THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES RESOLVED UNDER THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL BE DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY, AND THAT THEY ARE IN EFFECT WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN AGREEING TO THIS REFERENCE PROVISION. AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF THEIR OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND FOR THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM WHICH ARISES OUT OF OR IS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE LOAN DOCUMENTS."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Amendment as of the first date above written.

Exhibit 99.1 ALIGN TECHNOLOGY FILES LAWSUIT SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today filed a multi-claim lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against defendants OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc., Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Bao Tran, Peter Riepenhausen, Joe Breeland, Jeff Tunnell, Christopher Kawaja, and Charles Wen. Among other things, the lawsuit alleges tortious and illegal actions arising out of defendants' plan to unlawfully utilize Align's intellectual property, confidential information and employees. In addition, the lawsuit alleges that OrthoClear, Mr. Chishti and the persons named above are in breach of contractual obligations, statutory law, and common law, for the purpose of attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt Align's on-going operations and improperly gain access to Align's customer relationships and trade secrets. "We will take all necessary actions to protect Align's vital corporate assets and technology leadership on behalf of our shareholders," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "The success of Invisalign is not easily replicated. Our leading market position is the product of substantial investment and many years of extensive research and development. We intend to vigorously enforce all of our legal rights." By its Complaint, Align seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be determined. About Align Technology, Inc.

EXHIBIT 10.1 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT This AGREEMENT is entered into as of February 7, 2005, by and between Rok Sribar (the "Executive") and Align Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 1. Duties and Scope of Employment. (a) Position. For the term of his employment under this Agreement ("Employment"), the Company agrees to employ the Executive in the position of Vice President, R&D. The Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive accepts such employment and agrees to discharge all of the duties normally associated with said position, and to faithfully and to the best of his abilities perform such other services consistent with his position as Vice President, R&D as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"). (b) Obligations to the Company. During the term of his Employment, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the CEO, provided, however, that the Executive may, without the approval of the CEO, serve in any capacity with any civic, educational or charitable organization. The Executive may own, as a passive investor, no more than one percent (1%) of any class of the outstanding securities of any publicly traded corporation. (c) No Conflicting Obligations. The Executive represents and warrants to the Company that he is under no obligations or commitments, whether contractual or otherwise, that are inconsistent with his obligations under this Agreement. The Executive represents and warrants that he will not use or disclose, in connection with his employment by the Company, any trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property in which the Executive or any other person has any right, title or interest and that his employment by the Company as contemplated by this Agreement will not infringe or violate the rights of any other person or entity. The Executive represents and warrants to the Company that he has returned all property and confidential information belonging to any prior employers. (d) Commencement Date. The Executive commenced full-time Employment on February 7, 2005. 2. Cash and Incentive Compensation. (a) Salary. The Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for his services a base salary at a gross annual rate of $226,000, payable in accordance with the Company's standard payroll schedule. The compensation specified in this Subsection (a), together with any adjustments by the Company from time to time, is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Salary."
(b) Target Bonus. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in an annual bonus program that will provide him with an opportunity to earn a potential annual bonus equal to 60.0% of the Executive's Base Salary. The amount of the bonus shall be based upon the performance of the Executive, as set by the individual performance objectives described in this Subsection, and the Company in each calendar year, and shall be paid by no later than January 31 of the following year, contingent on the Executive remaining employed by the Company as of such date. The Executive's individual performance objectives and those of the Company's shall be set by the CEO after consultation with the Executive by no later than March 31, of each calendar year. For calendar year 2005, the Executive's bonus shall be prorated based on the number of days of such year that the Executive was employed by the Company. Any bonus awarded or paid to the Executive will be subject to the discretion of the Board. (c) Stock Options. The Executive shall be eligible for an annual incentive stock option grant subject to the approval of the Board. The per share exercise price of the option will be equal to the per share fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. The term of such option shall be ten (10) years, subject to earlier expiration in the event of the termination of the Executive's Employment. Such option shall be immediately exercisable, but the purchased shares shall be subject to repurchase by the Company at the exercise price in the event that the Executive's Employment terminates before he vests in the shares. The Executive shall vest in 25% of the option shares after the first twelve (12) months of continuous service and shall vest in the remaining option shares in equal monthly installments over the next three (3) years of continuous service. The grant of each such option shall be subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the Company's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and in the Company's standard form of stock option agreement. 3. Vacation and Executive Benefits. During the term of his Employment, the Executive shall be eligible for 17 days vacation per year, in accordance with the Company's standard policy for senior management, as it may be amended from time to time. During the term of his Employment, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans maintained by the Company for senior management, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determinations of any person or committee administering such plan. 4. Business Expenses. During the term of his Employment, the Executive shall be authorized to incur necessary and reasonable travel, entertainment and other business expenses in connection with his duties hereunder. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for such expenses upon presentation of an itemized account and appropriate supporting documentation, all in accordance with the Company's generally applicable policies. 5. Term of Employment. (a) Basic Rule. The Company agrees to continue the Executive's Employment, and the Executive agrees to remain in Employment with the Company, from the commencement date set forth in Section 1(d) until the date when the Executive's Employment 2

Such arbitration shall be in lieu of any trial before a judge and/or jury, and the Executive and Company expressly waive all rights to have such disputes resolved via trial before a judge and/or jury. Such disputes shall include, without limitation, claims for breach of contract or of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claims of discrimination, claims under any federal, state or local law or regulation now in existence or hereinafter enacted and as amended from time to time concerning in any way the subject of the Executive's employment with the Company or its termination.

With respect to such disputes, they shall not be subject to arbitration; rather, they will be resolved pursuant to applicable law. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"), provided, however, that the arbitrator shall allow the discovery authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1282, et seq., or any other discovery required by applicable law in arbitration proceedings, including, but not limited to, discovery available under the applicable state and/or federal arbitration statutes. Also, to the extent that any of the AAA Rules or anything in this arbitration section conflicts with any arbitration procedures required by applicable law, the arbitration procedures required by applicable law shall govern. 7
Arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California or, if the Executive does not reside within 100 miles of Santa Clara County at the time the dispute arises, then the arbitration may take place in the largest metropolitan area within 50 miles of the Executive's place of residence when the dispute arises. During the course of the arbitration, the Executive and the Company will each bear equally the arbitrator's fee and any other type of expense or cost of arbitration, unless applicable law requires otherwise, and each shall bear their own respective attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator will not have authority to award attorneys' fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. In such case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys' fees as required or permitted by the applicable statute or contract. If there is a dispute as to whether the Executive or the Company is the prevailing party in the arbitration, the arbitrator will decide this issue. The arbitrator shall issue a written award that sets forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief authorized by law in connection with the asserted claims or disputes. The arbitrator's award shall be subject to correction, confirmation, or vacation, as provided by applicable law setting forth the standard of judicial review of arbitration awards. Judgment upon the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. (h) No Assignment. This Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Executive hereunder are personal to the Executive and may not be transferred or assigned by the Executive at any time. The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that assumes the Company's obligations hereunder in connection with any sale or transfer of all or a substantial portion of the Company's assets to such entity. (i) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 8
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has executed this Agreement, in the case of the Company by its duly authorized officer, as of the day and year first above written.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE is made as of the 4th day of February, 2005, by and between JAMES S. LINDSEY, a resident of the State of California ("Lessor"), and ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Lessee"), with reference to the following facts and objectives:
 
A. Lessor and Lessee entered that certain Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease-Modified Net and Addendum thereto (collectively, the "Lease") both dated June 20, 2000 with respect to the approximately 55,913-square foot building (the "881 Building") located at 881 Martin Avenue in the City of Santa Clara, County of Santa Clara, State of California.
 
B. Lessor and Lessee mutually desire to extend the Original Term of the Lease and otherwise modify the terms and conditions of the Lease as provided in this First Amendment.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1. The Original Term is hereby extended for a period of five (5) additional years. The Expiration Date shall therefore be June 30, 2010.
 
2. Paragraph 49 of the Lease is hereby amended by adding the following dates and amounts thereto:
 
 
3. Lessee has previously paid to Lessor, and Lessor currently holds, the Security Deposit in the amount of One Million Two Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($1,269,000). Commencing July 1, 2005, and continuing as of the first day of each calendar month thereafter through and including June 1, 2010, Lessor shall deduct Ten Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-Five Dollars ($10,575) from the Security Deposit and apply such amount against Base Rent due for such
month. Accordingly, notwithstanding Section 2 above, from and after July 1, 2005, Lessee shall only be required to pay Lessor monthly Base Rent as follows:
 
 
4. Each monthly deduction from the Security Deposit under Section 3 above shall permanently reduce the amount of the Security Deposit, and Lessee shall have no obligation to restore the Security Deposit to any prior amount. Accordingly, as of the June 30, 2010 Expiration Date, the Security Deposit will equal Six Hundred Thirty-Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($634,500).
 
5. Lessee shall retain the option to extend the Term as provided in Paragraph 64 of the Lease, except that (i) the five (5)-year "extended term" described therein shall commence as of July 1, 2010 (i.e., as of the expiration of the Original Term as extended by this First Amendment), and (ii) "three percent (3%)" shall be substituted for "four percent (4%)". In addition, Lessee shall only have the right to exercise such extension option if Lessee also exercises any similar options to extend the terms of any other leases between Lessor and Lessee regarding space then occupied by Lessee in the building located at 801-851 Martin Avenue (including, without limitation, the 801 Space, if Lessee exercises the Expansion Option described in Section 6 below).
 
6. Lessor hereby grants Lessee the option (the "Expansion Option") to lease the approximately 31,239-square foot space (the "801 Space") commonly known as 801 Martin Avenue in the building located at 801-851 Martin Avenue, City and County of Santa Clara, State of California on the following terms and conditions:
 
(a) Lessor represents that (i) the 801 Space is currently leased to Club One Fitness ("Club One") through June 30, 2007, (ii) Club One initially has an option to extend the term of its current lease (the "Club One Lease") for one additional year through June 30, 2008, and (iii) Club One has a further option to extend the term of the Club One Lease thereafter for an additional five (5) years through June 30, 2013.
 
(b) Lessor further represents that Club One must exercise each such option at least four (4) months prior to the expiration of the then-current term of the Club One Lease. If, therefore, Club One does not exercise its first option to extend the term of the Club One Lease, then Lessee's Expansion Option shall be to lease the 801 Space for a term of three (3) years from July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2010. If Club One exercises its option to extend the Club One Lease through
 
June 30, 2008 but does not exercise its subsequent option to extend the term of the Club One Lease through June 30, 2013, then Lessee's Expansion Option shall be to lease the 801 Space for a term of two (2) years from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2010. If Club One exercises both of its options to extend the term of the Club One Lease through June 30, 2013, then Lessee's Expansion Option shall only be to lease the 801 Space upon any early termination of the Club One Lease and continuing through June 30, 2010. Lessor shall promptly give Lessee written notice of Club One's exercise of each such extension option and of any termination of the Club One Lease. Unless Lessee has previously declined in writing to exercise the Expansion Option, Lessor shall only lease the 801 Space to Club One pursuant to Club One's proper exercise of its existing extension options under the Club One Lease. Lessor shall therefore require Club One's strict compliance with the terms and conditions of the Club One Lease relating to such extension options, and Lessor shall not waive or modify any of the existing terms or conditions of the Club One Lease relating to such extension options.
 
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph 4(b) above, the term of Lessee's lease of the 801 Space shall not commence until such date (the "801 Commencement Date", which date shall be deemed to be the "Commencement Date" with respect to the 801 Space) that both of the following shall have occurred: (i) the Club One Lease shall in fact have terminated, and (ii) Lessor shall have tendered possession of the 801 Space in the condition described in Paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 of the Lease. The 801 Space shall otherwise be in "as is" condition, except as otherwise provided in this First Amendment.
 
(d) If Lessee elects to exercise the Expansion Option, Lessee must give Lessor written notice thereof no later than (i) April 1, 2007, if Club One does not exercise its first extension option, or (ii) April 1, 2008, if Club One exercises its first extension option but does not exercise its second extension option, or (iii) if Club One exercises both of its extension options, thirty (30) days after Lessor notifies Lessee in writing that the Club One Lease has terminated.
 
(e) Lessee's lease of the 801 Space shall be on the same terms and conditions as the Lease, except as otherwise provided herein. Accordingly, as of the 801 Commencement Date (as described in Paragraph 4(c) above), the Premises described in the Lease shall be expanded to include the 801 Space, and the following additional terms and conditions shall apply:
 
(i) From and after such 801 Commencement Date, monthly Base Rent under the Lease shall be increased by the following amounts:
 
 
(ii) Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses shall continue to be 35.8% with respect to Common Area Operating Expenses properly allocable to the Industrial Center in which the original Premises at 881 Martin Avenue are located. The 801 Space, however,
 
is an approximately 31,239-square foot space within a 100,369-square foot building and an approximately 156,282-square foot, two-building project. Accordingly, Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses properly allocable to such building shall equal 31.1%, and Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses properly allocable to such project shall equal 19.99%.
 
(iii) Lessee shall have the use of one hundred twenty-five (125) Unreserved Parking Spaces with respect to the 801 Space.
 
(iv) The option to renew under Paragraph 64 of the Lease shall apply to the entire Premises, as expanded to include the 801 Space.
 
(f) If Lessee exercises the Expansion Option, Lessor shall use reasonable efforts to cause the 801 Commencement Date to occur as of July 1, 2007, July 1, 2008 or the day after any early termination of the Club One Lease, as applicable, as provided in paragraph 6(b) above. If, therefore, Club One has not vacated the 801 Space as of the expiration or earlier termination of the Club One Lease, Lessor shall further use reasonable efforts to cause Club One to vacate the 801 Space at the earliest date possible, including, without limitation, Lessor's prompt and diligent prosecution of unlawful detainer proceedings to evict Club One from the 801 Space. If, however, the 801 Commencement Date has not occurred for any reason by the ninetieth (90
th
) day after the expiration or earlier termination of the Club One Lease, then, at Lessee's election, (i) Lessee shall have the right to rescind Lessee's exercise of the Expansion Option, in which case the Lease shall remain in effect only as to the original Premises located at 881 Martin Avenue, or (ii) Lessee's exercise of the Expansion Option shall remain in effect, but the date that Lessee is otherwise obliged to commence payment of increased rent under paragraph 6(e)(i) above shall be delayed by one (1) day for every two (2) days that the 801 Commencement Date is delayed beyond such ninetieth (90
th
) day.
 
7. On or before September 30, 2005, Lessor shall, at Lessor's sole cost and expense, replace the roof of the building in which the 801 Space is located with a new roof substantially similar to the current roof of the building located at 881 Martin Avenue.
 
8. [Intentionally omitted]
 
9. Paragraph 8.6 is hereby amended by deleting the phrase "Without affecting any other rights or remedies" and substituting the phrase "Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary" in lieu thereof.
 
10. Lessor and Lessee each represent and warrant to the other that it has had no dealings with any person, firm, broker or finder in connection with the negotiation of this First Amendment and/or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, and that no broker or other person, firm or entity is entitled to any commission or finder's fee in connection with said transaction. Lessee and Lessor do each hereby agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless from and against liability for compensation or charges which may be claimed by any such broker, finder or other similar party by reason of any dealings or actions of the indemnifying Party, including any costs, expenses, and/or attorneys' fees reasonably incurred with respect thereto.
 
11. Except as expressly amended by this First Amendment, the Lease remains in full force and effect. All capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this First Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Lease.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have executed this First Amendment as of the day and year first above written.
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.2
 
 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE is made as of the 4
th
day of February, 2005, by and between JAMES S. LINDSEY, a resident of the State of California ("Lessor"), and ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Lessee"), with reference to the following facts and objectives:
 
A. Lessor and Lessee entered that certain Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease-Modified Net and Addendum thereto (collectively, the "Lease") both dated March 9, 2004 with respect to approximately 34,296 square feet of space (commonly known as 831 Martin Avenue) within the building (the "Building") located at 801-851 Martin Avenue in the City of Santa Clara, County of Santa Clara, State of California.
 
B. Lessor and Lessee mutually desire to extend the Original Term of the Lease and otherwise modify the terms and conditions of the Lease as provided in this First Amendment.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1. The Original Term is hereby extended for a period of five (5) additional years. The Expiration Date shall therefore be June 30, 2010.
 
2. Lessee shall pay to Lessor, for each calendar month from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010, monthly Base Rent as shown below, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, without prior notice or demand:
 
 
3. As of the 851 Commencement Date (as hereinafter defined), Lessor hereby leases to Lessee the approximately 15,704-square foot space in the Building commonly known as 851 Martin Avenue (the "851 Space") on the following terms and conditions:
 
(a) Lessor represents that (i) the 851 Space is currently leased to SABA, Inc. ("SABA") on a month-to-month basis, and (ii) SABA has no option to extend the term of its current lease (the "SABA Lease").
(b) The term of Lessee's lease of the 851 Space shall not commence until such date (the "851 Commencement Date", which date shall be deemed to be the "Commencement Date" under the Lease with respect to the 851 Space) that both of the following shall have occurred: (i) the SABA Lease shall in fact have terminated, and (ii) Lessor shall have tendered to Lessee possession of the 851 Space with all damage caused by SABA repaired. The 851 Space shall otherwise be in substantially the same condition as exists as of the date hereof, except as otherwise provided in this First Amendment.
 
(c) Lessee's lease of the 851 Space shall be on the same terms and conditions as the Lease, except as otherwise provided herein. Accordingly, as of the 851 Commencement Date, the Premises described in the Lease shall be expanded to include the 851 Space, and the following additional terms and conditions shall apply:
 
(i) Notwithstanding Section 2 above, from and after the 851 Commencement Date, monthly Base Rent under the Lease shall equal the following amounts:
 
 
(ii) Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses shall equal 49.8% with respect to expenses applicable only to the Building and 31.99% with respect to expenses applicable to the project of which the Building is a part.
 
(iii) Lessee shall have the use of two hundred (200) Unreserved Parking Spaces with respect to the Premises, as expanded to include the 851 Space.
 
(iv) The option to renew under Paragraph 71 of the Lease shall apply to the entire Premises, as expanded to include the 851 Space.
 
(d) Lessor shall use reasonable efforts to cause the 851 Commencement Date to occur on June 1, 2005. Lessor shall, therefore, take all necessary steps to cause the SABA Lease to terminate, and SABA to vacate the 851 Space, no later than May 31, 2005. If for any reason SABA has failed to vacate the 851 Space by May 31, 2005, Lessor shall further use reasonable efforts to cause SABA to vacate the 851 Space as soon thereafter as possible, including, without limitation, the prompt and diligent prosecution of unlawful detainer proceedings to evict SABA from the 851 Space.
 
4. On or before September 30, 2005, Lessor shall, at Lessor's sole cost and expense, replace the entire roof of the Building with a new roof substantially similar to the current roof of the building located at 881 Martin Avenue.
 
5. Notwithstanding Paragraph 7.4 or any other term or condition of the Lease, Lessee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove the chain-link product cage in the warehouse area of the Premises and/or the raised floor in the computer room of the Premises, and Lessee shall have no obligation to restore any of such removed improvements.
 
6. Paragraph 8.6 is hereby amended by deleting the phrase "Without affecting any other rights or remedies" and substituting the phrase "Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary" in lieu thereof.
 
7. Lessor agrees to grant Lessee, at Lessee's expense, the right to make such non-structural alterations to the Premises as are necessary for the conduct of Lessee's business. Prior to the commencement of any work, written consent from Lessor must be obtained, but Lessor agrees not to unreasonably withhold such consent.
 
8. Lessor acknowledges that Lessor and Lessee have entered that certain First Amendment to Lease (the "881 Amendment") dated the date hereof with respect to Lessee's lease of space within Lessor's building located at 881 Martin Avenue in the City and County of Santa Clara, State of California (the "881 Martin Lease"). Pursuant to the 881 Amendment, commencing July 1, 2005, and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through and including June 1, 2010, Lessor will deduct $10,575 from the 881 Martin Deposit and apply such amount against base rent due for such month under the 881 Martin Lease. Notwithstanding Paragraph 69 of the Lease, each such monthly deduction from the 881 Martin Deposit shall permanently reduce the amount thereof, and Lessee shall have no obligation to restore the 881 Martin Deposit to any prior amount.
 
9. A new Paragraph 71 is added to the Lease as follows:
 
71. OPTION TO RENEWARBITRATED RENT: Lessee is given the option to extend the term subject to all of the provisions contained in this Lease, except for base monthly rent, for a period of FIVE (5) years ("extended term") following the expiration of the Original Term (i.e., June 30, 2010), by giving notice of exercise of the option ("option notice") to Lessor at least four (4) months but no more than six (6) months before the expiration of the initial term. Provided that, if Lessee is in default beyond the applicable notice and cure periods on the date of giving the option notice, the option notice shall be totally ineffective, or if Lessee is in default on the date the extended term is to commence, Lessor may elect that the extended term shall not commence and this Lease shall expire at the end of the initial term. Provided further that, Lessee shall only have the right to exercise this extension option if Lessee also exercises any similar option to extend
 
the term of the 881 Martin Lease and any other lease between Lessor and Lessee regarding space in the Building then occupied by Lessee. The base rent shall be set at the commencement of the option period at fair market (highest and best use) rent. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days after Lessor receives the option notice in which to agree on base monthly rent during the extended term. If the parties agree on the base monthly rent for the extended term during that period, they shall immediately execute an amendment to this Lease stating the base monthly rent for the extended term. If the parties are unable to agree on the base monthly rent for the extended term within that period, then within ten (10) days after the expiration of that period, each party, at its cost and by giving notice to the other party, shall appoint a real estate appraiser with at least five (5) years' full-time commercial appraisal experience in the area in which the premises are located, to appraise and set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If a party does not appoint an appraiser within ten (10) days after the other party has given notice of the name of its appraiser, the single appraiser appointed shall be the sole appraiser and shall set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If the two appraisers are appointed by the parties as stated in this paragraph they shall meet promptly and attempt to set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If they are unable to agree within ten (10) days after the second appraiser has been appointed, they shall attempt to elect a third appraiser meeting the qualifications stated in this paragraph within ten (10) days after the last day the two appraisers are given to set the base monthly rent. If they are unable to agree on the third appraiser, either of the parties to this Lease, by giving ten (10) days' notice to the other party can apply to the then President of the county real estate board of Santa Clara County, or the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of that County, for the selection of a third appraiser who meets the qualifications stated in this paragraph. Each of the parties shall bear one-half (1/2) of the cost of appointing the third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee. The third appraiser, however selected, shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for either party. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third appraiser, a majority of the appraisers shall set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If a majority of the appraisers are unable to set the base monthly rent within the stipulated period of time, the three appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by three (3); the resulting quotient shall be the base monthly rent for the premises during the extended term. In no event shall the base rent at the commencement of the option period be less than the rent for the last month of the initial term. Following the exercise of the option, the rent shall be increased annually on each anniversary of the beginning of the extended term by three percent (3%).
 
10. Lessor and Lessee each represent and warrant to the other that it has had no dealings with any person, firm, broker or finder in connection with the negotiation of this First Amendment and/or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, and that no broker or other person, firm or entity is entitled to any commission or finder's fee in connection with said transaction. Lessee and Lessor do each hereby agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless
 
from and against liability for compensation or charges which may be claimed by any such broker, finder or other similar party by reason of any dealings or actions of the indemnifying Party, including any costs, expenses, and/or attorneys' fees reasonably incurred with respect thereto.
 
11. Except as expressly amended by this First Amendment, the Lease remains in full force and effect. All capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this First Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Lease.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have executed this First Amendment as of the day and year first above written.
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.3
 
 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE is made as of the 4
th
day of February, 2005, by and between JAMES S. LINDSEY, a resident of the State of California ("Lessor"), and ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Lessee"), with reference to the following facts and objectives:
 
A. Lessor and Lessee entered that certain Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease-Modified Net and Addendum thereto (collectively, the "Lease") both dated August 30, 2001 with respect to approximately 20,627 square feet of space (commonly known as 821 Martin Avenue) within the building (the "Building") located at 801-851 Martin Avenue in the City of Santa Clara, County of Santa Clara, State of California.
 
B. Lessor and Lessee mutually desire to extend the Original Term of the Lease and otherwise modify the terms and conditions of the Lease as provided in this First Amendment.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1. Lessor and Lessee acknowledge that Lessee has previously exercised its option to renew the Term of the Lease pursuant to Paragraph 64 thereof so that the Expiration Date is currently June 30, 2005. The Original Term is hereby extended for an additional period of five (5) years. The Expiration Date is therefore amended to be June 30, 2010.
 
2. Paragraph 49 of the Lease is hereby amended by adding the following dates and amounts thereto:
 
 
3. Paragraph 70 of the Lease is hereby amended by adding the following sentence to the end thereof: "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, for purposes of Article 12 of this Lease and Articles 59 through 62 of this Addendum, the term "assignment" shall not be deemed to include the trading of Lessee's stock on a nationally recognized exchange or pursuant to an initial public offering."
4. Lessor acknowledges that Lessor and Lessee have entered that certain First Amendment to Lease (the "881 Amendment") dated the date hereof with respect to Lessee's lease of space within Lessor's building located at 881 Martin Avenue in the City and County of Santa Clara, State of California (the "881 Martin Lease"). Pursuant to the 881 Amendment, commencing July 1, 2005, and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through and including June 1, 2010, Lessor will deduct $10,575 from the 881 Martin Deposit and apply such amount against base rent due for such month under the 881 Martin Lease. Notwithstanding Paragraph 74 of the Lease, each such monthly deduction from the 881 Martin Deposit shall permanently reduce the amount thereof, and Lessee shall have no obligation to restore the 881 Martin Deposit to any prior amount.
 
5. A new Paragraph 76 is added to the Lease as follows:
 
76. ADDITIONAL OPTION TO RENEWARBITRATED RENT: Lessee is given the further option to extend the term subject to all of the provisions contained in this Lease, except for base monthly rent, for a period of FIVE (5) years ("extended term") following the expiration of the Original Term (i.e., June 30, 2010), by giving notice of exercise of the option ("option notice") to Lessor at least four (4) months but no more than six (6) months before the expiration of the initial term. Provided that, if Lessee is in default beyond the applicable notice and cure periods on the date of giving the option notice, the option notice shall be totally ineffective, or if Lessee is in default on the date the extended term is to commence, Lessor may elect that the extended term shall not commence and this Lease shall expire at the end of the initial term. Provided further that, Lessee shall only have the right to exercise this extension option if Lessee also exercises any similar option to extend the term of the 881 Martin Lease and any other lease between Lessor and Lessee regarding space in the Building then occupied by Lessee. The base rent shall be set at the commencement of the option period at fair market (highest and best use) rent. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days after Lessor receives the option notice in which to agree on base monthly rent during the extended term. If the parties agree on the base monthly rent for the extended term during that period, they shall immediately execute an amendment to this Lease stating the base monthly rent for the extended term. If the parties are unable to agree on the base monthly rent for the extended term within that period, then within ten (10) days after the expiration of that period, each party, at its cost and by giving notice to the other party, shall appoint a real estate appraiser with at least five (5) years' full-time commercial appraisal experience in the area in which the premises are located, to appraise and set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If a party does not appoint an appraiser within ten (10) days after the other party has given notice of the name of its appraiser, the single appraiser appointed shall be the sole appraiser and shall set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If the two appraisers are appointed by the parties as stated in this paragraph they shall meet promptly and
 
attempt to set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If they are unable to agree within ten (10) days after the second appraiser has been appointed, they shall attempt to elect a third appraiser meeting the qualifications stated in this paragraph within ten (10) days after the last day the two appraisers are given to set the base monthly rent. If they are unable to agree on the third appraiser, either of the parties to this Lease, by giving ten (10) days' notice to the other party can apply to the then President of the county real estate board of Santa Clara County, or the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of that County, for the selection of a third appraiser who meets the qualifications stated in this paragraph. Each of the parties shall bear one-half (1/2) of the cost of appointing the third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee. The third appraiser, however selected, shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for either party. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third appraiser, a majority of the appraisers shall set the base monthly rent for the extended term. If a majority of the appraisers are unable to set the base monthly rent within the stipulated period of time, the three appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by three (3); the resulting quotient shall be the base monthly rent for the premises during the extended term. In no event shall the base rent at the commencement of the option period be less than the rent for the last month of the initial term. Following the exercise of the option, the rent shall be increased annually on each anniversary of the beginning of the extended term by three percent (3%).
 
6. [Intentionally omitted]
 
7. Paragraph 8.6 is hereby amended by deleting the phrase "Without affecting any other rights or remedies" and substituting the phrase "Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary" in lieu thereof.
 
8. Lessor and Lessee each represent and warrant to the other that it has had no dealings with any person, firm, broker or finder in connection with the negotiation of this First Amendment and/or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, and that no broker or other person, firm or entity is entitled to any commission or finder's fee in connection with said transaction. Lessee and Lessor do each hereby agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless from and against liability for compensation or charges which may be claimed by any such broker, finder or other similar party by reason of any dealings or actions of the indemnifying Party, including any costs, expenses, and/or attorneys' fees reasonably incurred with respect thereto.
 
9. Except as expressly amended by this First Amendment, the Lease remains in full force and effect. All capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this First Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Lease.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have executed this First Amendment as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 99.1 ALIGN TECHNOLOGY VP RESIGNS TO LEAD CARDIOVASCULAR COMPANY SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today announced that Robert D. Mitchell has resigned as Vice President, Worldwide Sales to join MILLiMED Holdings, Inc. as President and CEO, effective March 23, 2005. Mr. Mitchell joined Align in July 2004. During his tenure, Align saw a 17 percent increase in the number of doctors using Invisalign worldwide. Regarding his departure, Mr. Mitchell said, "This is a bittersweet transition. I'm excited about returning to the cardiovascular industry and taking on the challenges of an early stage company, but I have had a tremendously positive experience at Align. I believe in Align's people, its customers, its technology and its potential to impact millions of patients. This is a great company, and I look forward to seeing continued growth and success at Align in the years ahead." Mr. Mitchell served on the board of privately-owned MILLiMED prior to accepting the position of CEO for the company. Based in Helsingborg, Sweden, MILLiMED develops, manufactures and markets therapeutic devices for neurovascular and cardiovascular applications. "Bob has been a valuable asset to the Align team," said Align President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M. Prescott. "We are sorry to see him go, but wish him all the best as he takes this important step forward in his career." David Thrower, Align Vice President, Global Marketing, will assume day-to-day responsibility and management of all sales operations until a replacement for Mr. Mitchell has been named. About Align Technology, Inc. Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2005. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2005 were $51.2 million, compared to $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 30.5 percent.

"2005 promises to be an important year for Align representing significant changes. We believe these changes will make us a better company and make Invisalign the best product for our customers. We are on track to providing customers with additional product options that will help expand their practices.

About Align Technology, Inc. Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in April 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

We believe that our non-GAAP net profit gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net profit is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net profit prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan.  Shares used to pay the exercise price of an Option will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  Shares used to satisfy tax withholding obligations will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment provided in Section 16, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(c).

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrator may not modify or amend an Option or SAR to reduce the exercise price of such Option or SAR after it has been granted (except for adjustments made pursuant to Section 16) nor may the Administrator cancel any outstanding Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR with a lower exercise price, unless, in either case, such action is approved by the Company's stockholders;
                                        (vii)       to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
                                        (viii)      to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may determine;
                                        (ix)        to grant in addition to the incentives described in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 below, other incentives payable in cash or Shares under the Plan as determined by the Administrator to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to any terms and conditions the Administrator deems advisable; and
                                        (x)         to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
                       (c)          .  The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.

Nonstatutory Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance Shares and such other cash or stock awards as the Administrator determines may be granted to Service Providers.

Limitations

However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
                                        (ii)         The following limitations will apply to grants of Options:

                        For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
                        Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
          17.          
Tax Withholding
                        (a)          .  Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). 
Withholding Requirements
                        (b)          .  The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld.  The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
Withholding Arrangements
          18.          .  Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
No Effect on Employment or Service
          19.          .  The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
          20.          .  Subject to Section 24 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board.  It will continue in effect for a term ending on December 31, 2010 unless terminated earlier under Section 21of the Plan.
Term of Plan
          21.          .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
                        (a)          .  The Administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan. 
Amendment and Termination
                        (b)          .  The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.  Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the number of Shares available under the Plan pursuant to Section 3 herein may not be increased without approval of the Company's stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.
Stockholder Approval
                        (c)          .  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.  Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
          22.          .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
                        (a)          .  Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
                        (b)          .  As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
          23.          .  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
          24.          .  The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted.  Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.

Stock Subject to the Plan

With respect to SARs, Shares actually issued pursuant to a SAR as well as the Shares that represent payment of the exercise price will cease to be available under the Plan.  Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan.  Shares used to pay the exercise price of an Option will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  Shares used to satisfy tax withholding obligations will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment provided in Section 16, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(c).
Lapsed Awards
                       (d)          .  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Share Reserve
          4.          .

                                        (vii)       to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
                                        (viii)      to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may determine;
                                        (ix)        to grant in addition to the incentives described in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 below, other incentives payable in cash or Shares under the Plan as determined by the Administrator to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to any terms and conditions the Administrator deems advisable; and

                       (c)          .  The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.
Effect of Administrator's Decision
          5.          .  Nonstatutory Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance Shares and such other cash or stock awards as the Administrator determines may be granted to Service Providers.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company.
Eligibility
          6.          .
Stock Options
                       (a)          .
Limitations
                                        (i)           Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
                                        (ii)         The following limitations will apply to grants of Options:
                                                       (1)           No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
                                                       (2)          In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options or SARs to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares, which will not count against the limit set forth in Section 6(a)(2)(ii)(1) above.
                                                       (3)          The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 16.
                                                       (4)          If an Option or SAR is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 16), the cancelled Option or SAR, as applicable, will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above.  For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and the grant of a new Option or SAR, as applicable.
                       (b)          .  The Administrator will determine the term of each Option in its sole discretion.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.  Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

                                                                      b)           granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
                                                       (2)           In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. 
                                                       (3)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.
                                        (ii)         .  At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.

Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement.  An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
                                        An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with an applicable withholding taxes).  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.
                                        (ii)         .  If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death, Disability or Misconduct, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement).  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan.  If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan.  If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
                                        (iv)         .  If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator.  If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan.  If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

Each Award of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any Fiscal Year no Participant will receive more than an aggregate of 500,000 Shares of Restricted Stock; provided, however, that in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted an aggregate of up to an additional 500,000 Shares of Restricted Stock.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock will be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such Shares have lapsed.

Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine; provided, however, that Awards of Performance Units/Shares will vest no earlier than one-third (1/3) of the total number units or Shares subject to such Award each year from the date of grant, unless the Administrator determines that the Award is to vest upon the achievement of a performance objective, provided the period for measuring performance will be at least twelve months.

After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share upon or in connection with a Change in Control or upon or in connection with a Participant's termination of service, including, without limitation, due to death or Disability.

Other Cash or Stock Awards
          11.          .

Any Performance Goals may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or a business unit of the Company and may be measured relative to a peer group or index.  The Performance Goals for a Participant will be determined by the Administrator based on the Company's tactical and strategic business objectives, which may differ from Participant to Participant and from Award to Award.  Prior to the Determination Date, the Administrator will determine whether to make any adjustments to the calculation of any Performance Goal with respect to any Participant for any significant or extraordinary events affecting the Company.  In all other respects, Performance Goals will be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology established by the Administrator prior to the issuance of an Award, which is consistently applied and identified in the financial statements, including footnotes, or the management discussion and analysis section of the Company's annual report.
Performance Goals

A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary.  For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three (3) months following the 91st day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
Leaves of Absence
          13.          .  Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant.  If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards
          14.          .  If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider due to his or her Misconduct or should a Participant engage in Misconduct while holding an outstanding Award, then all Awards that the Participant then holds will immediately terminate and the Participant will have no further rights with respect to such Awards.  Upon such a termination, the Shares covered by the Awards that so terminate will revert to the Plan.

                                        (iii)        Twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares subject to each First Option will vest on each anniversary of the date of grant of such Option, so that 100% of the Shares subject to such Option will be vested four (4) years from the grant date, subject to Optionee continuing to be a Director through such dates.  One hundred percent (100%) of the Shares subject to each Subsequent Option will vest on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the Optionee continuing to be a Director through such date.
                        (d)          .  The Administrator in its discretion may change and otherwise revise the terms of Options granted under this Section 15, including, without limitation, the number of Shares and exercise prices thereof, for Options granted on or after the date the Administrator determines to make any such change or revision.
Adjustments
          16.          .
Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control
                        (a)          .  In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, may (in its sole discretion) adjust the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 15.
Adjustments
                        (b)          .  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.  To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
                        (c)          .  In the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met.  In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
Change in Control
                        With respect to Awards granted to Outside Directors that are assumed or substituted for, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares subject thereto, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met.
                        For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
                        Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
          17.          
Tax Withholding
                        (a)          .  Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). 
Withholding Requirements
                        (b)          .  The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld.  The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
Withholding Arrangements
          18.          .  Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
No Effect on Employment or Service
          19.          .  The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
          20.          .  Subject to Section 24 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board.  It will continue in effect for a term ending on December 31, 2010 unless terminated earlier under Section 21 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
          21.          .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
                        (a)          .  The Administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan. 
Amendment and Termination
                        (b)          .  The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.  Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the number of Shares available under the Plan pursuant to Section 3 herein may not be increased without approval of the Company's stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.
Stockholder Approval
                        (c)          .  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.  Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
          22.          .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
                        (a)          .  Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
                        (b)          .  As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
          23.          .  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
          24.          .  The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted.  Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval

About Align Technology, Inc.
 
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

ITEM 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          On July 22, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") approved the standard compensation arrangement for the lead independent director as follows:
The cash compensation for Align's other directors described in Align's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2005 remains unchanged.
ITEM 2.05     Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
          On July 27, 2005, as part of ongoing efforts to optimize operations, improve efficiency and reduce operating costs, Align announced the consolidation of key aspects of its manufacturing process in Juarez, Mexico (the "Consolidation"), which will take place in several phases during the remaining quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.  A copy of the press release announcing the Consolidation is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.  
          The Consolidation consists of a phased relocation of Align's stereolithography (SLA) mold fabrication operations from Santa Clara to an existing facility managed by TECMA Group LLC ("TECMA") in Juarez. Since 2003, Align has outsourced key portions of its manufacturing process to TECMA.  On July 26, 2005, as part of the Consolidation, Align notified approximately 21 employees in Santa Clara, California that their positions would be eliminated under a plan of termination. Align expects the Consolidation to result in annualized savings of approximately $1.3 million beginning in mid- 2006.  
          Align expects to incur approximately $0.8 million in expenses related to retention, severance and other costs associated with the termination of employees and approximately $2.6 million in capital expenditures associated with the purchase of SLA manufacturing and related equipment, for an aggregate cost of $3.4 million.   Align expects to incur most of these costs in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. The costs are attributable to the following items, which Align expects to incur in the applicable quarter set forth below.
Forward-Looking Statements
          This report contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's belief regarding the timing of the relocation of the SLA mold fabrication operations, Align's statements regarding expected amount and timing of cost savings and the amount and timing of costs to be incurred in connection with the relocation.  Forward-looking statements contained in this report relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof.  Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.  As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement.  Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, lower than anticipated reductions in headcount or expenses in connection with the relocation, a delay in the implementation of the relocation and greater than anticipated costs resulting from the relocation; risks relating to reliance on TECMA for key inputs to Align's manufacturing process, as well as Align's reliance on manufacturers of SLA machines.  These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2005, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 5, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, announced today that the Company will consolidate key aspects of its manufacturing process in Juarez, Mexico as part of ongoing efforts to optimize operations, improve efficiency and reduce operating costs.
Beginning now and concluding in late Q1 of 2006, Align will execute a phased relocation of stereolithography (SLA) mold fabrication operations from Santa Clara to an existing facility managed by TECMA Group LLC in Juarez. This transition is in line with Align's long-term plan to consolidate and automate SLA and aligner fabrication, and will result in a two-day reduction in cycle time as well as lower operating costs. Align expects annualized savings of approximately $1.3 million beginning in mid-2006.
"Integration and automation of physical manufacturing has been a core part of Align's corporate strategy, and will ultimately allow us to improve product quality, gross margins, and customer satisfaction," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align President and Chief Executive Officer. "Consolidating SLA and aligner fabrication is an important step forward in that initiative."
Since 2003, Align has outsourced key portions of its manufacturing processes to TECMA, an El Paso, Texas-based turnkey manufacturing company which operates FDA and ISO certified facilities in Mexico.
As part of the consolidation, Align will expense approximately $0.8 million in retention and severance, equipment move and other start-up costs as incurred through Q1 2006. Align will also purchase $2.6 million in capital equipment in order to facilitate the phased relocation, resulting in no anticipated downtime or delays for customers. Align will eliminate twenty-one positions at the Santa Clara facility over the course of the transition.
Align reaffirms financial guidance previously given on the July 20, 2005 financial results conference call which can be heard on investor.aligntech.com.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Santa Clara, Calif.  September 14, 2005  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today announced the promotion of company veteran Gil Laks. As Vice President, International, Mr. Laks has managed strategic direction and operations for Align Europe since 2001.  In his new role, Mr. Laks will retain his current title, but will now have responsibility for Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and has been appointed to the Company's executive management committee.
 
"Gil has been an invaluable part of the Align team, and is largely responsible for Invisalign treatment's adoption and success in Europe," said Mr. Thomas M. Prescott, Align President and Chief Executive Officer. "I have tremendous confidence that he will bring the same commitment, customer-focus and results to the Company's initiatives in other regions of the world."
 
About Align Technology, Inc.
 
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

This news release contains forward-looking statements, including statements by Mr. Prescott that Mr. Laks will bring the same results to Align's initiatives in other regions of the world. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks related to our international sales, including. among other things, the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, and whether orthodontists, dentists and consumers outside Align's domestic market will adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or at all. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2005, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 6, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company"), approved accelerating the vesting of all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than $7.10.   Options held by non-employee directors are excluded from the vesting acceleration.
 
As a result of the acceleration, approximately 3.8 million options or 35% of the total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of October 6, 2005.  Of the aggregate number of options subject to the acceleration, approximately 1.2 million options or 32% of the total accelerated options are held by executive officers of the Company, as follows:
 
 
The Compensation Committee also required that, as a condition to the acceleration of options held by executive officers, each officer agree to refrain from selling common stock acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the options' pre-acceleration vesting terms or, if earlier, the executive officer's last day of employment or upon a "change in control" as defined in the 2001 Incentive Plan, the 2005 Incentive Plan or any employment agreement between the individual and the Company.  The form of such agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
 
The primary purpose of the acceleration is to eliminate future compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), ("SFAS 123R").  SFAS 123R is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2006, and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in the Company's consolidated financial statements.   The Company estimates that the aggregate future expense that will be eliminated over the next four years as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options is approximately $15.2 million, as follows:

WHEREAS, Executive has been granted one or more options that constitute Accelerated Options ("Executive Accelerated Options");
 
WHEREAS, the Company and Executive wish to impose certain resale restrictions on the shares (the "Shares") underlying the Executive Accelerated Options on the terms and conditions contained herein.

Executive represents and warrants that he or she has full power to enter into this Agreement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Santa Clara, Calif.  October 11, 2005  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today announced that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than $7.10 held by current employees and officers of the Company. The $7.10 price was 11 percent higher than the price at which Align Technology common stock traded on October 6, 2005, the date the Compensation Committee approved the acceleration plan. The accelerated options represent approximately 35 percent, or 3.8 million, of the total of all outstanding Align Technology options.
 
As a condition of the acceleration and to prevent executive officers from unintended personal benefit, the Company's executive officers have agreed to refrain from selling common stock acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options until the original vesting date or, if earlier, the officer's last day of employment or upon a change in control. Options held by non-employee directors of the Company are excluded from the accelerated vesting.
 
The primary purpose of the acceleration is to eliminate future compensation expenses associated with the accelerated options that the Company would otherwise recognize upon its planned adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, (SFAS 123R), which becomes effective on January 1, 2006. As a result of the vesting acceleration, the Company estimates that approximately $15.2million in aggregate future expenses will be eliminated over the next four years.

Exhibit 99.1 ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. REPORTS Q3 2005 REVENUES OF $50.9M AND NET LOSS OF $1.5M SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2005. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2005 were $50.9 million, compared to $45.8 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 11.1 percent. "We continue to make solid progress in product development and manufacturing systems initiatives," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "Our commitment to creating long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees is reflected in our drive to make Invisalign the treatment of choice for straightening teeth." The net loss for the third quarter of 2005, as reported on a GAAP basis, was $1.5 million, or loss per share of $0.02. This compares to a GAAP net profit of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2004, or diluted EPS of $0.05 per share. For comparison purposes, this also compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $4.7 million for the third quarter of 2004 or non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.07. Non-GAAP net profit excludes the effects of stock-based compensation. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net profit (loss) and EPS is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 25, 2005, pursuant to a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the "t") between Align Technology, Inc. (the "") and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. as Rights Agent (the ""), the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (a "") to purchase one one-thousandth share of the Company's Series A Participating Preferred Stock ("") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""), of the Company.  The dividend is payable on November 22, 2005 (the "") to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date.  Each Right entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred at an exercise price of $37.00 (the ""), subject to adjustment.

The following summary of the principal terms of the Rights Agreement is a general description only and is subject to the detailed terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement.  A copy of the Rights Agreement is attached hereto as and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 4.1
 
Rights Evidenced by Common Share Certificates
 
The Rights will not be exercisable until the Distribution Date (defined below).  Certificates for the Rights ("") will not be sent to shareholders and the Rights will attach to and trade only together with the Common Shares.  Accordingly, Common Share certificates outstanding on the Record Date will evidence the Rights related thereto, and Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender or transfer of any certificates for Common Shares, outstanding as of the Record Date, even without notation or a copy of the Summary of Rights being attached thereto, also will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate.
Rights Certificates
 
Distribution Date
 
The Rights will be separate from the Common Shares, Rights Certificates will be issued and the Rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of (a) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons ("") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding, or (b) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares.  The earlier of such dates is referred to as the "." An Acquiring Person does not include certain persons specified in the Rights Agreement.
Acquiring Person
Distribution Date
 
Issuance of Rights Certificates; Expiration of Rights
 
As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, a Rights Certificate will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Rights Certificate alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date.  The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) November 22, 2015, (the ""), or (ii) redemption or exchange of the Rights as described below.
Final Expiration Date
Initial Exercise of the Rights
 
Following the Distribution Date, and until one of the further events described below, holders of the Rights will be entitled to receive, upon exercise and the payment of the Purchase Price, one one-thousandth share of the Series A Preferred.  In the event that the Company does not have sufficient Common Stock available for all Rights to be exercised, or the Board decides that such action is necessary or appropriate and not contrary to the interests of Rights holders, the Company may instead substitute cash, assets or other securities for the Common Stock for which the Rights would have been exercisable under this provision or as described below.
 
Right to Buy Company Common Shares
 
Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares, then each holder of a Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Shares having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price.  Rights are not exercisable following the occurrence of an event as described above until such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable by the Company as set forth below.
 
Right to Buy Acquiring Company Shares
 
Similarly, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that, after an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares, (i) the Company merges into another entity, (ii) an acquiring entity merges into the Company or (iii) 50% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or earning power are sold (other than in transactions in the ordinary course of business), proper provision must be made so that each holder of a Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price.
 
Exchange Provision
 
At any time after an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares and prior to the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by the Acquiring Person), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right.
 
Redemption
 
At any time on or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following the attainment of 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares by an Acquiring Person (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors and publicly announced by the Company), or (ii) the Final Expiration Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right.
 
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution
 
The Purchase Price payable, the number of Rights, and the number of Series A Preferred or Common Shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time in connection with the dilutive issuances by the Company as set forth in the Rights Agreement.  With
certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price.
 
Cash Paid Instead of Issuing Fractional Shares
 
No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of a Right and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.
 
No Shareholders' Rights Prior to Exercise
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company (other than any rights resulting from such holder's ownership of Common Shares), including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
Amendment of Rights Agreement
 
The terms of the Rights and the Rights Agreement may be amended in any respect without the consent of the Rights holders on or prior to the Distribution Date; thereafter, the terms of the Rights and the Rights Agreement may be amended without the consent of the Rights holders in order to cure any ambiguities or to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of Rights holders (other than the Acquiring Person).
 
Rights and Preferences of the Series A Preferred
 
Each one one-thousandth (0.001) of a share of Series A Preferred has rights and preferences substantially equivalent to those of one (1) Common Share.
 
No Voting Rights
 
Rights will not have any voting rights.
 
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects
 
The Rights approved by the Board of Directors are designed to protect and maximize the value of the outstanding equity interests in the Company in the event of an unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over the Company in a manner or on terms not approved by the Board of Directors.  Takeover attempts frequently include coercive tactics to deprive the Company's Board of Directors and its shareholders of any real opportunity to determine the destiny of the Company.  The Rights have been declared by the Board in order to deter such tactics, including a gradual accumulation of shares in the open market of 15% or greater position to be followed by a merger or a partial or two-tier tender offer that does not treat all shareholders equally.  These tactics unfairly pressure shareholders, squeeze them out of their investment without giving them any real choice and deprive them of the full value of their shares.
 
The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and will not do so.  Subject to the restrictions described above and as more fully set forth in the Rights Agreement, the Rights may be redeemed by the Company at $0.001 per Right at any time prior to the Distribution Date.  Accordingly, the Rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors.
 
However, the Rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by the Board of Directors.  The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms or in a manner not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon the negation, purchase or redemption of the Rights.
 
Issuance of the Rights does not in any way weaken the financial strength of the Company or interfere with its business plans.  The issuance of the Rights themselves has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, should not be taxable to the Company or to its shareholders, and will not change the way in which the Company's shares are presently traded.  The Company's Board of Directors believes that the Rights represent a sound and reasonable means of addressing the complex issues of corporate policy created by the current takeover environment.

With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such

Thereupon the Rights Agent shall, subject to Sections 7(e), 14 and 24 hereof, countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested.

Subject to Sections 7(e), 23(b) and 24(b) hereof, the registered holder of any Rights Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Close of Business on the Expiration Date by surrender of the Rights Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with payment of the Exercise Price for each one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or, following a Triggering Event, other securities, cash or other assets as the case may be) as to which the Rights are exercised.
(a)
                                 
 
The Exercise Price for each one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share issuable pursuant to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $37.00, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof and shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) below.

In the event that the Company is obligated to issue securities of the Company other than Preferred Shares, pay cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities, cash and/or other property are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.
 
In case the registered holder of any Rights Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Rights Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Rights Certificate or to his or her duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.

The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b) hereof are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Rights Certificates or to any other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or any of such Acquiring Person's Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in Section 7 unless such registered holder shall, in addition to having complied with the requirements of subsection 7(a), have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Rights Certificate surrendered for such exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any Rights Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof.  The Rights Agent shall deliver all canceled Rights Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy  such canceled Rights Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate evidencing the destruction thereof to the Company.

Reservation and Availability of Preferred Shares
 
The Company covenants and agrees that it will use its best efforts to cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Preferred Shares not reserved for another purpose (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares and/or other securities), the number of Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of the Triggering Event, Common Shares and/or other securities) that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.
(a)
                                 
 
If the Company shall hereafter list any of its Preferred Shares on a national securities exchange, then so long as the Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Common Shares and/or other securities) issuable and deliverable upon exercise of the Rights may be listed on such exchange, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and

The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after the first occurrence of a Triggering Event in which the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights is described in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, or as soon as is required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the date of expiration of the Rights.  The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days after the date set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective.  Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating, and notify the Rights Agent, that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement and notification to the Rights Agent at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect.  The Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction, unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained, or an exemption therefrom shall be available, and until a registration statement has been declared and remains effective.
(c)
                                 
 
The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such securities (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
(d)
                                
 
The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) upon the exercise of Rights.  The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depository receipts for the Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Rights Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver any certificates or depository receipts for Preferred Shares (or other securities of the

Company) upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Rights Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no such tax is due.
 
.  Each Person in whose name any certificate for a number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or other securities of the Company) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Total Exercise Price with respect to which the Rights have been exercised (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the transfer books of the Company are open.  Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Rights Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment.

The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the
(h)
                                
number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made.  This record date may be the date on which the Exercise Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if any Rights Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public announcement.  If Rights Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(h), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Rights Certificates on such record date Rights Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Rights Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Rights Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment.  Rights Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Exercise Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Rights Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
 
Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price or the number of Preferred Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Rights Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Exercise Price per one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share and the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share which were expressed in the initial Rights Certificates issued hereunder.
(i)
                                    
 
Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Exercise Price below the par or stated value, if any, of the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable shares such number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share at such adjusted Exercise Price.
(j)
                                    
 
In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares (fractional or otherwise) upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Exercise Price, in
(l)
                                    
addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred or Common Shares, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of any Preferred or Common Shares at less than the current market price, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred or Common Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred or Common Shares, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred or Common Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
 
The Company covenants and agrees that, after the Distribution Date, it will not, except as permitted by Sections 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or permit to be taken) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.

In the event that the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common Shares (by reverse stock split or otherwise) into a smaller number of Common Shares, or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), then, in each such event, except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and Section 7(e) hereof: (1) each Common Share (or shares of capital stock issued in such reclassification of the Common Shares) outstanding immediately following such time shall have associated with it the number of Rights as were associated with one Common Share immediately prior to the occurrence of the event described in clauses (A)-(D) above; (2) the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted so that the Exercise Price thereafter shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such time by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the event described in clauses (A)-(D) above, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of such Right; and (3) the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) issuable upon the exercise of each Right outstanding after such event shall equal the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) as were issuable with respect to one Right immediately prior to such event.  Each Common Share that shall become outstanding after an adjustment has been made pursuant to this Section 11(n) shall have associated with it the number of Rights, exercisable at the Exercise Price and for the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) as one Common Share has associated with it immediately following the adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(n).  If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both this Section 11(n)

.  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Rights Certificate in accordance with Section 26 hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to make such certification or give such notice shall not affect the validity of such adjustment or the force or effect of the requirement for such adjustment.  The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment contained therein and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

(ii)
                                 
 
the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating fifty percent (50%) or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries in one or more transactions, each of which individually (and together) complies with Section 11(m) hereof),

then, concurrent with and in each such case,
 
each holder of a Right (except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the Total Exercise Price applicable immediately prior to the occurrence of the Section 13 Event in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of validly authorized and issued, fully paid, nonassessable and freely tradeable Common Shares of the Principal Party (as hereinafter defined), free of any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing such Total Exercise Price by an amount equal to fifty percent

(50%) of the Current Per Share Market Price of the Common Shares of such Principal Party on the date of consummation of such Section 13 Event, that the Exercise Price and the number of Common Shares of such Principal Party so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(e) hereof;
provided, however,
 
such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Section 13 Event, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement;
(B)
                               
 
the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party, it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section 11 hereof shall apply only to such Principal Party following the first occurrence of a Section 13 Event;
(C)
                               
 
such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares) in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to ensure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; and

upon the subsequent occurrence of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled to receive, upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Total Exercise Price as provided in this Section 13(a), such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder, at the time of such transaction, owned the Common Shares of the Principal Party receivable upon the exercise of such Right pursuant to this Section 13(a), and such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property.

Shares of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger does not survive the merger, the Person that does survive the merger (including the Company if it survives) or (z) the Person resulting from the consolidation; and
 
in the case of any transaction described in clause (iii) of Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions, or, if more than one Person that is a party to such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or earning power so transferred and each such portion would, were it not for the other equal portions, constitute the greatest portion of the assets or earning power so transferred, or if the Person receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding; that in any such case described in the foregoing clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common Shares of such Person are not at such time or have not been continuously over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then (1) if such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person, or (2) if such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly by the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the owners having an interest in the venture as if the Person owned by the joint venture was a Subsidiary of both or all of such joint venturers, and the Principal Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as its interest in such Person bears to the total of such interests.

The Company shall not consummate any Section 13 Event unless the Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of authorized Common Shares that have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement confirming that such Principal Party shall, upon consummation of such Section 13 Event, assume this Agreement in accordance with Sections 13(a) and 13(b) hereof, that all rights of first refusal or preemptive rights in respect of the issuance of Common Shares of such Principal Party upon exercise of outstanding Rights have been waived, that there are no rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which, as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights and that such transaction shall not result in a default by such Principal Party under this Agreement, and further providing that, as soon as practicable after the date of such Section 13 Event, such Principal Party will:
(c)
                                 
 
prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as
(i)
                                    
practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws;
 
use its best efforts to list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on a national securities exchange or to meet the eligibility requirements for quotation on Nasdaq and list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on Nasdaq; and
(ii)
                                 
 
deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for such Principal Party which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act.
(iii)
                              
 
In the event that at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event some or all of the Rights shall not have been exercised at the time of a transaction described in this Section 13, the Rights which have not theretofore been exercised shall thereafter be exercisable in the manner described in Section 13(a) (without taking into account any prior adjustment required by Section 11(a)(ii)).
 
In case the "Principal Party" for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof has provision in any of its authorized securities or in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other instrument governing its corporate affairs, which provision would have the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue (other than to holders of Rights pursuant to Section 13 hereof), in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of a Section 13 Event, Common Shares or Equivalent Shares of such Principal Party at less than the then Current Per Share Market Price thereof or securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Shares or Equivalent Shares of such Principal Party at less than such then Current Per Share Market Price, or (ii) providing for any special payment, tax or similar provision in connection with the issuance of the Common Shares of such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then, in such event, the Company hereby agrees with each holder of Rights that it shall not consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such Principal Party shall have been canceled, waived or amended, or that the authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will have no effect in connection with or as a consequence of, the consummation of the proposed transaction.

The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Distribution Date, effect or permit to occur any Section 13 Event, if (i) at the time or immediately after such Section 13 Event there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (ii) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such Section 13 Event, the stockholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal Party" for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights

Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
 
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Rights Certificates which evidence fractional Rights.  In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right.  For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable, as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof.
(a)
                                 
 
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share).  Interests in fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depository receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depository selected by it; , that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depository receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depository receipts.  In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a Preferred Share.  For purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be (x) one thousand multiplied by (y) the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.

The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares upon the exercise or exchange of Rights.  In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a Common Share.  For purposes of this Section 14(c), the current market value of a Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common

Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
 
The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his or her right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of a Right.

Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.

(a)
                                 
 
Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter (including, without limitation, the identity of any Acquiring Person and the determination of Current Per Share Market Price) be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(b)
                                
 
The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
(c)

(d)
                                
The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates after receipt by the Rights Agent of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(e)

Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective.  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date on which any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
(g)
                                
 
The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were
(h)
                                
not Rights Agent under this Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.

(i)
                                    
 
No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(j)
                                    
 
If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has either not been completed or indicates an affirmative response to clause 1 and/or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.
(k)
                                 
 
.

If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Rights Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his or her Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Rights Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the

Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
 
.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Rights Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Such redemption of the Rights by the Company may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.  The date on which the Board of Directors elects to make the redemption effective shall be referred to as the

The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption.  Within ten (10) days after the action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.  Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.

Exchange
 
Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, and subject to subsection 24(c) below, the Company may, at its option, by action of the Board of Directors, at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
(a)
                                 
 "Exchange Ratio"
 
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection 24(a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.  The Company shall give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  The Company shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given,
(b)
                                
provided

whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.  Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
 
In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with Section 24(a), the Company shall either take such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights or alternatively, at the option of a majority of the Board of Directors, with respect to each Right (i) pay cash in an amount equal to the Current Value (as hereinafter defined), in lieu of issuing Common Shares in exchange therefor, or (ii) issue debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, having a value equal to the Current Value, in lieu of issuing Common Shares in exchange for each such Right, where the value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by majority vote of the Board of Directors, or (iii) deliver any combination of cash, property, Common Shares and/or other securities having a value equal to the Current Value in exchange for each Right.  For purposes of this Section 24(c) only, the Current Value shall mean the product of the Current Per Share Market Price of Common Shares on the date of the occurrence of the event described above in subsection (a), multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Right otherwise would be exchangeable if there were sufficient shares available.  To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 24(c), the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to sixty (60) days following the date on which the event described in Section 24(a) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof.  In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended.
(c)
                                 
 
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares.  In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof).
(d)
                                
 
The Company may, at its option, by majority vote of the Board of Directors, at any time before any Person has become an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights for rights of substantially equivalent value, as determined reasonably and with good faith by the Board of Directors based upon the advice of one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms.
(e)
                                 
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection 24(e) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of rights in exchange therefor as has been determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with subsection 24(e) above.  The Company shall give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  The Company shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares of the Company.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Rights will be effected.

Summary of Rights
 
 
 
The foregoing is a summary of certain principal terms of the Stockholder Rights Plan only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Preferred Stock Rights Agreement dated as of October 25, 2005 between the Company and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. as Rights Agent (the ).  The Rights Agreement may be amended from time to time.  A copy of the Rights Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Form 8-K dated October 27, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. ADOPTS STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
 
Santa Clara, California, October 26, 2005.  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, announced today that its board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan.  Under the plan, Align will issue a dividend of one right for each share of its common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2005.
 
The stockholder rights plan is designed to guard against partial tender offers and other coercive tactics to gain control of the company without offering a fair and adequate price and fair terms to all of Align's stockholders.  The plan was not adopted in response to any efforts to acquire the company, and the company is not aware of any such efforts.
 
Each right will initially entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of the company's preferred stock for $37.00.  However, the rights are not immediately exercisable and will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events.  If a person or group acquires, or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of, 15% or more of Align's common stock while the stockholder rights plan remains in place, then, unless the rights are redeemed by Align for $0.001 per right, the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders except the acquiring person or group for shares of Align or shares of the third-party acquirer having a value of twice the right's then-current exercise price.  Further details of the plan are outlined in a letter that will be mailed to stockholders as of the record date as well as in Align's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
About Align Technology, Inc.
 
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

          On December 16, 2005, Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company") and Comerica Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement").  The Amended Credit Agreement amends and replaces the Company's Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 20, 2002, as amended.  The Amended Credit Agreement increases the available borrowings under the revolving line of credit from $15 million to $20 million.  Included in the new revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to $5 million, a foreign exchange facility of up to $5 million and an equipment facility of up to $10 million.  The Company may elect interest rates on its borrowing calculated by reference to Comerica Bank's prime rate less one-half of one percent or LIBOR plus two percent.  The new credit facility matures on December 16, 2007, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid.
          The new credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth, and covenants limiting the Company's ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, be acquired, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends and repurchase stock.
          The new credit facility contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, material judgments, and unauthorized payments on subordinated debt.  The occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by 3.0% and could result in the acceleration of the Company's obligations under the new credit facility.
          As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company has no outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.  The foregoing description of the Amended Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the Amended Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by this reference.
          The information set forth under Item 1.01, "Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement," is incorporate herein by reference.

BORROWER AND BANK EACH HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW OR STATUTORY CLAIMS.

EFERENCE
ROVISION
In the event the Jury Trial Waiver set forth above is not enforceable, the parties elect to proceed under this Judicial Reference Provision.
                       12.1         
With the exception of the items specified in Section 12.3 below, any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a "Claim") between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (collectively in this Section, the "Comerica Documents"), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Comerica Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the state or federal court in the county or district where the real property involved in the action, if any, is located or in the state or federal court in the county or district where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the "Court").
                       12.2         
The matters that shall not be subject to a reference are the following: (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of any security interests in real or personal property, (ii) exercise of self-help remedies (including, without limitation, set-off), (iii) appointment of a receiver and (iv) temporary, provisional or ancillary remedies (including, without limitation, writs of attachment, writs of possession, temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions). This reference provision does not limit the right of any party to exercise or oppose any of the rights and remedies described in clauses (i) and (ii) or to seek or oppose from a court of competent jurisdiction any of the items described in clauses (iii) and (iv). The exercise of, or opposition to, any of those items does not waive the right of any party to a reference pursuant to this reference provision as provided herein.
                       12.3         
The referee shall be a retired judge or justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree within ten (10) days of a written request to do so by any party, then, upon request of any party, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an ex parte or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if ex parte relief is not granted.  Pursuant to CCP  170.6, each party shall have one peremptory challenge to the referee selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative).
                       12.4         
The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested, subject to change in the time periods specified herein for good cause shown, to (i) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (ii) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the conference and (iii) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision. 
                       12.5

All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding.
                       12.6

Pursuant to CCP  644, such decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court and any such decision will be final, binding and conclusive.  The parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee.  The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision. 
                       12.8         
If the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration.   The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act 1280 through 1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On December 22, 2005, Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") entered into a Shelter Agreement with International Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S. de R.L. ("IMS") (the "Shelter Agreement"). The Shelter Agreement replaces in its entirety the shelter services agreement dated June 3, 2002 between Elamex S.A. de C.V. ("Elamex") as such agreement was assigned, effective July 11, 2003, from Elamex to IMS (the "Prior Agreement"). Upon the execution of the Shelter Agreement the Prior Agreement was terminated. The original term of the Shelter Agreement expires on December 22, 2010. Such term may be extended by Align for successive two-year periods by providing notice to IMS prior to the end of the then current term. In addition to termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events, at any time after the end of the third year of the original term, IMS may terminate the Shelter Agreement with or without reason upon nine-months' notice and Align may terminate the Shelter Agreement with or without reason upon 90 days notice. Pursuant to the terms of the Shelter Agreement, Align and IMS will continue their previous relationship pursuant to new terms and conditions set forth therein. IMS will continue to provide and perform administrative services such as facilities and facility maintenance, human resource recruiting, management and administration, payroll accounting, Mexican accounts payable, cross-border logistics, management, employee medical programs, employee transportation and cafeteria services (the "Administrative Services"). In addition, IMS will continue to provide the facilities and personnel necessary for Align for the manufacture, assembly and production of Align's clear, removable aligners (the "Products") at IMS' facility located in Juarez, Mexico (the "Manufacturing Services" and together with the Administrative Services, referred to in this Form 8-K as the "Services"). Align will supply the materials, components and equipment used in and necessary for the production of the Products at the Premises (as defined in the next paragraph below). Align will reimburse IMS all expenses incurred by IMS on behalf of Align, plus an additional predetermined percentage of such expenses, if applicable. The Services are currently performed by IMS at a facility in Juarez, Mexico (the "Premises") that it leases from Elamex pursuant to a lease agreement with an expiration date of June 30, 2008 (the "Elamex Lease"). If IMS does not complete the purchase of the Premises by May 1, 2006, IMS is required to have obtained an extension of the Elamex Lease until at least November 1, 2010. If, however, IMS or its affiliate or assignee purchases the Premises then, among other things, IMS, as tenant, shall execute a 5-year lease with its affiliate or assignee, as landlord, which allows Align to use or occupy the space (the "IMS Lease"). In addition, if IMS or its affiliate or assignee purchase the Premises, then immediately upon the execution of the IMS Lease, Align agrees to execute a guaranty for the first five years of the IMS Lease in the form attached as Exhibit F to the Shelter Agreement. The summary of the Shelter Agreement provided above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Shelter Agreement which is attached as exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT Effective December 22, 2005, the Shelter Services Agreement between Align and Elamex, dated June 3, 2002 as such agreement was assigned, effective July 11, 2003, from Elamex to IMS (the "Prior Agreement") was terminated. The Shelter Agreement described in Item 1.01 above replaces in its entirety the Prior Agreement.

The term "Reimbursable Expense" is defined as any actual, out-of-pocket cost incurred by IMS, including taxes, on behalf of ALIGN for which reimbursement by ALIGN is required. Reimbursable Expenses shall be billed to ALIGN as per Pricing Matrix (Exhibit "D").

Should local or national tax authorities demand increases or decreases with respect to taxes paid by governmental authorities, the Headcount Employee cost presented in this Agreement and paid by ALIGN will be adjusted on a dollar per dollar basis. The cost basis of each invoice sent to ALIGN is converted from Pesos to US Dollars based on the current in effect exchange rate on the date of invoice and IMS will make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the most favorable exchange rate for ALIGN. Upon ALIGN'S request, IMS will provide back up information for each such exchange. In addition, if ALIGN does not agree with the exchange house used to complete the transaction, then IMS will work with ALIGN to find a mutually agreed exchange house for future exchange rates.

ALIGN/IMS Shelter Agreement EXHIBIT F GUARANTY THIS GUARANTY ("Guaranty") is made and entered into as of the __ day of ________________________, 2005, between ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC., represented herein by _____________________________ (hereinafter referred to as the "Guarantor"), and INMOBILIARIA PREMIER, S. DE R.L. DE C,V,, represented herein by __________________________ (hereinafter referred to as the "Lessor"). W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, Guarantor and International Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("IMS") have entered into a cross-border manufacturing transaction; WHEREAS, IMS and Lessor have entered into a Lease Agreement, dated ____________________________, a copy of which is attached hereto as Addendum "A"("Lease") regarding a portion of a facility comprising _______ sq. ft. and allocated common areas totaling _____________ sq. ft., located at Calle Mayas 7710, Parque Industrial Fernandez, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico; and WHEREAS, Lessor entered into a five (5) year Lease with IMS provided that Guarantor guarantees the performance of IMS for the first five (5) years of such Lease as contained herein; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, obligations and liabilities mutually exchanged and created herein and in the Lease, and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Guarantor agrees as follows: 1. To induce Lessor to enter into the Lease, Guarantor hereby, in accordance with the terms hereof, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Lessor, its heirs, legal representatives and assigns, the punctual payment of all monthly base rent (including occupancy costs such as CAM, taxes, utilities, insurance, etc.) (the "Obligations") for the first five (5) years of the Lease (the "Obligations Period"). That Lessor will provide prompt written notice to Guarantor if Lessor has been unable to pay any of its obligations under the Lease. 2. This is an irrevocable continuing guaranty that shall remain in effect until the expiration of the last statute of limitations period for any claims for the Obligations during the Obligations Period that Lessor may have against IMS. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Guarantor, this Guaranty shall not apply to any addendums, renewals, extensions, options, expansions, amendments and modifications of the Lease or of any Obligation there under. 3. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Obligations of IMS guaranteed hereunder shall affect, impair or be a defense to Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty, and this Guaranty shall be a primary obligation of Guarantor. The Obligations, covenants, agreements and duties of Guarantor under this Agreement shall in no way be affected or impaired by (i) the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting IMS or any of IMS' assets, or (ii) the release of IMS from the performance or observation of any of the Obligations by IMS' bankruptcy or other operation of law.
ALIGN/IMS Shelter Agreement 4. No failure by Lessor to insist upon the strict performance of any provision hereof or of the Lease or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent upon a breach of the Lease, and no submission by the Guarantor or IMS or acceptance by Lessor of full or partial rent or performance during the continuance of any such breach, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such provision. No waiver of any breach of the Lease or of this Agreement shall affect or alter this Agreement or the rights of Lessor with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach. 5. Guarantor agrees that Lessor may proceed against Guarantor directly and independently and that the cessation of the liability or responsibility of others for the Obligations for any reason other than full payment, shall not in anywise affect the liability of the Guarantor. The obligations of the Guarantor and those of any other guarantor or guarantors who may have guaranteed or who hereafter guaranty the Obligations are and will be joint and several, and Lessor may release or settle with any one or more of the guarantors at any time without affecting the continuing liability of the remaining guarantor or guarantors. 6. This Agreement is for the benefit of Lessor, and for such other persons as may from time to time be the assignee of Lessor and this Agreement shall be transferable and assignable with the same force and effect and to the same extent as the Lease may be assignable and transferable, it being understood that upon the assignment or transfer by Lessor of the Lease, the assignee of such Lease shall have all the rights granted to Lessor under this Agreement. Should Lessor have to enforce this Guaranty and collect for Obligations that IMS has failed to pay, Lessor acknowledges and agrees that IMS is obligated to assign and Lessor agrees to authorize, at Guarantor's sole election, all of its right, title and interest in the Lease to Guarantor, thereby replacing IMS as Lessee. In addition, upon written notification from IMS or ALIGN that the Shelter Agreement has terminated or has expired, IMS is obligated to assign, and Lessor agrees to authorize, at Guarantor's sole election, all of its right, title and interest in the Lease to Guarantor, wherein ALIGN will replace IMS as lessee under the Lease. Lessor hereby consents to such assignment of the Lease by IMS and assumption by Guarantor. 7. Lessor will give Guarantor notice of IMS' default in payment or performance of the Obligations and an opportunity to cure such default for thirty (30) business days after such notice is sent, prior to taking action to enforce this Guaranty against Guarantor. Unless and until the Obligations have been satisfied in full, Guarantor hereby further waives all of its rights of subrogation, contribution and reimbursement which it would otherwise have against IMS in the event Guarantor suffers any liability under this Guaranty. 8. No agreement exists between Guarantor and Lessor other than as set forth herein. The rights and remedies of Lessor under this Guaranty and any others otherwise created are cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently, and the exercise of any one or more of them will not be a waiver of any other. No acts, delay, or omission or course of dealing between Lessor and IMS or Guarantor will act as a waiver of any of Lessor's rights or remedies under this Agreement, and no wavier, change, modification or discharge of this Agreement or any obligation created hereby will be effective unless in writing signed by Lessor. 9. Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it has investigated fully the benefits and advantages which will be derived by Guarantor from execution of this Guaranty, and the Guarantor does hereby acknowledge, warrant and represent that a direct or indirect benefit will accrue to Guarantor by reason of execution of this Guaranty.
ALIGN/IMS Shelter Agreement 10. In an action for the interpretation and performance of this Guaranty, Guarantor and Lessor each agrees to submit itself in the jurisdiction of the Federal or State District Court, in the State of New York, United States of America.

(g) Arbitration. Each party agrees that any and all disputes ----------- which arise out of or relate to the Executive's employment, the termination of the Executive's employment, or the terms of this Agreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Such arbitration shall be in lieu of any trial before a judge and/or jury, and the Executive and Company expressly waive all rights to have such disputes resolved via trial before a judge and/or jury. Such disputes shall include, without limitation, claims for breach of contract or of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claims of discrimination, claims under any federal, state or local law or regulation now in existence or hereinafter enacted and as amended from time to time concerning in any way the subject of the Executive's employment with the Company or its termination.

Arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California or, if the Executive does not reside within 100 miles of Santa Clara County at the time the dispute arises, then the arbitration may take place in the largest metropolitan area within 50 miles of the Executive's place of residence when the dispute arises. During the course of the arbitration, the Executive and the Company will each bear equally the arbitrator's fee and any other type of expense or cost of arbitration, unless applicable law requires otherwise, and each shall bear their own respective attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator will not have authority to award attorneys' fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. In such case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys' fees as required or permitted by the applicable statute or contract. If there is a dispute as to whether the Executive or the Company is the prevailing party in the arbitration, the arbitrator will decide this issue.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award that sets forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief authorized by law in connection with the asserted claims or disputes. The arbitrator's award shall be subject to correction, confirmation, or vacation, as provided by applicable law setting forth the standard of judicial review of arbitration awards. Judgment upon the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. (h) No Assignment. This Agreement and all rights and ------------- obligations of the Executive hereunder are personal to the Executive and may not be transferred or assigned by the Executive at any time. The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that assumes the Company's obligations hereunder in connection with any sale or transfer of all or a substantial portion of the Company's assets to such entity. (i) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or ------------ more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. [The remainder of this page intentionally left blank.]
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has executed this Agreement, in the case of the Company by its duly authorized officer, as of the day and year first above written.

In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. NON-GAAP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Align uses a non-GAAP measure of net profit, which is adjusted to exclude certain costs and expenses and any associated tax effects of such adjustments. We believe that our non-GAAP net profit gives an indication of our baseline performance before other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, our non-GAAP net profit is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net profit prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On February 1, 2006, Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") entered into a settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with Ormco Corporation ("Ormco") and Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. ("AOA"). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the issues of past damages, willfulness and attorneys' fees for Ormco's and AOA's adjudged infringement of Align's U.S. Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 (the "Align Patents") through the manufacture and sale by Ormco and AOA of its Red, White & Blue appliances has been settled. The Settlement Agreement does not affect (1) Ormco and AOA's currently pending appeal of the permanent injunction preventing Ormco and AOA from selling the infringing Red, White & Blue system; (2) any appeal by Ormco of the decisions and orders by the United States District Court relating to Ormco's patents; or (3) any appeal by Align of the orders of the United States District Court relating to Align's patents. See Align's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 31, 2005 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2005 for a summary of the Ormco/AOA litigation.

The Settlement Amount will be paid into escrow pending the completion of the appeals process. Align's receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the Court, in a final, non-appealable judgment, finding that Ormco or AOA infringes at least one of the claims in the Align Patents. If, however, the Court issues a final, non-appealable judgment of non-infringment, invalidity or unenforceability with respect to each asserted claim of the Align Patents, all funds in the escrow account will be returned to Ormco and AOA.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") has recently been informed by the FDA that its Invisalign(R) system, a proprietary method for treating the misalignment of teeth using a series of clear, removable aligners has been classified as a Class II medical device, correcting what the FDA described as a prior classification error. The Invisalign system was previously regulated as a Class I medical device and was exempted from requiring pre-market clearance by the FDA prior to commercial launch. In November 1998, however, Align voluntarily filed and subsequently received pre-market clearance by the FDA to market the Invisalign system. Class II devices typically require pre-market clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process. As a result of this corrected classification, firms that now wish to market aligners for general use in the United States are required to obtain pre-market clearance from the FDA prior to commercialization. Align currently possesses the necessary 510(k) clearance from the FDA to continue to market its product under the Class II classification. Prior to this classification correction, our product development, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, handling, storage and distribution activities were subject to extensive oversight by the FDA. Align believes its Invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the Invisalign system. Align does not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the Class II classification.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

REPORTS Q1 2006 REVENUES OF $48.9M Santa Clara, Calif. - April 26, 2006 - Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2006. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2006 were $48.9 million, compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, a decrease of 4.4 percent. "The first quarter represented a good start to the year for Align, as case volumes and utilization grew significantly," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "Continuing volume growth and increasing revenues in the face of recent pricing changes and mix shift are central to our business plan this year. As we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver value to our customers, adoption of Invisalign as an important part of their practice will grow." The net loss for the first quarter of 2006, as reported on a GAAP basis, was $4.8 million, or loss per share of $0.08. This compares to GAAP net profit of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2005, or EPS of $0.03. The non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2006, which excludes $2.2 million from the expensing of stock options pursuant to FAS 123R, was $2.6 million, or non-GAAP loss per share of $0.04. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2005, which excludes $12 thousand of stock-based compensation, or non-GAAP EPS of $0.03. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for net profit (loss) for the first quarter of 2006 is set forth below within Align Technology's financial statements.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in April 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

Forward-Looking Statement - ------------------------- This news release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's focus on continuing volume growth and increasing revenues despite recent pricing changes and product mix shift, as well as its belief that continued execution of its strategy will increase adoption of Invisalign by its customers. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, including expenses related to the OrthoClear litigation, customer demand for Invisalign, acceptance of Invisalign by consumers and dental professionals, Align's third party manufacturing processes and personnel, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and new competitors, such as OrthoClear, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products, and the loss of key personnel, including members of its direct sales force. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2006, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. NON-GAAP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of gross profit, profit (loss) from operations, net profit (loss) and certain expenses (including sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development), which exclude stock-based compensation to allow for a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods that did not include FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation.

          On January 11, 2006, Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company") filed a formal complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (the "ITC") against OrthoClear Inc. ("OrthoClear"), seeking to halt the importation into the United States of infringing aligners manufactured by OrthoClear in Pakistan in violation of its patents and other intellectual property rights (the "ITC Complaint").  Pursuant to a scheduling order issued by the administrative law judge, the hearing on the ITC Complaint is currently set to take place from November 6-16, 2006 in Washington, D.C.  The scheduling order sets February 15, 2007 as the target date for the initial determination and May 15, 2007 as the target date for completion of the ITC investigation. 
          On Friday, July 28, 2006, the Company filed a motion entitled "Complainant's Motion to Modify the Target Date and Revise the Procedural Schedule" requesting the hearing on the ITC Complaint be rescheduled for December 5-15, 2006 and proposing a new target date for the initial determination as March 30, 2007 and proposing July 30, 2007 as the target date for completion of the ITC investigation.

Exhibit 99.1 ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. RECEIVES OFFICIAL ACTIONS IN REEXAMINATION PROCEEDINGS SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") has recently issued official actions in Reexamination proceedings relating to Align's U.S. Patent Nos. 6,217,325 (the '325 patent) and 6,309,215 (the '215 patent). Both patents relate to the Invisalign system and have been the subject of reexamination proceedings in the PTO provoked by an unnamed petitioner. On July 25, 2006, the PTO issued an "Office Action" with regard to the reexamination of the '325 patent. The '325 patent had originally issued in 2001 with 26 claims. Fifteen additional claims were added by Align in the reexamination. In its July 25th Office Action the PTO confirmed the patentability of 32 claims. Align presently intends to pursue, in continuing proceedings, the allowance of the rejected claims. On July 27, 2006, the PTO issued a "Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate" with regard to Align's '215 patent. With this Notice the PTO has now closed prosecution on the merits in the reexamination and affirmed, in the face of all the prior art cited against the patent by the unnamed petitioner, the patentability of all of Align's 42 claims pending in the reexamination. While the '215 patent entered the reexamination proceedings with 16 claims, additional claims were added in the reexamination by Align and the '215 patent will now leave the proceedings as a valid and enforceable patent with 42 claims. "We are extremely pleased at the promptness of the PTO in confirming the validity of the Align claims in the '325 and '215 reexamination proceedings," said Roger E. George, Vice President, Legal and General Counsel. "While a staggering amount of prior art was asserted in the reexaminations against these claims, including all the art asserted by an unnamed party, the PTO has duly considered the art and confirmed the validity of an even greater number of claims than were contained in the patents as they were originally issued several years ago. These actions by the PTO reaffirm our confidence in the strength and value of the inventions claimed in Align's broad patent portfolio." About Align Technology, Inc. Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

ITEM 8.01 Other Events
          On January 11, 2006, Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company") filed a formal complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (the "ITC") against OrthoClear Inc. ("OrthoClear"), seeking to halt the importation into the United States of infringing aligners manufactured by OrthoClear in Pakistan in violation of its patents and other intellectual property rights (the "ITC Complaint").  Pursuant to a scheduling order issued by the administrative law judge, the hearing on the ITC Complaint is currently set to take place from November 6-16, 2006 in Washington, D.C.  The scheduling order sets February 15, 2007 as the target date for the initial determination and May 15, 2007 as the target date for completion of the ITC investigation. 
          On Friday, July 28, 2006, the Company filed a motion entitled "Complainant's Motion to Modify the Target Date and Revise the Procedural Schedule" requesting the hearing on the ITC Complaint be rescheduled for December 5-15, 2006 and proposing a new target date for the initial determination as March 30, 2007 and proposing July 30, 2007 as the target date for completion of the ITC investigation (the "Motion").  The Company's reason for making the Motion is to allow additional time for discovery in light of alleged discovery abuses by OrthoClear. 
          On Monday, August 7, 2006, the administrative law judge issued an order denying, without prejudice, the Motion.   The judge, however, has reserved the right to modify schedule if the Company's pending discovery motions are granted and in granting these motions he determines that additional time is needed.  In addition, the judge intends to review the schedule after the mandatory settlement conference scheduled for September 18, 2006. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM 8.01 Other Events
          On January 11, 2006, Align Technology, Inc. (the "Company")  filed a federal court patent infringement action against OrthoClear, Inc. ("OrthoClear") in the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison) (the "Patent Infringement Federal Action") asserting infringement of the Company's U.S. Patents Nos. 6,685,469; 6,450,807; 6,394,801; 6,398,548; 6,722,880; 6,629,840; 6,669,037; 6,318,994; 6,729,876; 6,602,070; 6,471,511 and 6,227,850. The Patent Infringement Federal Action seeks monetary damages and an injunction to augment the exclusionary relief available from the ITC.
          On February 6, 2006,  OrthoClear filed a motion to stay the Patent Infringement Federal Action, pursuant to the mandatory stay provisions of the United States International Trade Commission ("ITC"), pending the outcome of the litigation of the same patents in the ITC proceedings.  The Company did not oppose the motion to stay. On March 10, 2006, the Court granted OrthoClear's unopposed motion to stay, thereby staying the matter pending resolution of the ITC proceedings. 
          On August 10, 2006, the Court, on its own motion, dismissed the Patent Infringement Federal Action without prejudice to its reopening upon the completion of the ITC proceedings.  In addition, the judge ordered that, upon a reopening of the Patent Infringement Federal Action, it will be placed at the head of the docket for immediate judicial attention.
  A summary of the ITC proceedings is contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REVERSES DISTRICT COURT AND FINDS SIX ALIGN TECHNOLOGY PATENT CLAIMS TO BE OBVIOUS SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires or brackets, learned today that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) has declared two out of a total of seventy-one claims in Align's US Patent No. 6,398,548 (the '548 patent) and four out of a total of ten claims in US Patent No. 6,544,611 (the '611 patent) to be invalid as "obvious." The CAFC's decision reverses an earlier California District Court decision that upheld the validity of these claims in a patent infringement suit between Ormco Corporation and Align. The claims in question address, in addition to other things, the marking of appliances to indicate order of use. The majority of the claims in the '548 patent, including claims that address methods of fabricating aligners, digital data sets or computer-generated models to fabricate appliances, are unaffected by the appeal and the CAFC's ruling. The '611 patent does not contain claims related to digital data, computer-generated models, or methods of fabrication. US Patent No. 6,398,548 The '548 patent consists of seventy-one claims; only claims 10 and 17 were at issue in the appeal and CAFC ruling. These two claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning teeth from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show order of use. These claims contain further limitations requiring instructions as to order in which the appliances are to be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of 2-20 days. US Patent No. 6,544,611 The '611 patent consists of ten claims directed to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate appliances and a final appliance, provided in a single package, as well as instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn. The CAFC's ruling pertains only to claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the patent. The six claims deemed obvious by the CAFC are not involved in the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) ongoing investigation into OrthoClear Inc.'s alleged infringement of numerous Align patents. The '548 and '611 patents are two of seventy-three total U.S. patents in Align's portfolio. Align is currently considering whether to seek rehearing of the CAFC's decision or to pursue other options.

(g) Arbitration. Each party agrees that any and all disputes which arise out of or relate to the Executive's employment, the termination of the Executive's employment, or the terms of this Agreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Such arbitration shall be in lieu of any trial before a judge and/or jury, and the Executive and Company expressly waive all rights to have such disputes resolved via trial before a judge and/or jury. Such disputes shall include, without limitation, claims for breach of contract or of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claims of discrimination, claims under any federal, state or local law or regulation now in existence or hereinafter enacted and as amended from time to time concerning in any way the subject of the Executive's employment with the Company or its termination.

Arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California or, if the Executive does not reside within 100 miles of Santa Clara County at the time the dispute arises, then the arbitration may take place in the largest metropolitan area within 50 miles of the Executive's place of residence when the dispute arises. During the course of the arbitration, the Executive and the Company will each bear equally the arbitrator's fee and any other type of expense or cost of arbitration, unless applicable law requires otherwise, and each shall bear their own respective attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator will not have authority to award attorneys' fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. In such case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys' fees as required or permitted by the applicable statute or contract. If there is a dispute as to whether the Executive or the Company is the prevailing party in the arbitration, the arbitrator will decide this issue. 7.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award that sets forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief authorized by law in connection with the asserted claims or disputes. The arbitrator's award shall be subject to correction, confirmation, or vacation, as provided by applicable law setting forth the standard of judicial review of arbitration awards. Judgment upon the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. (h) No Assignment. This Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Executive hereunder are personal to the Executive and may not be transferred or assigned by the Executive at any time. The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that assumes the Company's obligations hereunder in connection with any sale or transfer of all or a substantial portion of the Company's assets to such entity.

Assignment of Inventions. Subject to Section 2.6 and except for those Inventions which I can prove qualify fully under the provisions of California Labor Code 2870 (as set forth in Exhibit A), I hereby assign and agree to assign in the future (when any such Inventions or Proprietary Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to the Company all my right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Proprietary Rights with respect thereto). I will, at the Company's request, promptly execute a written assignment to the Company of any such Company Invention, and I will preserve any such Invention as part of the Proprietary Information of the Company (the "Company Inventions"). 2.5.

I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith. 4. RETURN OF COMPANY DOCUMENTS. Upon termination of my employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, voluntarily or involuntarily, and at any earlier time the Company requests, I will deliver to the person designated by the Company all originals and copies of all documents and other property of the Company in my possession, under my control or to which I may have access. I will not reproduce or appropriate for my own use, or for the use of others, any property, Proprietary Information or Company Inventions. 5. LEGAL AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES. Because my services are personal and unique and because I may have access to and become acquainted with the Proprietary Information of the Company, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement. 6.

GENERAL PROVISIONS. This Agreement will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of California, as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents.

No waiver by the Company of any right under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other right.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as consent by any current or former OrthoClear Witness to deposition in any location other than his or her principal residence. 3
7. Releases. The Parties shall execute general releases of all claims, known or unknown, between them, with the exception that as between Align and Tran, Align and Tran shall mutually release each other from all claims, known or unknown, that are related to OrthoClear or any current litigation.

The Binding Settlement Term Sheet includes the following terms: -- Effective immediately, OrthoClear will stop accepting new patient cases for treatment; -- OrthoClear will consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC), enforced by the United States Customs Service, which prevents OrthoClear from importing its dental aligner products into the U.S., either directly or through a third party; -- OrthoClear and Zia Chishti, its CEO, and Charlie Wen, its President, will transfer and assign to Align all intellectual property rights with application to the treatment of malocclusion; -- OrthoClear principals Zia Chishti, Charlie Wen, Peter Riepenhausen, and Christopher Kawaja will sign 5-year, global non-compete agreements in the field of removable aligner therapy products and related software market; -- OrthoClear employees Joe Breeland and Jeff Tunnell will sign 5-year U.S. non-compete agreements prohibiting their personal participation in the removable aligner therapy product and related software market; -- Align will make Invisalign treatment available to OrthoClear patients in the United States, Canada and Hong Kong at no charge from Align; -- The Parties will dismiss all pending litigation against each other and release all related claims; -- Align will make a one-time cash payment of $10 million to OrthoClear Holdings, Inc. "This resolution achieves all of Align's litigation objectives and allows us to fully focus the Company's energies and resources on providing innovative products and excellent service to Invisalign customers," said Thomas M.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

I.
             
BACKGROUND
On February 9, 2006, the United States International Trade Commission instituted the above-captioned investigation under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, based upon the complaint filed by Align, which alleged unfair acts in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation and the sale within the United States after importation of certain incremental dental positioning adjustment appliances by OrthoClear. 71 Fed. Reg. 7995 (Feb. 15, 2006).
See
The Complaint alleges that OrthoClear is engaging in unlawful and unfair acts of competition in violation of Section 337 by importing into the United States, selling for importation into the United States and selling within the United States after importation certain incremental dental positioning adjustment appliances that infringe, or are made, produced, or processed by means of a process covered by, valid claims of each of the following United States Letters Patent: (i) U.S. Patent No. 6,685,469 ("the 469 patent"); (ii) U.S. Patent No. 6,394,801 ("the 801 patent"); (iii) U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548 ("the 548 patent"); (iv) U.S. Patent No. 6,722,880 ("the 880 patent"); (v) U.S. Patent No. 6,629,840 ("the 840 patent"); (vi) U.S. Patent No. 6,699,037 ("the 037 patent"); (vii) U.S. Patent No. 6,318,994 ("the 994 patent"); (viii) U.S. Patent No. 6,729,876 ("the 876 patent"); (ix) U.S. Patent No. 6,602,070 ("the 070 patent"); (x) U.S. Patent No. 6,471,511 ("the 511 patent"); and (xi) U.S. Patent No. 6,227,850 ("the 850 patent") (collectively "the Patents-In-Suit"). (On July 20, 2006, the Commission determined not to review the July 12, 2006 Initial Determination of the Administrative Law Judge granting Align's motion for partial termination of the investigation as to U.S. Patent No. 6,540,807 on July 12, 2006. See Order No. 10).
2
The Complaint also alleges that OrthoClear is engaging in unlawful and unfair acts of competition in violation of Section 337 by misappropriation of Align's trade secrets in connection with OrthoClear's importation into the United States, selling for importation into the United States and selling within the United States after importation the articles at issue in this proceeding.
II.
           
THE JOINT MOTION COMPLIES WITH COMMISSION RULES GOVERNING TERMINATION OF AN INVESTIGATION BY ENTRY OF CONSENT ORDER
Termination of an investigation under Section 337 is governed by Commission Rule 210.21. That rule provides, that "any party may move at any time for an order to terminate an investigation" on the basis of a consent order. Commission Rule 210.21(a)(2). Specifically, the rule states that:
inter alia,
[A] proposal to terminate by consent order shall be submitted as a motion to the administrative law judge with a stipulation that incorporates a proposed consent order...At any time prior to the commencement of the hearing, the motion may be filed by one or more respondents, and may be filed jointly with other parties to the investigation... The administrative law judge shall promptly file with the Commission an initial determination regarding the motion for termination if the motion is granted...Pending disposition by the Commission of a consent order stipulation, a party may not, absent good cause shown, withdraw from the stipulation once it has been submitted pursuant to this section.
Commission Rule 210.21 (c)( 1 )(ii).
The Joint Motion complies with the Commission Rule that a request to terminate an investigation on the basis of a consent order be accompanied by a Consent Order Stipulation that incorporates a Proposed Consent Order. USITC Inv. No. 337-TA-566, Order No. 4: Initial

Determination Terminating the Investigation by Entry of a Consent Order, 2006 WL 1642253 (U.S.I.T.C.) at *1.
The Consent Order Stipulation also contains all of the admissions, waivers, statements and other requirements set forth in Commission Rule 210.21(c)(3). (describing the respondent's admission of jurisdiction over the accused products subject to that investigation and jurisdiction over the respondent, in addition to meeting all of the requirements of Commission Rule 210.21(c)(i)(A) and (B)).

Likewise, the Proposed Consent Order also contains a statement that OrthoClear will not import, sell for importation, or sell within the United States after importation, the accused articles. USITC Inv. No. 337-TA-550, Order No. 10: Denying Respondent's Motion to Terminate and Entry of Consent Order, 2005 WL 3346206 (U.S.I.T.C), at *4 (noting that, "[a]s the Staff correctly points out, a consent order is essentially an agreement between the Commission and the respondent whereby the respondent agrees to cease engaging in the allegedly unfair act. Staff Response at 2. Thus, consent orders that have formed the basis for the termination of an investigation have contained language pursuant to which the respondent agrees to refrain from importing, selling for importation, or selling within[] the United States after importation, the accused articles.").

REPORTS Q3 2006 REVENUES OF $49.0 MILLION Santa Clara, Calif. - October 25, 2006 - Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2006. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2006 were $49.0 million, compared to $50.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of 3.6 percent. "The third quarter was a busy one for Align," stated Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology's President and CEO. "Over 1,100 doctors used Invisalign for the first time and we trained almost 1,000 new doctors. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we announced our intent to sign a definitive agreement with OrthoClear - which we did earlier this month - ending all pending litigation matters with them. With the litigation now behind us and our base of doctors growing, we can focus entirely on growing the top line. We will generate that growth through increased adoption of Invisalign by dentists and orthodontists as the Invisalign product evolves to better meet their specific needs. Our goal is to return to profitability and increase value for our shareholders, customers, and employees." The net loss for the third quarter of 2006, as reported on a GAAP basis, was $10.3 million, or loss per share of $0.16. This compares to GAAP net loss of $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2005, or loss per share of $0.02.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in April 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. To learn more about Invisalign or to find a certified Invisalign doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com or call 1-800-INVISIBLE.
Forward-Looking Statement This news release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's expectation that it will generate revenue growth through increased adoption of Invisalign by dentists and orthodontists by evolving the Invisalign system to better meet their specific needs. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, including expenses related to the OrthoClear settlement, customer demand for Invisalign, acceptance of Invisalign by consumers and dental professionals, Align's third party manufacturing processes and personnel, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel, including members of its direct sales force. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2006, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Exhibit 99.1 ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. ANNOUNCES Q4 2006 AND FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTS * 4th Quarter Total Revenues Grew 8% to $55.2 Million * Fiscal 2006 Total Revenues of $206.4 Million; GAAP Net Loss of $35.0 Million, or $0.55 per share * Excluding One-Time Items and Stock-Based Compensation, Fiscal Year 2006 non-GAAP Net Loss of $11.7 Million, or $0.19 per share * Case Shipments Increased 22% Year Over Year * 2007 Revenues Expected Between $240.0-255.0 Million SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2006. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $55.2 million, compared to $51.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 7.9 percent. For fiscal year 2006, Align reported revenues of $206.4 million, compared to $207.1 million for fiscal year 2005, a decrease of 0.4 percent. "2006 was eventful and productive," stated Thomas M. Prescott, President and CEO of Align Technology. "We resolved our legal disputes with OrthoClear and refocused our efforts on product development, customer service and market expansion. Overall, we shipped a record number of cases and our base of doctors grew tremendously. We expect 2007 to be the year we restage growth, introduce products that meet the unique needs of the Orthodontists and GPs and continue our path to profitability." Revenue Analysis Revenue was $55.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 7.9% from the fourth quarter of 2005, and $206.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 0.4% over the prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenue per channel was: * $17.4 million for U.S. Ortho, including $2.0 million for Invisalign Express; * $24.5 million for U.S. GP, including $2.9 million for Invisalign Express; * $9.6 million for International; and * $3.7 million for Other. Key metrics include: * 3,700 U.S. Orthos, 9,000 U.S. GPs, and 2,100 International doctors submitted cases in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, cases were shipped to 3,400 U.S. Orthos, 7,900 U.S. GPs and 1,900 International doctors. * Utilization in the fourth quarter of 2006 was 4.2 for U.S. Orthos, 2.4 for U.S. GPs, and 2.9 for International. Utilization in the ortho channel declined because a large number of doctors, who had not started cases in the previous year, started new Invisalign cases in the fourth quarter. Utilization was flat in the U.S. GP channel and slightly up in international. * In the fourth quarter, worldwide average selling price (ASP) for Invisalign was $1,320. Excluding Invisalign Express, worldwide ASP was $1,445. * Total number of cases shipped in fiscal year 2006 increased 22% to 150,100. Included in this were 36,600 Invisalign Express cases. * Doctors trained worldwide in fiscal year 2006 increased by 5,000, including 3,800 U.S. GP dentists, to a cumulative total of 40,800.
* Since product inception, 28,700 doctors worldwide have used Invisalign: 6,200 U.S. Orthos; 17,200 U.S. GPs; and 5,300 International doctors. 84 percent of these doctors have started more than one case. A full list of quarterly metrics is available in the Fact Sheet following the financial tables of this release. Additionally, quarterly metric information for the last 8 quarters is available on Align's website at investor.aligntech.com. Operating results reflect stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million for Q4 and $8.9 million for full year 2006 due to the implementation of FAS 123( R ) in the first quarter of 2006. It also reflects $14.3 million of one- time costs incurred from our agreement with OrthoClear including settlement costs and costs associated with the Patients First Program.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. To learn more about Invisalign or to find a certified Invisalign doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com or call 1-800-INVISIBLE.
About non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, profit (loss) from operations, net profit (loss) and certain expenses (including sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development), which exclude stock-based compensation and the Patients First Program and settlement costs. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" and "Business Outlook" included at the end of this release. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance." Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature, such as the Patients First Program and settlement costs. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Forward-Looking Statement This news release, including the tables below, contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's anticipated financial results and certain business metrics for the first quarter and full year of 2007, including anticipated percentage of revenue by channel, case shipments and average selling prices, and statements by Mr. Prescott regarding introduction of new products and anticipated return to profitability in fiscal 2007. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, including expenses related to the OrthoClear settlement, customer demand for Invisalign, acceptance of Invisalign by consumers and dental professionals, Align's third party manufacturing processes and personnel, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel, including members of its direct sales force. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2006, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign(R), a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2007. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2007 were $63.8 million, compared to $48.9 million in the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 30.4 percent. "We are pleased that we are off to a strong start in 2007," stated Thomas M. Prescott, President and CEO of Align Technology. "Improved operating performance yielded a welcome return to profitability, and our solid growth in volume and revenue on an increasing base of customers is very gratifying. We are committed to evolving our products to meet the specific needs of our Orthodontists and GP Dentists, which is key to generating and sustaining our top line growth." First Quarter 2007 Revenue Analysis - ----------------------------------- Revenue was $63.8 million for the first quarter, an increase of 30.4% from the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter, revenue per channel was: o $21.5 million for U.S. Ortho, including $2.1 million for Invisalign Express; o $29.8 million for U.S. GP, including $2.8 million for Invisalign Express; o $9.2 million for International; and o $3.3 million for Training and Other.
(2-2-2) Key metrics include: o 3,800 U.S. Orthos, 9,700 U.S. GPs and 2,100 International doctors submitted cases in the first quarter. Also in the first quarter, cases were shipped to 3,600 U.S. Orthos, 8,700 U.S. GPs and 2,000 International doctors. o Utilization in the first quarter of 2007 was 4.8 for U.S. Orthos, 2.6 for U.S. GPs and 2.8 for International. Sequentially, utilization rates increased for U.S. Orthos and U.S. GPs on a growing base of participating doctors. Utilization rates have remained consistent for International. o In the first quarter, worldwide average selling price (ASP) for Invisalign was $1,340. Excluding Invisalign Express, worldwide ASP was $1,450. o Total number of cases shipped increased 23 percent year over year to 45,000. Included in this were 6,700 Invisalign Express cases. o Doctors trained worldwide in the first quarter increased by 1,800, including 1,300 U.S. GP dentists, to a cumulative total of 42,600. o Since product inception, 30,100 doctors worldwide have used Invisalign: 6,400 U.S. Orthos; 18,200 U.S. GPs; and 5,500 International doctors. 84 percent of these doctors have started more than one case. A full list of quarterly metrics is available in the Fact Sheet following the financial tables of this release. Additionally, quarterly metric information for the last 9 quarters is available on Align's website at investor.aligntech.com. Operating results reflect stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million for Q1. It also reflects a reversal of $1.8 million of the $8.3 million expense we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the Patients First Program. The expense reversal results from a reduction in the number of cases and associated costs we will incur to fulfill our obligations under the Patients First Program. These items have been excluded in the non-GAAP financials. A reconciliation of GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) to non-GAAP results and outlook is contained in the tables below. First Quarter 2007 Operating Results - ------------------------------------ Key GAAP operating results for the first quarter of 2007 include: o Gross margin was 72.5 percent, compared to 70.8 percent in the first quarter 2006. o Operating expenses were $39.2 million, compared to $39.8 million in the first quarter 2006. First quarter 2007 operating expense includes the $1.8 million reduction in the cost of completing the Patients First Program cases. o Net profit was $7.0 million, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million in the first quarter 2006. o Earnings per share was $0.10, compared to a loss per share of $0.08 in the first quarter 2006.
(3-3-3) Key non-GAAP operating results for the first quarter of 2007 include: o Gross margin was 72.9 percent, compared to 71.1 percent in the first quarter 2006. o Operating expenses were $38.7 million, compared to $37.8 million in the first quarter 2006. o Net profit was $7.6 million, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the first quarter 2006. o Earnings per share was $0.11, compared to a loss per share of $0.04 in the first quarter 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources - ------------------------------- As of March 31, 2007, Align had $65.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash, compared to $64.1 million as of December 31, 2006. During the first quarter Align reduced the borrowings against its credit facility by $3.5 million. $8.0 million remains outstanding. Patients First Program Update - ----------------------------- The fourth quarter of 2006 included an $8.3 million operating expense for the anticipated cost of completing the 30,500 registered Patients First Program cases. As of March 31, 2007, Align had received 24,700 of the 30,500 registered cases. In accordance with the Patients First Program terms and conditions, the program was closed to receipt of additional cases as of March 30, 2007. As a result, the first quarter includes a $1.8 million reversal of operating expense to reflect the reduction in the number of cases and associated costs we will incur to fulfill our obligation under the program. 16,300 cases have been shipped as of March 31, 2007 with the remaining 8,400 in process cases expected to ship in the second quarter of 2007.

About Align Technology, Inc. - ---------------------------- Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. To learn more about Invisalign or to find a certified Invisalign doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com or call 1-800-INVISIBLE. About non-GAAP Financial Measures - --------------------------------- To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, profit (loss) from operations, net profit (loss) and certain expenses (including sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development), which exclude stock-based compensation and the Patients First Program reversal. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" and "Business Outlook" included at the end of this release. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents
(5-5-5) Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature, such as the Patients First Program. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Forward-Looking Statement - ------------------------- This news release, including the tables below, contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's anticipated financial results and certain business metrics for the second quarter and full year of 2007, including anticipated revenue, operating expense, earnings per share, percentage of revenue by channel, case shipments and average selling prices, and statements regarding the anticipated timing of the completion of the remaining Patients First Program cases. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, continued customer demand for Invisalign, including during the summer vacation periods in the United States and Europe in the third quarter, acceptance of Invisalign by consumers and dental professionals, Align's third party manufacturing processes and personnel, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel, including members of its direct sales force. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2007, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. # # #

Santa Clara, Calif. - July 25, 2007 - Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), the inventor of Invisalign, a proprietary method of straightening teeth without wires and brackets, today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2007, ended June 30, 2007. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2007 (Q2 07) were a record $76.6 million, a sequential increase of 20 percent compared to $63.8 million in the first quarter of 2007 (Q1 07) and a year-over-year increase of 44 percent compared to $53.2 million in the second quarter of 2006 (Q2 06).
Our second quarter results were outstanding by any measure and we are very pleased to deliver our second consecutive record quarter, said Thomas M. Prescott, President and CEO of Align Technology. Consumer demand and physician interest in the Invisalign system continue to expand, enabling case and revenue growth and increased profitability. Beyond our financial results, we continue to make progress on new product and technology development, and other key strategic objectives.
On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, net profit for Q2 07 was $13.6 million, or $0.19 per share diluted. This reflects an increase in GAAP net profit of 94 percent from $7.0 million, or $0.10 per share diluted in Q1 07, and an increase from a GAAP net loss of $2.6 million, or $0.04 loss per share diluted in Q2 06.
 
Non-GAAP net profit for Q2 07 was $16.5 million, or $0.23 per share diluted. This reflects an increase in non-GAAP net profit of 116 percent from $7.6 million, or $0.11 per share diluted in Q1 07, and an increase from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.01 loss per share diluted in Q2 06. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables included herein.
 
 
Q2 07 Operating Results
Operating results reflect stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for Q2 07, and includes a one-time $1.6 million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs associated with OrthoClear litigation.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2007, Align had $82.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash, compared to $64.1 million as of December 31, 2006. During the second quarter the Company paid off the remaining $8 million of its credit facility and has no outstanding balance, under the credit facility, as of June 30, 2007.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, profit (loss) from operations, net profit (loss), earnings (loss) per share, and certain expenses (including sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development), which exclude stock-based compensation and the Patients First Program charge. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2007, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

FOR RELEASE ON OCTOBER 24 AT 4:01 PM EASTERN TIME
 
Santa Clara, Calif. - October 24, 2007 - Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2007. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2007 (Q3 07) were $71.5 million. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 46 percent compared to $49.0 million in the third quarter of 2006 (Q3 06). On a sequential basis revenues decreased 7 percent in a seasonally slower quarter, compared to $76.6 million in the second quarter of 2007 (Q2 07). As disclosed previously, Q2 07 revenues of $76.6 million included $5.2 million in backlog shipments caused by the allocation of capacity to the Patients First Program during prior quarters.
Im pleased with the financial results for the third quarter with revenue growth of 46 percent year over year and EPS four cents higher than expectations. Continued improvement from operations and stable ASPs resulted in stronger than expected gross margin of 74.6 percent, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology. We continue to see strong consumer interest for the Invisalign system and demand for doctor certification remains high.
On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, net profit for Q3 07 was $9.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. This reflects a significant increase from a GAAP net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.16 loss per diluted share in Q3 06, and a decrease in GAAP net profit from $13.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in Q2 07.
 
Non-GAAP net profit for Q3 07 was $12.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share. This reflects a significant increase from a non-GAAP net loss of $8.0 million, or $0.13 loss per diluted share in Q3 06, and a decrease in non-GAAP net profit from $16.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share in Q2 07. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables included below.
Q3 07 Operating Results
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2007, Align had $110.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash, compared to $64.1 million as of December 31, 2006.

For the fourth quarter 2007 (Q4 07), Align Technology expects revenues to increase 26 to 31 percent year over year and be in a range of $69.5 million and $72.2 million.

For fiscal 2007, Align Technology expects revenues to increase 36 to 38 percent year over year and be in a range of $281.3 and $284.0 million.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release of Align Technology, Inc. dated January 29, 2008

Align Technology Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2007 Results Fiscal 2007 Net Revenues of $284.3 Million Increase 38 Percent - Q4 Net Revenue of $72.5 Million Increase 31 Percent Year Over Year - Q4 GAAP Net Profit of $5.7 Million, or $0.08 per diluted share - Case Shipments of 50,830 Increase 30 Percent Year Over Year SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007, ended December 31, 2007. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 (Q4 07) were $72.5 million. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 31 percent compared to $55.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 (Q4 06). On a sequential basis, net revenues increased slightly from $71.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 (Q3 07). For fiscal 2007, net revenues of $284.3 million increased 38 percent from $206.4 million reported for fiscal 2006. "Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an outstanding year in which revenue and profitability were well ahead of our original outlook," said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology. "We're entering 2008 with a robust product development pipeline, including Vivera Retainers, Invisalign Teen and Invisalign ClinAssist, which will lay the foundation for long term growth." On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, net profit for Q4 07 was $5.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. This reflects a significant increase from a GAAP net loss of $17.3 million, or $0.27 loss per diluted share in Q4 06, and a decrease in GAAP net profit from $9.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share in Q3 07. GAAP net profit for fiscal 2007 was $35.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $35.0 million, or $0.55 loss per diluted share in fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP net profit for Q4 07 was $9.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share. This reflects a significant increase from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.01 loss per diluted share in Q4 06, and a decrease in non-GAAP net profit from $12.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in Q3 07. Non-GAAP net profit for fiscal 2007 was $45.9 million or $0.64 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $11.7 million or $0.19 loss per diluted share in fiscal 2006.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.

The centerpiece of the new end-to-end approach to clinical education is http://www.AligntechInstitute.com, a dynamic, interactive web site with Invisalign product support, industry news and insights, instructor-led and web-based CE events and more. Business Outlook As announced on January 9, 2008, Align Technology is expected to deliver new products in 2008 with features such as staged delivery with Invisalign ClinAssist and replacement aligners included with Invisalign Teen. These new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price. Therefore, as new products increase as a percentage of total net revenues in the latter part of 2008, deferred revenue on the balance sheet will increase substantially and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. For the first quarter 2008 (Q1 08), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $70.4 million to $73.0 million. Earnings per diluted share for Q1 08 is expected to be in a range of $0.01 to $0.03. Stock-based stock compensation expense for Q1 08 is expected to be approximately $3.7 million.
For fiscal 2008, Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $320.0 million to $330.0 million. This reflects an increase in deferred revenue of $9 million to $18 million primarily associated with new products, which will be recognized in future periods, bringing the Company's total deferred revenue balance at the end of 2008 to a range of $20 million to $30 million. Earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2008 is expected to be in a range of $0.40 to $0.45. Stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately $18.0 million. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and older teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, profit (loss) from operations, net profit (loss), earnings (loss) per share, and operating expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation and the Patients First Program. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance." Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. In addition to the reasons stated above, which are generally applicable to each of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures, we believe it is appropriate to exclude Stock-Based Compensation for the following reasons. Align adopted SFAS 123(R), beginning in its fiscal year 2006. When evaluating the performance of our business, we do not consider stock-based compensation charges. In contrast, we do consider and managers are held accountable for cash-based compensation and such amounts are included in our operating plan. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, Align places a greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants. Forward-Looking Statement This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Align's anticipated financial results and certain business metrics for the first quarter and full year of 2008, including anticipated revenue and deferred revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expense, net profit, earnings per share, percentage of revenue by channel, case shipments and average selling prices and statements regarding the anticipated introduction of Invisalign ClinAssist and Invisalign Teen and the expectation that these new products will increase as a percentage of sales in the later part of 2008. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof.

Santa Clara, Calif. - April 29, 2008 -
Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that its board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million, effective immediately.
 
"We are confident in our ability to generate cash in excess of our needs to grow the business," said Ken Arola, vice president and chief financial officer of Align Technology. "Returning this excess cash to our shareholders through a repurchase program will contribute to our goal of enhancing shareholder value.
It will also have the effect of offsetting dilution from our employee equity plans."
 
Any purchases under Align's stock repurchase program may be made, from time-to-time, in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. The program does not obligate Align to acquire any particular amount of common stock and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time, or from time-to-time without prior notice. As of April 25, Align had approximately 69.6 million shares outstanding.
 
In a separate announcement today, Align also announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter of 2008. For more information, please see Align's press release titled, "Align Technology Announces First Quarter Fiscal
2008 Results."

SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 29, 2008 /  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, ended June 30, 2008.
Total net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 (Q2 08) were a record $79.9 million. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 4.3 percent compared to $76.6 million in the second quarter of 2007 (Q2 07). On a sequential basis, net revenues increased 6.9 percent from $74.8 million in the first quarter of 2008 (Q1 08). Q2 07 shipments included approximately four thousand cases and revenue of $5.2 million from the reduction in backlog and cycle times caused by the allocation of capacity to the Patients First Program during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.
Im pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter despite an ever more challenging economic environment for our doctors and their patients, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology. During the second quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives including todays launch of Invisalign Teen following the successful pilot of the product.
Net profit for Q2 08 was $4.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $13.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in Q2 07, and net profit of $5.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in Q1 08. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q2 08 net profit was $4.8 million, compared to $2.9 million in Q2 07, and $4.0 million in Q1 08.
The Company also announced measures to reduce operating expenses.
 
 
 
Align Technology, Inc. Q2 Fiscal 2008 Earnings Release
 
Prescott said, As consumer spending has continued to soften, so has our outlook for revenue growth. As a result, were reducing overall company spending and slowing headcount growth while preserving the important investments in strategic priorities. Unfortunately, valued employees will be affected, and those are decisions that the management team and I do not take lightly. These actions are only the first steps in actively reducing our cost structure and moving towards a financial model with greater operating leverage.
The cost-saving measures include: a reduction in full time headcount of 38, slowing headcount growth for the remainder of 2008, and cuts in discretionary spending. These actions will reduce expenses in the second half of 2008 by approximately $5 million to $6 million. In addition, the company is implementing a phased consolidation of its order acquisition operations in Santa Clara, California into its existing operations in Juarez, Mexico by the end of 2008. Upon completion, 29 positions in Santa Clara will be eliminated, resulting in annualized cost savings of approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million in 2009. As part of these actions, Align will record a restructuring charge estimated to be approximately $2.6 million in the second half of fiscal 2008, of which approximately $2.2 million will be realized in Q3 08. At the end of Q2 08, Align had a regular employee base of approximately 1,400 worldwide.

Align Technology, Inc. Q2 Fiscal 2008 Earnings Release
About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, net profit (loss), earnings (loss) per share, which excludes the restructuring charge. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On July 31, 2008, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce its overall company spending and slow headcount growth while allowing it to continue critical investments in new products and strategic initiatives, Align Technology, Inc.

As part of the Consolidation, Align notified approximately 29 employees in the order acquisition group located in Santa Clara, California that their positions would be eliminated by the end of 2008.

Align expects to incur approximately $2.6 million in expenses related to retention, severance and other costs associated with the termination of employees. Align expects to incur approximately $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2008 and the remaining $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., October 23, 2008 / -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced a restructuring plan to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the Companys overall cost structure.
The restructuring plan includes a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in Santa Clara, California, of which 46 positions will be eliminated between now and January 2009. The remaining positions will be eliminated over the next few quarters as the Company creates a new shared services organization in its existing Costa Rica operation that will consolidate customer care, accounts receivable, credit and collections, and customer event registration organizations.
Aligns Treat Operations facility has been in Costa Rica since 2002. It consists of a high performance team of 670 skilled clinical technicians and support personnel in a very scalable environment. Treat Operations provides a solid foundation to build a shared services organization that will create greater efficiencies by enabling the Company to leverage the existing infrastructure and the talent base in Costa Rica at a lower overall cost.
This restructuring plan builds on the cost saving actions we announced in July. The majority of what we are doing is structural and many valued employees are affected. These actions, while difficult, are essential to Align becoming a more efficient company and will result in a more robust operating model with room to invest for future growth, said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO.
As part of these actions, Align will record a restructuring charge estimated to be approximately $5 million, of which approximately $3.5 million will be realized in Q4 08 and the remainder over the first half of 2009. This is in addition to the restructuring charge that the Company announced in July 2008. As of September 30, 2008, Align had a regular employee base of approximately 1,400 worldwide.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.
To learn more about Invisalign or to find a certified Invisalign doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com or call 1-800-INVISIBLE.
About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude the effect of charges associated with the restructuring. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

ITEM 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 21, 2008, Align Technology, Inc. (Align) is giving a presentation in Las Vegas, Nevada to financial analysts
in conjunction with its Invisalign Summit for Orthodontic Practices
which is being simultaneously webcast to the public. This presentation includes certain updated revenue guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2008 that was previously issued on October 28, 2008.
Based upon quarter to date results, Align expects case volumes to be at the lower end of the range of its previously issued outlook of 52,500 to 55,000 cases. Combined with the exchange rate impact on European revenues from an increasingly stronger U.S. dollar, Align expects revenue to be at the lower end of the range of its previously issued outlook of $72.5 million to $76.5 million. Aligns outlook for GAAP EPS remains unchanged at $0.01 to $0.03.
Align is not updating or commenting on any other component of its previously provided business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008 or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., December 22, 2008/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that it is terminating the Shelter Agreement with its service provider International Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S. De. R.L. (IMS), based in Juarez, Mexico.  Effective April 1, 2009 Align will become a direct manufacturer and begin producing its custom made clear aligners independently.
"The transition from using manufacturing support services to becoming an independent manufacturer is the natural next step for Align," said Emory Wright, vice president of operations."IMS has been a great partner in helping Align establish a world-class manufacturing process and deliver nearly 40 million individual clear aligners to date.  We will continue to work together over the next few months to ensure a seamless transition.
 
Todays announcement reflects the successful evolution of our manufacturing operations as well as our commitment to improving operating margins, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO.  We continue to make progress on our strategic initiative to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the Companys cost structure.  The expected financial benefit from these actions was included in the three to five year financial model targets communicated at our analyst meeting on November 21.
Align has had its clear aligners manufactured in Juarez, Mexico since 2000 and has 10 employees that manage and oversee the manufacturing process supported by IMS.  IMS currently provides non-managerial personnel, administrative services, and the facilities for Align to manufacture, assemble and produce its clear aligners.  As part of the termination agreement, all IMS employees providing services to Align will be transferred to the Company at no additional cost.  In addition, Align will assume IMSs lease agreement with Elamex for the facility in Juarez, Mexico.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 28, 2009  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 (Q4 08) were $74.1 million compared to $72.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007 (Q4 07) and compared to $75.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2008 (Q3 08).  For fiscal 2008 (FY 08), net revenues of $304.0 million increased 6.9 percent from $284.3 million reported for fiscal 2007 (FY 07).
Despite the challenges of fiscal 2008 we had many significant accomplishments, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology.  We successfully launched three new products including Invisalign Teen, grew annual revenues during the worst business environment in decades, and took action to reduce the Companys cost structure.  As we embark on a new year, the economy remains very difficult and our outlook is more uncertain.  However, the market opportunity and value proposition for Invisalign is strong and we will continue to execute our strategy to drive adoption worldwide.
Net profit for Q4 08 was $65.5 million, or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes a restructuring charge of $4.0 million and a favorable impact of approximately $64.6 million, or $0.97 per diluted share from the release of a tax valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets.  This is compared to net profit of $5.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in Q4 07, and net profit of $5.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in Q3 08.  Stock-based compensation expense included in Q4 08 net profit was $3.9 million compared to $3.4 million in Q4 07, and $4.4 million in Q3 08.
Net profit for fiscal 2008 was $80.0 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, which includes a restructuring charge of $6.2 million and the favorable impact of approximately $64.6 million, or $0.95 per diluted share from the release of a tax valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets in Q4 08. This compares to a net profit of $35.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation expense included in FY 08 net profit was $17.1 million compared to $12.2 million in FY 07.
 
 
 
 
 
Align Technology, Inc. Q4 and 2008 Year End Earnings Release
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share.  For Q4 08 and fiscal 2008, the non-GAAP financial measures excluded the impact of restructuring and the release of the tax valuation allowance from net profit.  For Q3 08, the non-GAAP financial measures excluded the impact of restructuring, and for fiscal 2007, the non-GAAP financial measures excluded the impact of the Patients First Program from net profit. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q4 08 was $4.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $7.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in Q3 08. In Q4 07, there was no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP net profit.  Non-GAAP net profit for fiscal 2008 was $21.5 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $34.0 million or $0.48 per diluted share in fiscal 2007.
Q4 08 Operating Results
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2008, Align had $110.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities compared to $127.9 million as of December 31, 2007.During Q4 08, Align purchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $6.92 per share for a total of $10.7 million.

Business Outlook
Commenting on Aligns business outlook, Kenneth Arola, vice president of finance and CFO said, The economic environment and its impact on consumer spending has created greater uncertainty for our business.  As a result, we are only providing guidance for Q1 09.  The greatest uncertainties beyond Q1 involve case volume and revenues.  We believe it will be very difficult to grow in this environment and are expecting revenues to decline from 2008. We will continue to invest in our key strategic growth initiatives and manage overall expenses to drive operating profitability for fiscal 2009.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2009 (Q1 09), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $65 million to $69 million. Operating margin for Q1 09 is expected to be in a range of -4% to 0%. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q1 09 is expected to be in a range of a loss of $0.04 to breakeven.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q1 09 is expected to be in a range of a loss of $0.03 to a profit of $0.01. Stock-based stock compensation expense for Q1 09 is expected to be approximately $4.2 million.
A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude the effect of charges associated with the restructuringPatients First Program expenses and the related tax effect of those expenses, as well as the release of the tax valuation allowance. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
,
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

Align Technology Asserts ClearCorrect Complaint Is Without Merit SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that the Company has been notified of a purported declaratory judgment action filed against the Company on February 17, 2009 by ClearCorrect, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Align Technology became aware of the filing on February 17, 2009, but has not been served with a copy of the Complaint. In the Complaint, assigned case # H-09-470 and captioned ClearCorrect, Inc., Plaintiff, vs. Align Technology, Inc., Defendant, ClearCorrect alleges that a "controversy exists between Align and ClearCorrect concerning the validity of Align's patents that relate to the manufacture and sale of a clear aligner therapy system" and regarding "the infringement of Align's patents" by ClearCorrect. The Complaint seeks a judgment declaring that unidentified Align patents are invalid and unenforceable and that ClearCorrect does not infringe the unidentified Align patents. Align Technology is not currently involved in any litigation with ClearCorrect, nor has Align previously communicated with ClearCorrect regarding the subject matter of the Complaint or any of Align's 165 issued patents. ClearCorrect's Complaint is entirely unrelated to a previous lawsuit filed by Align Technology against Dr. Willis Pumphrey, ClearCorrect's CEO, for breach of contract, trademark infringement and copyright infringement. That lawsuit was settled to Align's satisfaction in 2007 by the payment of over $330,000 to Align by Dr. Pumphrey and a stipulation by the parties that Dr. Pumphrey was decertified by Align and is no longer authorized to treat patients with Invisalign products. Align has reviewed the allegations contained in the ClearCorrect filing and believes they are without merit. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Complaint.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 23, 2009  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, ended March 31, 2009.
Total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 (Q1 09) were $70.1 million compared to $74.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2008 (Q4 08) and compared to $74.8 million reported in the first quarter of 2008 (Q1 08).  Invisalign case shipments for Q1 09 were 50,060, compared to 52,640 in Q4 08 and compared to 51,770 in Q1 08.
Net profit for Q1 09 was $2.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $65.5 million, or $0.98 per diluted share in Q4 08 and net profit of $5.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in Q1 08.  Q4 08 net profit of $0.98 per diluted share included a favorable impact of approximately $64.6 million, or $0.97 per diluted share from the release of a tax valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q1 09 net profit was $3.7 million compared to $3.9 million in Q4 08 and $4.0 million in Q1 08.
Im pleased that the year is off to a good start with financial results that were better than our outlook, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology. Our first quarter performance reflects higher than expected revenue, case volumes and gross margins, and the benefit of our lower operating expenses.  This combined with a $1.5 million credit for reimbursement of legal costs resulted in earnings that exceeded our guidance.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share.  For Q1 09, the non-GAAP financial measures excluded the impact of the Companys restructuring plan announced previously. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.

Align Technology, Inc. Q1 Fiscal 2009 Earnings Release

Q1 09 Operating Results

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude the effect of charges associated with the restructuringrelease of the tax valuation allowance and the related tax effect. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
,
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

The percentage for Non-GAAP Operating Income should have been noted as 20% and not the 30% indicated in the Form 8-K filed on May 27, 2009.
 
 
e)      On May 20, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan, a cash bonus plan in which the Companys named executive officers participate.  Each named executive officer has an incentive target which is expressed as a percentage of base salary, ranging between 60% and 100%. Target incentive percentages for the Companys named executive officers were not changed compared to 2008 and continue at previously disclosed levels.
 
 Bonus determinations for fiscal 2009 performance will be calculated using the following formula:
 
 
The Individual and Company Multipliers are each derived based on performance and are equally weighted.
 
Individual Multiplier
 
The Individual Multiplier reflects each executives individual performance and is determined at the Compensation Committees discretion based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.   The CEO does not provide input to the Compensation Committee on his own performance.   Individual performance that meets expectations yields a 100% multiplier.
 
Company Multiplier
 
The Company Multiplier is determined based on pre-established goals under selected financial and key company strategic objectives.  For 2009, the corporate financial targets account for 70% of the total Company Multiplier as follows:
 
 
 
 
The remaining 30% of the Company Multiplier is based on the achievement of critical strategic objectives.
 
The Company Multiplier is expected to be the same for all named executive officers.   Maximum achievement of financial and strategic objectives yields a 200% Company Multiplier.  The threshold performance and the level of performance at which the funding for that particular performance measure will be capped as follows:

On June 25, 2009, a jury delivered a verdict against Align Technology, Inc. (Align) in a lawsuit brought by Ormco Corporation (Ormco) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (District Court). Ormco alleged that Align infringed claims of Ormcos 6,616,444 patent. Align claimed non-infringement, invalidity, as well as unenforceability of the patent.
The jury found the claims asserted by Ormco in the 6,616,444 patent to be infringed and valid. The jury also issued an advisory verdict that Ormco did not engage in prosecution laches or unclean hands, equitable defenses that the Court will rule on at a later date. The jury only determined liability; any monetary damages will be determined in a later trial. The verdict does not currently preclude Align from selling its Invisalign System.
Align believes the facts and the law do not support the jurys findings of infringement and validity and will seek to overturn the verdict in post-trial motions with the District Court. If the District Court does not grant Aligns motions, Align intends to vigorously challenge the verdict through an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.

FOR RELEASE ON JULY 23, 2009 AT 1:00 PM PACIFIC TIME
SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 23, 2009  Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2009.
Total net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 (Q2 09) were $76.3 million compared to $70.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2009 (Q1 09) and compared to $79.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2008 (Q2 08).  Invisalign case shipments for Q2 09 were 53.0 thousand, compared to 50.1 thousand in Q1 09 and compared to 54.9 thousand in Q2 08.
Net profit for Q2 09 was $4.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in Q1 09 and net profit of $4.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in Q2 08.  Stock-based compensation expense included in Q2 09 net profit was $4.3 million compared to $3.7 million in Q1 09 and $4.8 million in Q2 08.
Overall, we had a good quarter with better than expected results across the board, including record gross margins and continued profitability, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO of Align Technology. Second quarter revenues increased 9% sequentially to $76.3 million on case shipments of 53.0 thousand, driven by strong international growth and continued uptake of Invisalign Teen.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share.  For Q2 09, the non-GAAP financial measures excluded the impact of the Companys restructuring plan announced previously.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude the effect of charges associated with the restructuringand the related tax effect. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
,
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Settlement Agreement
On August 16, 2009, Align Technology, Inc. (Align) and Ormco Corporation (Ormco) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement), pursuant to which Align has (1) paid Ormco a cash amount equal to approximately $13.15 million, and (2) agreed to issue to Danaher Corporation (Danaher), an affiliate of Ormco  up to 7,586,489 fully paid and nonassessable shares of its Common Stock (the Shares), 5,561,489 of which were issued to Danaher on August 16, 2009 pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into between Align and Danaher on August 16, 2009 (the Stock Purchase Agreement), and subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as amended (the HSR Act), 2,025,000 of which will be issued to Danaher as soon as HSR Act clearance is received and all other conditions are met also pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Second Tranche Shares).  If HSR Act clearance has not been received by September 30, 2009, then from September 30, 2009 to February 28, 2010, Danaher may elect to receive either the Second Tranche Shares or a cash payment in an amount equal to the number of such shares times the average closing price for the 10 trading days preceding such election.  If the Second Tranche Shares have not been issued by February 28, 2010, Danaher will receive the cash payment.
Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ormco and Align will request judgment be entered on the claims resolved by the jury in the litigation involving the parties that is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division, Case No. SACV 03-16 CAS (ANx) (the Litigation), and that all remaining claims in the Litigation be dismissed with prejudice.
 
In addition, the Settlement Agreement includes the following terms:
 
 
 
 
Stock Purchase Agreement
 
On August 16, 2009, Align and Danaher entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement.  The Shares may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.  In addition, Danaher is contractually restricted from selling the Shares to any of Aligns competitors or any activist investor until August 16, 2010.
 
The Shares are also subject to a standstill period commencing on August 16, 2009 and ending on the first to occur of (1) termination of the exclusivity period set forth in the Joint Development, Marketing and Sales Agreement dated as of August 16, 2009 between Align and Ormco (the Joint Development, Marketing and Sales Agreement), (2) February 16, 2011, or (3) a Standstill Termination Event (as defined below), during which time Danaher may not: (i) acquire any voting securities or rights to acquire any voting securities such that Danaher would beneficially own in excess of approximately 11.4% of the outstanding voting securities of Align (the Contemplated Percentage); provided, however, if a party or group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of voting securities which would be required under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) to file a statement on Schedule 13D (a 13D Group) acquires more shares of outstanding Align Common Stock than the Contemplated Percentage, the Contemplated Percentage will be increased to that percentage, but not in excess of 14.9%; (ii) participate in any solicitation of proxies; (iii) subject any Shares to any voting arrangement or agreement with any third party; (iv) make any public announcement of or proposal for extraordinary transaction involving Align; (v) form or join a 13D Group, or other group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities of Align; (vi) otherwise act or seek to control the management, Board of Directors or policies of Align; or (vii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to require Align to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the events described above.
 
A Standstill Termination Event means: (i) Align enters into any agreement with respect to any change in control of Align; (ii) any person or 13D Group shall have become the beneficial owner of 20% or more of any class of securities of Align; (iii) Align redeems any rights under any shareholder rights plan to facilitate any change in control or any acquisition of securities by any person or 13D Group, unless with respect to a modification which would result in a person or 13D Group  becoming the beneficial owner of less than 20% of any class of securities of Align, Align contemporaneously takes such action as may be necessary to permit Danaher to acquire the same beneficial ownership in the aggregate as such person or 13D Group and Align agrees to amend the definition of Contemplated Percentage to permit such acquisition; (iv) a tender or exchange offer is made that if consummated would constitute a change in control of Align; (v) any person or 13D Group publicly announces an intention to commence a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would constitute a change in control of Align; (vi) any person or 13D Group commences a proxy solicitation by which the person or 13D Group would, if successful, elect or acquire the ability to elect a majority of the Board of Directors; or (vii) Align makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commences any proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation law of any jurisdiction or any such petition is filed or any such proceeding is commenced against Align or any of its subsidiaries.
 
In addition, during the Standstill Period, Danaher has agreed to vote all of the Shares then owned by Danaher in favor of all ordinary course, non-extraordinary matters approved by Aligns Board of Directors where such matters are submitted to a vote, action by written consent or other approval of Aligns stockholders, including nominees to the Board of Directors in accordance with recommendations of the Board of Directors, increases in the authorized capital stock of Align and amendments to, or adoptions of, employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans, in each case which are approved by Aligns Board of Directors.
 
Danaher also has a preemptive right to maintain its Contemplated Percentage.  If at any time Align makes any public or nonpublic offering or sale of any securities, other than those issued (i) pursuant to the granting or exercise of stock options or awards under Aligns stock incentive plans approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) in connection with acquisitions by Align to stockholders of acquired companies, or (iii) to banks or similar institutions pursuant to leasing or debt financing transactions, in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships, or to suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services (the New Securities), Danaher has the right to acquire on the same terms up to the amount of New Securities required to enable Danaher to maintain the Contemplated Percentage.
 
In addition, at any time upon Danahers request , Align has agreed to prepare and file a shelf registration statement after August 16, 2010 covering the public resale of all Shares, subject to certain conditions, including Aligns right to postpone such registration as a result of a registration initiated by Align, or if in the good faith judgment of Aligns Board of Directors, the filing of such shelf registration statement would be detrimental to Align. Align has also agreed to allow Danaher to piggyback its Shares on any registration initiated by Align (other than the registration of securities and/or options or other rights in respect thereof solely registered on Form S-4 or Form S-8), subject to Aligns right to cutback the amount of such Shares from the registration under certain conditions.
 
Joint Development, Marketing and Sales Agreement
 
On August 16, 2009, Align and Ormco entered into the Joint Development, Marketing and Sales Agreement, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to an exclusive collaboration over the next seven years to jointly develop and commercialize a unique orthodontic treatment system involving the use of both Aligns Invisalign system and Ormco Insignia brand customized brackets and arch wire system, which system will be capable of treating even the most complex orthodontic cases.  While each party retains its rights to all of its existing intellectual property, each grants a limited license to the other to use its intellectual property in the development and commercialization of the new treatment system.
 
A copy of the Settlement Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to Aligns quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2009.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 17, 2009 -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that it has reached a settlement with Ormco Corporation (Ormco), a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR), to end all pending litigation between the parties and to begin a new strategic collaboration. As part of the settlement, Align will make a cash payment of approximately $13 million to Ormco and issue approximately 7.6 million shares of Aligns Common Stock to Danaher Corporation, Ormcos ultimate parent, that after issuance will be equal to approximately ten percent ownership interest in Align.  Based on the closing price of Aligns Common Stock on Friday, August 14, 2009 the value of the shares is approximately $77 million. The issuance of a portion of the shares is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.For a summary of the terms of the transaction, please refer to the Companys Form 8-K filed today.
 
Align and Ormco have also agreed upon an exclusive collaboration over the next seven years to develop and market an orthodontic product that combines the Invisalign system with Ormcos Insignia orthodontic brackets and arch wires system to treat the most complex cases. Each party will retain ownership of its pre-existing intellectual property, and each party will be granted intellectual property licenses in their respective field for jointly-developed combination products.
We are pleased to resolve this ongoing litigation with Ormco and to begin a new relationship that meets our shared goals of providing innovative products and excellent service to our orthodontic customers, said Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology president and CEO. This collaboration with Ormco, a fellow innovator in digital orthodontics, gives us the ability to compete for a segment of the market that is difficult to treat with Invisalign alone, and accelerates our long-term plan for a combination product.
 
Per the terms of the agreement, Ormco and Align have requested that judgment be entered on the claims resolved by the jury and all remaining claims in the litigation between the two parties be dismissed with prejudice. Additionally, as part of the settlement agreement, Ormco has agreed to release all past claims asserted by Ormco against Align based upon the 444 patent and has agreed not to sue Align for any claim of infringement based upon the 444 patent as a result of  Aligns relating to removable aligners.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 22, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2009.
Total net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 (Q3 09) were $79.3 million compared to $76.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2009 (Q2 09) and compared to $75.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2008 (Q3 08). Invisalign case shipments for Q3 09 were 56.5 thousand, compared to 53.0 thousand in Q2 09 and compared to 52.8 thousand in Q3 08.
Net loss for Q3 09 was $49.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, which includes litigation settlement costs of $69.7 million and royalties of $1.9 million, for a total of $0.85 per diluted share related to the settlement agreement with Ormco Corporation announced on August 17, 2009. This is compared to net profit of $4.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in Q2 09 and net profit of $5.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in Q3 08. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q3 09 was $4.0 million compared to $4.3 million in Q2 09 and $4.4 million in Q3 08.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share.

Commenting on Align's third quarter financial results, Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO said, "I'm pleased to report a very good quarter with better than expected results across the board. Third quarter revenues were driven by sequential growth in the Ortho and GP channels in North America, as well as continued adoption of Invisalign Teen worldwide. Our financial performance highlights the operating leverage possible in our business when we drive sufficient volume into our more productive cost structure, and it reaffirms the tough actions we took over the last twelve months."

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, litigation settlement costs and royalties associated with the settlement with Ormco, the effect of charges associated with restructurings, and the related tax effect. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

EXHIBIT 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 14, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced that it is adding an international distributor for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). As part of the distribution agreement for EMEA, Gil Laks, Align Technology vice president, International will transition from his current position and assume ownership of the distributor, which will have sole distribution rights for the Invisalign system in over 85 countries.
"In the two years since Align established international distributors for Asia Pacific and Latin America, growth has accelerated in those regions," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "The addition of a distributor for EMEA will give us a complete footprint around the world so that our partners can help develop smaller, emerging markets while Align continues its focus on larger, established markets."
Prescott continued, "This is a very exciting time for Invisalign worldwide, and I'm pleased to have a new distribution partner in the emerging growth region of EMEA under the leadership of Gil Laks. Gil is a valuable member of Align's management team and has made tremendous contributions to building our European and Japanese operations and furthering international expansion. I look forward to our continued partnership with Gil, and to working together to extend the benefits of Invisalign to new regions."
Mr. Laks joined Align in 2001 and was promoted to vice president, International in 2005. Under his leadership, Align's business outside of North America grew substantially to represent 22 percent of worldwide sales. Over the last year, Align has continued to build its international leadership team with the addition of two seasoned professionals, Michael Lewis, vice president and managing director of Europe and Michael Chang Wenderoth, managing director of China. Mr. Lewis is responsible for all European operations and brings 15 years of senior management experience in sales and marketing from companies such as Sybron Dental, Becton Dickinson, and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Lewis was most recently president of the EMEA region for Gambro, a global medical technology company. Mr. Wenderoth re-joins Align after spending the past four years as a consultant in China helping companies navigate the Chinese market and develop new businesses. During his previous tenure at Align, Mr. Wenderoth served in various market ing management roles in North America and in Europe. Prior to Align, Mr. Wenderoth spent nearly a decade working in China. His industry and local market experience combined with his extensive knowledge of the Invisalign system will be invaluable as Align continues to develop the Chinese market.
Mr. Laks will continue as vice president, International through the first quarter of 2010 to ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities. Align has initiated a search for a new vice president of International and has retained a leading international executive search firm to assist in the process.
About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

          Record Q4  Invisalign case shipments of 61.1 thousand increase 8.0% sequentially and 16.0% year-over-year           Record Q4 net revenues of $86.6 million increase 9.3% sequentially and 16.9% year-over-year
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 27, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 (Q4 09) were a record $86.6 million compared to $79.3 million reported in the third quarter of 2009 (Q3 09) and compared to $74.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2008 (Q4 08). For fiscal 2009 (FY 09), net revenues of $312.3 million increased 2.7 percent from $304.0 million reported for fiscal 2008 (FY 08).
Invisalign case shipments for Q4 09 were a record 61.1 thousand, compared to 56.5 thousand in Q3 09 and compared to 52.6 thousand in Q4 08. For fiscal 2009, case shipments of 220.6 thousand increased four percent from 212.1 thousand reported for fiscal 2008.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a better than expected year for Align and Im very pleased to report sequential and year over year growth for Invisalign, said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO. Our Q4 results reflect strong international growth, increased demand across the GP and Ortho channel in North America, continued adoption of new products including Invisalign Teen and Assist, and diligent expense management. 
Net profit for Q4 09 was $11.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Q4 net profit includes a benefit of $1.1 million to net revenues, or approximately $0.01 per share after taxes, reflecting an updated estimate for the fair value of Invisalign Teen replacement aligners. This is compared to net loss of $49.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in Q3 09 and net profit of $65.5 million, or $0.98 per diluted share in Q4 08. Q3 09 net loss of $49.9 million includes litigation settlement costs of $69.7 million and royalties of $1.9 million, for a total of $0.85 per diluted share related to the settlement agreement with Ormco Corporation. Q4 08 net profit of $65.5 million includes a restructuring charge of $4.0 million and a favorable impact of approximately $64.6 million, or $0.97 per diluted share from the release of a tax valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q4 09 was $3.1million compared to $4.0 million in Q3 09 and $3.9 million in Q4 08.&# xA0;
Net loss for fiscal 2009 was $31.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, which includes litigation settlement costs of $69.7 million and royalties of $6.2 million, for a total of $0.85 per diluted share related to the settlement agreement with Ormco Corporation, and a restructuring charge of $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. This compares to a net profit of $80.0 million, or $1.18 per diluted share in fiscal 2008, which includes a restructuring charge of $6.2 million and the favorable impact of approximately $64.6 million, or $0.95 per diluted share from the release of a tax valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets in Q4 08. Stock-based compensation expense included in FY 09 net profit was $15.1 million compared to $17.1 million in FY 08.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.

Key Business Metrics
The following table highlights business metrics for Aligns fourth quarter of 2009. Additional historical information is available on the Companys website at http://investor.aligntech.com.
 
 
2009 Business Highlights
During 2009, Align continued to make progress with strategic initiatives including the ongoing evolution of Invisalign products, customer channels, brand strategy and international expansion. The following business highlights summarize the companys accomplishments related to these initiatives during the year:
Invisalign Innovation  New and Improved Features Are Tackling Barriers to Utilization
One of Aligns key strategies for increasing adoption is to accelerate product and technology innovation to extend the clinical effectiveness of the Invisalign system. In October, the Company demonstrated significant progress on this front by introducing new and enhanced features for all Invisalign products. The new and improved features are designed to deliver better results across more clinical situations, and to overcome barriers to utilization by addressing clinical issues that doctors have traditionally perceived as challenging in Invisalign treatment, such as extrusions and rotations.
Proficiency Requirements  Committed to Helping Practices be Successful with Invisalign
In June, Align announced the Invisalign Proficiency Requirements, designed to ensure that every practice that works with Invisalign is successful and every patient that receives Invisalign treatment gets the outcome they wanted. The Proficiency program requires every Invisalign provider in North America start at least 10 Invisalign patients in treatment and complete at least 10 Invisalign-specific continuing education (CE) credits each calendar year to maintain active account status. As of January 2010, approximately 6,400 doctors met the Invisalign Proficiency Requirements and another 15,800 doctors met the criteria for the additional six-month qualification period by starting at least one Invisalign case and completing at least one hour of Invisalign CE in 2009.
New Invisalign Brand Identity  Reflecting Todays Evolving Invisalign Product Capability
Align recently evolved its brand strategy by updating the Invisalign look and feel, including a new and more modern logo. As part of the re-branding initiative, Align updated its consumer marketing programs, including the Invisalign websites, to direct patients to practices that are committed to being successful with Invisalign. All practices that met the Invisalign Proficiency Requirements for 2009 will receive new marketing materials, including the new Invisalign logo. These practices will be the first customers to be able to utilize the new Invisalign branding for use in their own marketing. In addition to the new branding materials, Preferred Providers will benefit from a new Preferred Provider designation that reflects their annual proficiency commitment.  
New International Distributor  Expanding into Emerging High Potential Countries in EMEA
Earlier this month, Align announced that it is adding an international distributor for the smaller country markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). As part of the distribution agreement for EMEA, Gil Laks, Align Technology vice president, International will leave Align and take on a new role as owner of the new distributor in the second quarter of 2010.

GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q1 10 is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q1 10 is expected to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, litigation settlement costs and royalties associated with the settlement with Ormco, impact of releasing the tax valuation allowance, the effect of charges associated with restructurings, and the related tax effect. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned Business Outlook Summary included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operating performance. Management believes that core operating performance represents Aligns performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-p eriod comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

(d) Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Q1 revenues of $90.1 million increase 4.0% sequentially and 28.5% year-over-year
Q1 Invisalign case shipments of 63.6 thousand increase 4.2% sequentially and 27.1% year-over-year
SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 22, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, ended March 31, 2010.
Total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (Q1 10) were $90.1 million compared to $86.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 (Q4 09) and compared to $70.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2009 (Q1 09). Invisalign case shipments for Q1 10 were a record 63.6 thousand, compared to 61.1 thousand in Q4 09 and compared to 50.1 thousand in Q1 09.
Gross margin for Q1 10 was a record 77.4%, compared to 73.7% in Q4 09 and 75.2% in Q1 09. The increase in Q1 gross margin primarily reflects the manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher case volumes. These efficiencies were somewhat offset by $630 thousand of continuing education (CE) training costs that have been re-classified from sales and marketing expense. Historically, with the exception of initial training classes (CE1), continuing education fees and costs for educational programs were charged to sales and marketing expense. As a result of the Proficiency Program annual CE requirement, all training and education fees and costs, in which CE credit is provided, will now be charged to revenue and costs of sales, respectively.
Net profit for Q1 10 was $14.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $11.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in Q4 09 and net profit of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in Q1 09. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q1 10 was $3.5 million compared to $3.1 million in Q4 09 and $3.7 million in Q1 09.
"I'm pleased to report strong results for our first quarter," said Thomas M. Prescott, president and CEO. "Record revenues and case shipments combined with lower spending resulted in better than anticipated earnings."
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q1 10 was $15.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $12.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in Q4 09 and non-GAAP net profit of $3.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in Q1 09.
Q1 10 Operating Results
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2010, Align had $205.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities compared to $186.5 million as of December 31, 2009.
Key Business Metrics
The following table highlights business metrics for Align's first quarter of 2010. Additional historical information is available on the Company's website at http://investor.aligntech.com.  
Q2 Fiscal 2010 Business Outlook
For the second quarter of fiscal 2010 (Q2 10), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $88.0 million to $91.0 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q2 10 is expected to be in a range of $0.12 to $0.14. Stock-based compensation expense for Q2 10 is expected to be approximately $4.4 million. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.
Commenting on Align's business outlook for the second quarter of 2010, Kenneth Arola, vice president and CFO made the following statement:
There are several factors that contribute to our outlook:
With the change we have made to the Proficiency Program, it is uncertain how doctors, particularly lower volume doctors, will respond. It is likely that some practices that have been working hard to accelerate adoption will want to take a breather, while others who started to get that acceleration and enjoying the progress they made may want to continue at their new pace.  
In Q2, we will introduce a consumer rebate program that will run through the end of the quarter, as well as an additional volume rebate for the Elite and Premier providers. This is expected to have some negative impact on ASPs and gross margin during the quarter.  
For our International business, Q2 is historically a seasonally stronger sequential quarter and we expect it to be the same again this year. We do business in Euros and therefore major changes quarter-to-quarter in foreign exchange rates can impact top-line revenues and gross margin.  
June marks the beginning of the summer and we are looking forward to participating in another full season of teen orthodontic case starts and continue gaining share of chair  both at the tail end of Q2 and into Q3.
Other Announcements
In a separate announcement today Align also announced a significant change to the Invisalign proficiency program launched in June 2009 by eliminating the annual case start requirement in order for doctors to maintain their active Invisalign provider status. Doctors are still required to complete a minimum of ten Invisalign continuing education (CE) hours per year. For more information, please see Align's press release titled, "Align Technology Eliminates Annual Case Requirement for Invisalign Providers."

(viii) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 23(c) of the Plan) including, without limitation, the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Awards longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrator may not modify or amend an Option or SAR to reduce the exercise price of such Option or SAR after it has been granted (except for adjustments made pursuant to Section 18) nor may the Administrator cancel any outstanding Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR with a lower exercise price, unless, in either case, such action is approved by the Company's stockholders;

Effect of Administrator's Decision

Eligibility
6. . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, an Option may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.
Stock Options
(a) .
Limitations
(i) Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
(ii) The following limitations will apply to grants of Options:
(1) No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
(2) In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options or SARs to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares, which will not count against the limit set forth in Section 6(a)(ii)(1) above.
(3) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 18.
(4) If an Option or SAR is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 18), the cancelled Option or SAR, as applicable, will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and the grant of a new Option or SAR, as applicable.
(b) . The term of each Option will be seven (7) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

a) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
b) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph a) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(iii) . Each Option grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the Option, the acceptable forms of consideration for exercise (which may include any form of consideration permitted by Section 6(c)(iv), the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
Option Agreement
(iv) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form(s) of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 18 of the Plan.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's termination as a result of the Participant's death, Disability or Misconduct, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
 
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan.

Vesting Criteria and Other Terms
(c) . Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout as determined by the Administrator.

Earning Restricted Stock Units
(d) . Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth in the Award Agreement or as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or as required by Applicable Laws.

Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine; provided, however, that Awards of Performance Units/Shares (other than any Awards granted to Outside Directors) will vest no earlier than one-third (1/3) of the total number of units or Shares subject to such Award each year from the date of grant, unless the Administrator determines that the Award is to vest upon the achievement of a performance objective, provided the period for measuring performance will be at least twelve months.

After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share upon or in connection with a Change in Control or upon or in connection with a Participant's termination of service, including, without limitation, due to death or Disability.

The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).

General
 
control over any contrary provision in the Plan; provided, however, that the Administrator may in its discretion grant Awards that are not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code to such Participants that are based on Performance Goals or other specific criteria or goals but that do not satisfy the requirements of this Section 12.
(b) . The granting and/or vesting of Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units and other incentives under the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business criteria within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement ("Performance Goals") including cash flow; cash position; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings per Share; economic profit; economic value added; equity or stockholder's equity; market share; net income; net profit; net sales; operating earnings; operating income; profit before tax; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; ratio of operating earnings to capital spending; return on net assets; revenue; sales growth; Share price; or total return to stockholders. Any Performance Goals may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or a business unit or other segment of the Company, or one or more product lines or specific markets and may be measured on a growth basis or relative basis to a peer group or index. The Performance Goals for a Participant will be determined by the Administrator based on the Company's tactical and strategic business objectives, which may differ from Participant to Participant and from Award to Award. Prior to the Determination Date, the Administrator will determine whether to make any adjustments to the calculation of any Performance Goal with respect to any Participant for any significant or extraordinary events affecting the Company. In all other respects, Performance Goals will be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology established by the Administrator prior to the issuance of an Award, which is consistently applied and identified in the financial statements, including footnotes, or the management discussion and analysis section of the Company's annual report.
Performance Goals

To the extent necessary to comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to any Award granted subject to Performance Goals and intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, on or before the Determination Date (i.e., within the first twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period, but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the commencement of any Performance Period or such other time as may be required or permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code), the Administrator will, in writing, (i) designate one or more Participants to whom an Award will be made, (ii) select the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Period, (iii) establish the Performance Goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (iv) specify the relationship between Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant for such Performance Period.
Procedures
(d) . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award which is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
Additional Limitations
(e) . Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved. In determining the amounts earned by a Participant pursuant to an Award intended to qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will have the right to (a) reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the

A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.
13. . Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral of Awards will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. The Plan and each Award Agreement under the Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.

For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first (1
Leaves of Absence/Transfer Between Locations
st

15. . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards
16. . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider due to his or her Misconduct or should a Participant engage in Misconduct while holding an outstanding Award, then all Awards that the Participant then holds will immediately terminate and the Participant will have no further rights with respect to such Awards. Upon such a termination, the Shares covered by the Awards that so terminate will revert to the Plan.

Adjustments
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.

Change in Control
With respect to Awards granted to Outside Directors that are assumed or substituted for, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares subject thereto, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met.
For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of
 
an Award settled in cash, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Award by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance objectives (including any Performance Goals) will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance objectives without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance objectives only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, if a payment under an Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement or other agreement related to the Award does not comply with the definition of "change in control" for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A of the Code without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A of the Code.

The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
Withholding Arrangements
20. . Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
No Effect on Employment or Service
21. .

(c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.

The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.

The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may permit all Participants in a specified Offering to contribute amounts to the Plan through payment by cash, check or other means set forth in the subscription agreement prior to each Exercise Date of each Purchase Period, provided that payment through means other than payroll deductions shall be permitted only if the Participant has not already had the maximum permitted amount withheld through payroll deductions during the Purchase Period. A Participant's subscription agreement will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(b) Payroll deductions for a Participant will commence on the first pay day following the Enrollment Date and will end on the last pay day prior to the Exercise Date of such Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.
 
(c) All Contributions made for a Participant will be credited to his or her account under the Plan and payroll deductions will be made in whole percentages only. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account.
(d) A Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10, or may increase or decrease the rate of his or her Contributions during the Offering Period by (i) properly completing and submitting to the Company's stock administration office (or its designee), on or before a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Exercise Date, a new subscription agreement authorizing the change in Contribution rate in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose, or (ii) following an electronic or other procedure prescribed by the Administrator; provided, however, that a Participant may only make one Contribution change during each month of the Offering Period and, provided, further, that unless the Administrator provides otherwise, a Participant may reduce, but not increase, his or her Contribution rate during a Purchase Period for that Purchase Period (it being understood that a Participant may increase his or her Contribution rate for a future Purchase Period prior to the commencement of any such Purchase Period). If a Participant has not followed such procedures to change the rate of Contributions, the rate of his or her Contributions will continue at the originally elected rate throughout the Offering Period and future Offering Periods (unless terminated as provided in Section 10). The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, limit the nature and/or number of Contribution rate changes that may be made by Participants during any Offering Period, and may establish such other conditions or limitations as it deems appropriate for Plan administration. Any change in payroll deduction rate made pursuant to this Section 6(d) will be effective as of the first full payroll period following five (5) business days after the date on which the change is made by the Participant (unless the Administrator, in its sole discretion, elects to process a given change in payroll deduction rate more quickly).
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b), a Participant's Contributions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during a Purchase Period. Subject to Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, Contributions will recommence at the rate originally elected by the Participant effective as of the beginning of the first Purchase Period scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
(f) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Plan, the Administrator may allow Eligible Employees to participate in the Plan via cash contributions instead of payroll deductions if (i) payroll deductions are not permitted under applicable local law, and (ii) the Administrator determines that cash contributions are permissible under Section 423 of the Code.
(g) At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Common Stock issued under the Plan is disposed of (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the Company's or Employer's federal, state, local or any other tax liability payable to any authority including taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside of the U.S., national insurance, social security or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs). At any time, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's Compensation the amount necessary for the Company or the Employer to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or the Employer any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Eligible Employee. In addition, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or any other method of withholding the Company or the Employer deems appropriate to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f).

The Eligible Employee may accept the grant of such option with respect to an Offering Period by electing to participate in the Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 5. The Administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that an Eligible Employee may purchase during each Purchase Period of an Offering Period. Exercise of the option will occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10. The option will expire on the last day of the Offering Period.
9. .
Exercise of Option
(a) Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares of Common Stock will be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated Contributions from his or her account. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be purchased; any Contributions accumulated in a Participant's account, which are not sufficient to purchase a full share will be retained in the Participant's account for the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the Participant as provided in Section 10. Any other funds left over in a Participant's account after the Exercise Date will be returned to the Participant. During a Participant's lifetime, a Participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.

The Company may make a pro rata allocation of the shares available on the Enrollment Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant to the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any authorization of additional shares for issuance under the Plan by the Company's stockholders subsequent to such Enrollment Date.
10. . As soon as reasonably practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company will arrange the delivery to each Participant the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option in a form determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) and pursuant to rules established by the Administrator. The Company may permit or require that shares be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Company or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Company may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer. The Company may require that shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares. No Participant will have any voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to any option granted under the Plan until such shares have been purchased and delivered to the Participant as provided in this Section 9.

All of the Participant's Contributions credited to his or her account will be paid to such Participant promptly after receipt of notice of withdrawal and such Participant's option for the Offering Period will be automatically terminated, and no further Contributions for the purchase of shares will be made for such Offering Period. If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period, unless the Participant re-enrolls in the Plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.
(b) A Participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant withdraws.
12. . Upon a Participant's ceasing to be an Eligible Employee, for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to such Participant's account during the Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan will be returned to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 15, and such Participant's option will be automatically terminated.
Termination of Employment

No interest will accrue on the Contributions of a participant in the Plan, except as may be required by applicable law, as determined by the Company, and if so required by the laws of a particular jurisdiction, shall apply to all Participants in the relevant Offering except to the extent otherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f).

Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Employees eligible to participate in each sub-plan will participate in a separate Offering.

In addition, if permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death prior to exercise of the option. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for such designation to be effective.
(b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by notice in a form determined by the Administrator. In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant's death, the Company will deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
(c) All beneficiary designations will be in such form and manner as the Administrator may designate from time to time. Notwithstanding Sections 15(a) and (b) above, the Company and/or the Administrator may decide not to permit such designations by Participants in non-U.S. jurisdictions to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f).
17. . Neither Contributions credited to a Participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares of Common Stock under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 15 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof.
Transferability
18. . The Company may use all Contributions received or held by it under the Plan for any corporate purpose, and the Company will not be obligated to segregate such Contributions except under Offerings in which applicable local law requires that Contributions to the Plan by Participants be segregated from the Company's general corporate funds and/or deposited with an independent third party for Participants in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Until shares of Common Stock are issued, Participants will only have the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to such shares.
Use of Funds

(b) .

The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically, at least ten (10) business days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participant's option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.
Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.

The New Exercise Date will occur before the date of the Company's proposed merger or Change in Control. The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participant's option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.

If the Offering Periods are terminated prior to expiration, all amounts then credited to Participants accounts that have not been used to purchase shares of Common Stock will be returned to the Participants (without interest thereon, except as otherwise required under local laws, as further set forth in Section 12 hereof) as soon as administratively practicable.

(i) amending the Plan to conform with the safe harbor definition under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto), including with respect to an Offering Period underway at the time;

24. The Plan is exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Administrator determines that an option granted under the Plan may be subject to Code Section 409A or that any provision in the Plan would cause an option under the Plan to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Administrator may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding option granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Administrator determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant's consent, to exempt any outstanding option or future option that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such options to comply with Code Section 409A, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the Administrator would not violate Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the option to purchase Common Stock under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Code Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Administrator with respect thereto.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Q2 Invisalign case shipments of 67.5 thousand increased 6.1% sequentially and 27.3% year-over-year
Q2 revenues of $108.2 million includes the release of $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners
Q2 non-GAAP revenues of $93.9 million, which excludes the release of $14.3 million, increased 4.2% sequentially and 23.0% year-over-year
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 22, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, ended June 30, 2010.
Total net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 (Q2 10) were $108.2 million compared to $90.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2010 (Q1 10) and compared to $76.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2009 (Q2 09). Q2 10 net revenues include the release of $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners. Invisalign case shipments for Q2 10 were 67.5 thousand, compared to 63.6 thousand in Q1 10 and compared to 53.0 thousand in Q2 09.
Net profit for Q2 10 was $32.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share and includes a pre-tax benefit of $14.3 million to net revenues from the release of previously deferred revenue related to Invisalign Teen replacement aligners, and a pre-tax credit of $8.7 million to operating expenses for an insurance settlement related to the OrthoClear litigation. This is compared to net profit of $14.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in Q1 10 and net profit of $4.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in Q2 09. Stock-based compensation expense included in Q2 10 was $4.3 million compared to $3.5 million in Q1 10 and compared to $4.3 million in Q2 09.
"Q2 was an outstanding quarter for Align," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "Our Invisalign business continues to outperform our expectations, resulting in our third consecutive quarter for record revenues and case shipments  even without the positive effects from the release of $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen, and a credit of $8.7 million from an insurance settlement related to the OrthoClear litigation."
In Q2 10, Align released $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners. Invisalign Teen, which was launched July 29, 2008, includes up to six replacement aligners, which may be ordered at any time throughout treatment. Revenue for these replacement aligners was deferred based on 100 percent of the fair value of the aligners, or approximately $350 per case, until the case completed, or the replacement aligners were used. Over the past two years, the Company has evaluated the usage experience of the Invisalign Teen replacement aligners and now believes that it has sufficient historical experience to support a deferral for estimated usage of approximately $20 per case.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net revenues for Q2 10 were $93.9 million. Non-GAAP net profit for Q2 10 was $16.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $15.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q1 10 and non-GAAP net profit of $4.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in Q2 09.
Q2 10 Operating Results
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2010, Align had $244.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities compared to $186.5 million as of December 31, 2009.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, royalties associated with the settlement with Ormco, the effect of charges associated with restructurings, the impact of an insurance settlement and the release of previously deferred revenue of Invisalign Teen, and any related tax effects. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We beli eve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.
Forward-Looking Statement

Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof.

These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2010.

Upon the exercise of a SAR settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Plan.  Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares issued pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan.  Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an Award and/or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(c).
Lapsed Awards
 
(d)           .  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

(a)           .
Limitations
 
(i)      Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(ii)     The following limitations will apply to grants of Options:
 
(1)           No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
 
(2)           In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options or SARs to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares, which will not count against the limit set forth in Section 6(a)(ii)(1) above.
 
(3)           The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Companys capitalization as described in Section 18.
 
(4)           If an Option or SAR is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 18), the cancelled Option or SAR, as applicable, will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above.  For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and the grant of a new Option or SAR, as applicable.
 
(b)           .  The term of each Option will be seven (7) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.  Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

(3)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.
 
(ii)     .  At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.

Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 18 of the Plan.

In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination.

(iv)              .

If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participants estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participants death.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan.

(e)           .  Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period.  A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.  In determining the amounts earned by a Participant pursuant to an Award intended to qualified as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will have the right to (a) reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period, (b) determine what actual Award, if any, will be paid in the event of a termination of employment as the result of a Participants death or disability or upon a Change in Control or in the event of a termination of employment following a Change in Control prior to the end of the Performance Period, and (c) determine what actual Award, if any, will be paid in the event of a termination of employment other than as the result of a Participants death or disability prior to a Change of Control and prior to the end of the Performance Period to the extent an actual Award would have otherwise been achieved had the Participant remained employed through the end of the Performance Period.  A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.

13.         .  Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral of Awards will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.  The Plan and each Award Agreement under the Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.  To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Code Section 409A, the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A.

For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first (1) day of such leave, any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.

Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant.  If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards
 
16.         .  If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider due to his or her Misconduct or should a Participant engage in Misconduct while holding an outstanding Award, then all Awards that the Participant then holds will immediately terminate and the Participant will have no further rights with respect to such Awards.  Upon such a termination, the Shares covered by the Awards that so terminate will revert to the Plan.

(b)           .  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.

Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c)           .  In the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award (or portion thereof), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are not assumed or substituted for, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares/Units not assumed or substituted for will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting not assumed or substituted for, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met.  In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
Change in Control
 
-19-
 
 
With respect to Awards granted to Outside Directors that are assumed or substituted for, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution the Participants status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares subject thereto, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met.
 
For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of an Award settled in cash, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Award by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance objectives (including any Performance Goals) will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance objectives without the Participants consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance objectives only to reflect the successor corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, if a payment under an Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement or other agreement related to the Award does not comply with the definition of change in control for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A of the Code without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A of the Code.

The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
Withholding Arrangements
 
20.         .  Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participants relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participants right or the Companys right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
No Effect on Employment or Service

22.         .  Subject to Section 26of the Plan, this Plan as adopted by the Board in its amended and restated form will become effective as of the date of the Companys 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and will continue in effect for a term ending on the ten (10) year anniversary of such meeting, unless terminated earlier under Section 23of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
 
 
23.         .

Stockholder Approval
 
(c)           .  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.  Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrators ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
24.         .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a)           .  Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

Investment Representations
 
25.         .  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
26.         .  The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted.  Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.

(d) Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Q3 revenues of $95.9 million increased 21.0% year-over-year
Q3 Invisalign case shipments of 66.2 thousand increased 17.2% year-over-year
Q3 gross margin of 78.1% increased 3.7% points year-over-year
Q3 net profit of $16.8 million or $0.22 per share
SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, ended September 30, 2010.
Total net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 (Q3 10) were $95.9 million compared to $108.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2010 (Q2 10) and compared to $79.3 million reported in the third quarter of 2009 (Q3 09). Q2 10 net revenues include the release of $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners. Excluding this, Q2 10 non-GAAP revenues were $93.9 million. Invisalign case shipments for Q3 10 were 66.2 thousand, compared to 67.5 thousand in Q2 10 and compared to 56.5 thousand in Q3 09.
Net profit for Q3 10 was $16.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $32.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in Q2 10 and net loss of $49.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in Q3 09. Q3 10 net profit includes pre-tax litigation settlement costs of $3.3 million related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit announced today. Q2 10 net profit includes a pre-tax benefit of $14.3 million to net revenues from the release of previously deferred revenue related to Invisalign Teen replacement aligners, and a pre-tax credit of $8.7 million to operating expenses for an insurance settlement related to the OrthoClear litigation. Q3 09 net loss includes pre-tax litigation settlement costs of $69.7 million, pre-tax royalties of $1.9 million and additional tax benefit of $12.7 million, for a total of $0.85 per diluted share related to the settlement agreement with Ormco Corporation.
"I'm pleased to report another good quarter of financial results for Align with revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS above our outlook," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "Case shipments were within our guidance range, though at the lower end, reflecting growth from North American Orthodontists and International doctors, offset primarily by greater than expected summer seasonality. This softness has persisted into the fall, especially among our North American GP dentists who have reported lower dental visits and reduced demand for premium procedures, which we believe contributed to lower than expected case submissions for Invisalign as well."
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q3 10 was $19.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $16.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in Q2 10 and non-GAAP net profit of $8.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share in Q3 09.
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q3 10 was $4.4 million compared to $4.3 million in Q2 10 and compared to $4.0 million in Q3 09. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q3 10 was $0.4 million, compared to $0.4 million in Q2 10 and $0.4 million in Q3 09. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q3 10 was $4.0 million compared to $3.9 million in Q2, and $3.6 million in Q3 09.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2010, Align had $280.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $186.5 million as of December 31, 2009.

Given Align's recent performance and updated long-term strategy, the Company remains confident about its future and has revised the 3 to 5 year long term financial model as follows:

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, the impact of an litigation settlement from a class action lawsuit, the release of previously deferred revenue of Invisalign Teen royalties associated with the settlement with Ormco, the impact of an insurance settlement, and any related tax effects. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We beli eve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2010.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Q4 net revenues of $92.9 million increased 7.2% year-over-year
Q4 GAAP diluted EPS was $0.13 and Q4 Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.14
Record fiscal 2010 GAAP net revenues of $387.1 million increased 23.9% year-over-year
Record fiscal 2010 non-GAAP net revenues of $372.8 million increased 19.4% year-over-year
Record fiscal 2010 case shipments of 260,800 increased 18.2% year-over-year
SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 26, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 (Q4 10) were $92.9 million compared to $95.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2010 (Q3 10) and compared to $86.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 (Q4 09). For fiscal 2010 (FY 10), record net revenues of $387.1 million increased 23.9 percent from $312.3 million reported for fiscal 2009 (FY 09). Fiscal 2010 net revenues include the release of $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners.
Invisalign case shipments for Q4 10 were 63.5 thousand, compared to 66.2 thousand in Q3 10 and compared to 61.1 thousand in Q4 09. For fiscal 2010, record case shipments of 260.8 thousand increased 18.2 percent from 220.6 thousand reported for fiscal 2009.
"Our fourth quarter results were solid with revenue and case shipments at the high end of our guidance, and despite a soft start in North America, Invisalign case submissions rebounded in the second half of the quarter and this has continued into the first quarter of 2011," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "Fourth quarter EPS was slightly below our outlook primarily due to costs associated with the Cadent relationship we announced recently as well as higher than expected participation in the Advantage Rebate Program."
Gross margin for Q4 10 was 77.2%, compared to 78.1% in Q3 10 and 73.7% in Q4 09. The sequential decrease in gross margin reflects lower case volumes and higher customer rebates, offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international shipments. Q4 10 gross margins were higher than Align's original guidance range of 76.0% to 76.5% because the cost for the Invisalign Ortho Summit and other continuing educational programs were not included in cost of goods sold (COGS) as the Company had expected when it provided Q4 10 guidance. Starting in October 2010, when the Company eliminated the Proficiency Program annual CE requirements, fees and costs incurred for continuing education programs, including the Invisalign Ortho Summit, were included in sales and marketing expense rather than COGS.
Net profit for Q4 10 was $9.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $16.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in Q3 10 and net profit of $11.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in Q4 09. Q4 10 and Q3 10 net profit includes pre-tax litigation settlement costs of $1.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, related to the settlement of the Leiszler class action lawsuit. Q4 09 net profit includes a benefit of $1.1 million to net revenues, or approximately $0.01 per share after taxes, reflecting an updated estimate for the fair value of Invisalign Teen replacement aligners.
Net profit for fiscal 2010 was $74.3 million, or $0.95 per diluted share and includes the following pre-tax items; a benefit of $14.3 million to net revenues from the release of previously deferred revenue related to Invisalign Teen replacement aligners, a credit of $8.7 million to operating expenses for an insurance settlement related to the OrthoClear litigation, litigation settlement costs of $4.5 million related to the settlement of the Leiszler class action lawsuit, and royalties of $0.8 million, for a total of $0.15 per diluted share, net of tax effects. This compares to a net loss of $31.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share in fiscal 2009, which includes the following pre-tax items; litigation settlement costs of $69.7 million and royalties of $6.2 million, related to the settlement agreement with Ormco Corporation, and a restructuring charge of $1.3 million, for a total of $0.86 per diluted share, net of tax effects.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
For fiscal 2010 (FY 10), record non-GAAP net revenues of $372.8 million increased 19.4% from $312.3 million reported for fiscal 2009 (FY 09). Non-GAAP net profit for Q4 10 was $11.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $19.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in Q3 10 and non-GAAP net profit of $12.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in Q4 09. Non-GAAP net profit for fiscal 2010 was $62.3 million or $0.80 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net profit of $29.1 million or $0.41 per diluted share in fiscal 2009.
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q4 10 was $3.9 million compared to $4.4 million in Q3 10 and compared to $3.1 million in Q4 09. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin was $0.4 million in Q4 10, Q3 10 and Q4 09. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q4 10 was $3.5 million compared to $4.0 million in Q3 10, and $2.7 million in Q4 09. Total stock-based compensation expense included in fiscal 2010 was $16.1 million compared to $15.1 million in fiscal 2009. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in FY10 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.5 million in FY 09. Stock-based compensation expense included in FY 10 operating expense was $14.5 million compared to $13.6 million in FY 09.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2010, Align Technology had $312.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $186.5 million as of December 31, 2009.
Key Business Metrics
The following table highlights business metrics for Align Technology's fourth quarter of 2010. Additional historical information is available on the Company's website at http://investor.aligntech.com.
Align Technology continues to make progress with strategic initiatives including technology innovation, consumer demand creation, enhancing the customer experience, and international expansion. The following business highlights summarize the company's accomplishments related to these initiatives:
2010 Business Highlights
In January, Align announced that it added an international distributor for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). In the two years since the Company established international distributors for Asia Pacific and Latin America, growth has accelerated in those regions and the addition of a distributor for EMEA will give the Company a complete footprint around the world so that its partners can help develop smaller, emerging markets while the Company continues its focus on larger, established markets.  
In July, Richard Twomey joined Align as vice president of international to lead the Company's strategic direction and operations for Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Mr. Twomey's experience and knowledge with large medtech businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions give him the foundation on which to continue building the Company's strategy to drive European growth and International expansion. Mr. Twomey was previously in senior management positions within divisions of Johnson & Johnson, having served most recently as president of DePuy, International Ltd., part of the DePuy Orthopaedics, a global leader in the provision of surgical implants for orthopaedic applications, as well as diversified interests in spinal, sports medicine and neurology sectors.  
In August, Align introduced Invisalign G3, the most significant collection of new features and innovations in the Company's history. Invisalign G3 is engineered to deliver even better clinical results, with new aligner and software features that make it easier to use Invisalign with Class II and Class III patients, new SmartForce(TM) features designed for increased predictability of certain tooth movements, and simpler, more intuitive software to streamline treatment planning and review. Invisalign G3 is currently available in North America and will be launched internationally in the second quarter of 2011.  
In September, Align continued to focus on programs that increase awareness and educate prospective teen patients and their parents. Following the success of major sponsored events during the summer such as the Teen Choice awards and Journeyz Backyard BBQ Tour, a nationwide action sports tour, the Company launched a new teen focused commercial. The goal of the "Twins" TV commercial is to raise moms' awareness that there is an alternative to metal braces, and prompts parents and teens to learn more.  
In October, Align announced that it had received regulatory approval from the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to market and sell the Invisalign system as a Class II medical device for the treatment of malocclusion. The Company also received its License of Medical Device Operation Enterprise (Enterprise License) from the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration, which allows the company to distribute Invisalign in China. The Company expects to begin commercial availability of Invisalign in the second half of 2011.  
Most recently, on January 10, 2011, Align announced an agreement to jointly develop software applications that will run on Cadent iTero and iOC scanners for use in Invisalign treatment. As part of the initiative to improve the Invisalign customer experience through innovation, the new applications will optimize case assessment and planning for Invisalign treatment, and bring valuable digital tools chair-side for Invisalign providers who use Cadent scanners. In addition, the Company announced final beta tests with Cadent to validate their systems for use with Invisalign and expects to announce interoperability in the second quarter of 2011.
Q1 Fiscal 2011 Business Outlook
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011 (Q1 11), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $99.0 million to $102.5 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q1 11 is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.

About Align Technology, Inc.
Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, the impacts of litigation settlements, the release of previously deferred revenue of Invisalign Teen, royalties associated with the settlement with Ormco, the impacts of insurance settlements, restructuring and any related tax effects. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We beli eve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

(the "Company") received annual long-term, equity based incentive awards in the form of options, restricted stock units and market-performance based restricted stock units (referred to herein as market stock units or "MSUs") as set forth in the table below. The award of options and restricted stock units were made pursuant to the form of option agreement and restricted stock unit agreement previously filed on the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed August 4, 2005 and November 5, 2007, respectively. The award of market stock units was made under a form of Market Stock Unit Agreement (the "MSU Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 (officer form) and Exhibit 10.2 (CEO form) hereto.
Each MSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of the MSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the MSU Agreement.
Under the MSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of MSUs ("Target Shares"). Depending on the performance of the Company over a three year period beginning on February 18, 2011 (the "Performance Period"), the executive may earn up to 150% of the Target Shares. The actual number of MSUs which will be eligible to vest (the "Calculated Market Stock Units"), will be determined based on a comparison of the performance of the Company relative to the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index calculated on both February 18, 2013 (the "First Vesting Date") and February 18, 2014 (the "Second Vesting Date") with 50% of the MSUs eligible to vest on the First Vesting Date and 50% of the MSUs eligible to vest on the Second Vesting Date.
The performance calculation will be based on the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the average adjusted closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the last sixty market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the average adjusted closing price of the Company's common stock for the last sixty market trading days prior to both the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date respectively (the "Company's Stock Price Performance) as compared to the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the adjusted index value of the NASDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the adjusted index value of the NASDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty market trading days prior to the First Vesting Date or Second Vesting Date respectively (the "NASDAQ Composite Index Performance"). The number of Calculated Market Stock Units will be determined on both the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date based on the Company's Stock Price Performance as compared to the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance as described in the MSU Agreement.
Acceleration in the Event of a Change of Control (executives not including CEO)
In the event of a Change of Control, for the purposes of determining the Calculated Market Stock Units:
 
In addition, on the date of the Change of Control, the executive will vest in that number of Calculated Market Stock Units equal to (i) (A) the number of calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the Performance Period through the date of the Change of Control, (B) divided by 36, multiplied by (ii) the number of Calculated Market Stock Units.
If the Change of Control occurs prior to the First Vesting Date, the Calculated Market Stock Units that do not vest pursuant to the paragraph immediately above will vest in equal installments on each of the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date. If the Change of Control occurs following the First Vesting Date but prior to the Second Vesting Date, the remaining unvested Calculated Market Stock Units will vest on the Second Vesting Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if executive's employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the executive's individual employment agreement with the Company) within twelve months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then 100% of his or her unvested Calculated Market Stock Units will fully vest.
Acceleration not in connection with a Change of Control (executives not including CEO)
In the event an executive's (other than the CEO) employment with the Company terminates without Cause or Good Reason and such termination does not occur on or within twelve months following a Change of Control, the Performance Period shall be deemed to end upon the Participant's employment termination date for purposes of determining the Company's Stock Price Performance and the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance as well as the number of Calculated Market Stock Units. The executive will then vest in that number of Calculated Market Stock Units equal to (i) (A) the number of months that have elapsed from the commencement of the Performance Period through the date of the termination of employment, (B) divided by 36, multiplied by (ii) the number of Calculated Market Stock Units. The remaining unvested Calculated Market Stock Units will be forfeited at no cost to the Company.
Acceleration in the Event of a Change of Control (CEO only)
In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, on the date of a Change of Control, the Chief Executive Officer will vest in 100% of his Calculated Market Stock Units. No acceleration of vesting will occur in the case of a termination not in connection with a Change of Control.
The foregoing description of the terms of the MSU Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of MSU Agreements filed as Exhibit 10.1 (officer form) and Exhibit 10.2 (CEO form) hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
On February 18, 2011, the named executive officers received options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and market stock units (MSUs) as follows:
 
Approval of Annual Executive Incentive Plan
On February 23, 2011, the Annual Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), a cash bonus plan in which the Company's named executive officers participate was approved. Bonus determinations for our executive officers for fiscal 2011 performance will be calculated using the same basic formula used in 2010. Specifically, performance will be calculated using the following formula:
 
The Individual and Company Multipliers are each derived based on performance and are equally weighted. Corporate financial targets continue to account for 70% of the Company Multiplier as follows:
 
 
The remaining 30% of the Company Multiplier is based on the achievement of critical strategic objectives. For a more complete description of the Incentive Plan, please refer to the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on Form DEF 14A filed with the Commission on April 21, 2010.

Participant:
Address:
You (the "Participant") have been granted an award ("Award") of market-performance based Restricted Stock Units ("Market Stock Units"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, this Notice of Grant and the Market Stock Unit Agreement attached hereto as (the "Agreement") as follows:
Exhibit A
 
By accepting this agreement online, you and the Company agree that this Award is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement, each of which are made a part of this document. You further agree to accept, acknowledge and execute this Agreement as a condition to receiving any Market Stock Units under this Award.
Nothing in this Notice of Grant or in the attached Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant) or of Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Participant's service at any time for any reason, with or without cause.
 
 
1. .
Grant
(a) The Company hereby grants to Participant under the Plan an Award of Market Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in the Notice of Grant, this Agreement and the Plan.
(b) The number of Market Stock Units in which the Participant may vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant will depend upon the Company's Stock Price Performance as compared to the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance calculated on both the First Vesting Date and Second Vesting Date with 50% of the Market Stock Units eligible to vest on the First Vesting Date and 50% of the Market Stock Units eligible to vest on the Second Vesting Date. The actual number of Market Stock Units that will vest on each of the First Vesting Date and Second Vesting Date will be determined as follows:
(i) .
Performance Calculation
1. The "Company's Stock Price Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the average adjusted closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the average adjusted closing price of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, the "Company's Stock Price Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the average adjusted closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the per share value of the Company's common stock paid to its stockholders in connection with the Change of Control.
2. The "NASDAQ Composite Index Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the adjusted index value of the NASDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the adjusted index value of the NAQDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date respectively.
3. The Company's Stock Price Performance will be compared against the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance (each expressed as a growth rate percentage) to result in a growth rate (the "Growth Rate Delta") equal to the Company's Stock Price Performance minus the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance. The Growth Rate Delta will be calculated on both the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date.
(ii) .
Market Stock Unit Calculation
1. If the Growth Rate Delta is equal to 0%, the number of Market Stock Units that will be eligible to vest (the "Calculated Market Stock Units") on the applicable vesting date will equal 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units.
2. If the Growth Rate Delta is greater or less than 0%, the number of Market Stock Units that will be Calculated Market Stock Units on the applicable vesting date will equal: (i) 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) 100% plus (B) two times the Growth Rate Delta; provided, however, that in no event will more than 50% of the Maximum Number of Market Stock Units become Calculated Market Stock Units on the applicable vesting date. If the Growth Rate Delta is equal to negative-50%, then the number of Target Market Stock Units that will become Calculated Market Stock Units on such vesting date will equal 0.
(iii) .
Examples (for illustration purposes only)
1. Example #1: If the Growth Rate Delta on the First Vesting Date equaled 20%, then 140% (equal to 100% plus (2 times 20%)) of 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units would be Calculated Market Stock Units and would vest on the First Vesting Date.
2. Example #2: If the Growth Rate Delta on the Second Vesting Date equaled negative-20%, then 60% (equal to 100% plus 2 times negative-20%)) of 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units would be Calculated Market Stock Units and would vest on the Second Vesting Date.
2. . Each Market Stock Unit represents a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date it is granted. Unless and until the Market Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Sections 3, 4 and 5, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Market Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Market Stock Units, such Market Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. Payment of any vested Market Stock Units will be made in whole Shares only and any fractional Shares will be forfeited at the time of payment.

(b) If the Change of Control occurs prior to the First Vesting Date, the Calculated Market Stock Units that do not vest pursuant to Section 4(a) will vest in equal installments on each of the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date, in each case unless vested earlier in accordance with the terms of this Award, Section 18 of the Plan or any employment or other change in control agreement by and between the Company and Participant.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Participant's employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in Participant's individual employment agreement with the Company) within twelve months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then 100% of his or her unvested Calculated Market Stock Units will fully vest, provided the Participant executes and does not revoke a release of claims as provided for in Participant's employment agreement (as a necessary condition to the receipt of severance thereunder).

1. .
Grant
(a) The Company hereby grants to Participant under the Plan an Award of Market Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in the Notice of Grant, this Agreement and the Plan.
(b) The number of Market Stock Units in which the Participant may vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant will depend upon the Company's Stock Price Performance as compared to the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance calculated on both the First Vesting Date and Second Vesting Date with 50% of the Market Stock Units eligible to vest on the First Vesting Date and 50% of the Market Stock Units eligible to vest on the Second Vesting Date. The actual number of Market Stock Units that will vest on each of the First Vesting Date and Second Vesting Date will be determined as follows:
(i) .
Performance Calculation
1. The "Company's Stock Price Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the average adjusted closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the average adjusted closing price of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, the "Company's Stock Price Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the average adjusted closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the per share value of the Company's common stock paid to its stockholders in connection with the Change of Control.
2. The "NASDAQ Composite Index Performance" means the percentage increase or decrease in (i) the adjusted index value of the NASDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the commencement of the Performance Period over (ii) the adjusted index value of the NAQDAQ Composite Index for the last sixty (60) market trading days prior to the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date respectively.
3. The Company's Stock Price Performance will be compared against the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance (each expressed as a growth rate percentage) to result in a growth rate (the "Growth Rate Delta") equal to the Company's Stock Price Performance minus the NASDAQ Composite Index Performance. The Growth Rate Delta will be calculated on both the First Vesting Date and the Second Vesting Date.
(ii) .
Market Stock Unit Calculation
1. If the Growth Rate Delta is equal to 0%, the number of Market Stock Units that will be eligible to vest (the "Calculated Market Stock Units") on the applicable vesting date will equal 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units.
2. If the Growth Rate Delta is greater or less than 0%, the number of Market Stock Units that will be Calculated Market Stock Units on the applicable vesting date will equal: (i) 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) 100% plus (B) two times the Growth Rate Delta; provided, however, that in no event will more than 50% of the Maximum Number of Market Stock Units become Calculated Market Stock Units on the applicable vesting date. If the Growth Rate Delta is equal to negative-50%, then the number of Target Market Stock Units that will become Calculated Market Stock Units on such vesting date will equal 0.
(iii) .
Examples (for illustration purposes only)
1. Example #1: If the Growth Rate Delta on the First Vesting Date equaled 20%, then 140% (equal to 100% plus (2 times 20%)) of 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units would be Calculated Market Stock Units and would vest on the First Vesting Date.
2. Example #2: If the Growth Rate Delta on the Second Vesting Date equaled negative-20%, then 60% (equal to 100% plus 2 times negative-20%)) of 50% of the Target Number of Market Stock Units would be Calculated Market Stock Units and would vest on the Second Vesting Date.
2. . Each Market Stock Unit represents a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date it is granted. Unless and until the Market Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Sections 3, 4 and 5, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Market Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Market Stock Units, such Market Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. Payment of any vested Market Stock Units will be made in whole Shares only and any fractional Shares will be forfeited at the time of payment.

Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
On March 29, 2011, Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire Cadent Holdings, Inc. ("Cadent") through the merger of Cadent with a wholly owned subsidiary of Align, with Cadent continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Align (the "Merger").
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Cadent capital stock outstanding at the completion of the Merger will be converted into a right to receive a cash payment in an amount that will be determined in accordance with the liquidation provisions of Cadent's certificate of incorporation.
All vested and unvested Cadent stock options will be cancelled as of the closing of the Merger without consideration in accordance with the agreements applicable to such options. All warrants to purchase Cadent capital stock, to the extent not exercised prior to the closing of the Merger, will be cancelled as of the closing of the Merger in consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash for each share of Cadent capital stock that may be purchased under such warrant equal to the difference between the per share consideration that such class of Cadent capital stock is entitled to receive in the Merger and the per share exercise price of such warrant.
The total merger consideration that will be used to determine the price per share payable in cash for outstanding Cadent capital stock is an amount equal to $190.0 million (i)  the estimated amount of any unpaid Cadent transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Merger as of the closing of the Merger or expected to be incurred after the closing of the Merger and (ii)  certain amounts that were paid by Align to Cadent prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. The total merger consideration amount described above is also subject to further adjustment, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, either upwards or downwards, based on the extent to which Cadent's aggregate indebtedness, net of cash, is greater or less than zero.

minus
Align will deduct up to approximately $26.5 million of the total merger consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to holders of Cadent capital stock to be held in escrow as security for indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement and for the payment of the expenses of Shareholder Representative Services LLC, which has been appointed as the securityholder representative for purposes of escrow and indemnification matters as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Merger and the Merger Agreement have been approved by the board of directors of each of Align and Cadent, and by the requisite vote of the Cadent stockholders. Completion of the transaction is subject to other customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and a requirement that holders of Cadent capital stock entitled to receive at least 95% of the total merger consideration as described above execute joinders to the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Align and Cadent, covenants regarding the operation of Cadent's business prior to the closing date, and provisions regarding indemnification in favor of Align. The Merger Agreement provides customary termination rights for both Align and Cadent.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Align or Cadent. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure schedule provided by Cadent to Align in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. This confidential disclosure schedule contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Align and Cadent rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Align and Cadent.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements about the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed Merger, and all other statements in this filing other than historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, each of which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the following cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and are based on current expectations and involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A number of the matters discussed herein that are not historical or current facts deal with potential future circumstances and developments, in particular, whether and when the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated. The discussion of such matters is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally, and also may materially differ from actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters. Such risks and uncertainties include: the timing of completion of the Merger, future financial and operating results; satisfaction of the various conditions to the closing of the Merger; and the risks that are described from time to time in Align's reports filed with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2010. This Current Report speaks only as of its date, and we disclaim any duty to update the information herein.

Third-Party Claims.
(a) In the event that any Indemnified Parties become aware of a third party claim (a "") which such Indemnified Parties reasonably believe may result in an indemnification claim pursuant to this , the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Securityholder Representative. Should the Securityholder Representative so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Securityholder Representative will not be liable to the Indemnified Parties for legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof. If the Securityholder Representative assumes such defense, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and, at their own expense, to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Securityholder Representative, separate from the counsel employed by the Securityholder Representative, it being understood that the Securityholder Representative shall control such defense. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined, would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Person in defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. The Company Securityholders shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Parties for any period during which the Securityholder Representative has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Securityholder Representative chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Securityholder Representative's request) the provision to the Securityholder Representative of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making officers, directors, employees and agents of the Indemnified Parties available on a mutually convenient basis to provide information, testimony at depositions, hearings or trials, and such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Securityholder Representative.
Third Party Claim
Article VIII
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party as to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder and such Third Party Claim involves a claim (i) that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could materially adversely affect the Company in any respect, (ii) that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could result in Losses in excess of the amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund available to satisfy such Losses, (iii) relating to, or otherwise in
 
connection with Company Business Intellectual Property, or (iv) involving criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against any Indemnified Party, then in each such case the Indemnifying Party may not elect to retain the defense of such Third Party Claim (or, if such Third Party Claim was previously assumed by the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder Representative shall immediately relinquish control thereof to the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party will be entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Parties for its Losses incurred in such defense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees), such expenditures to be reimbursed promptly after submission of invoices therefor, subject to the limitations set forth in this .
Article VIII
(c) Whether or not the Securityholder Representative shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Securityholder Representative's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Securityholder Representative shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); , , that the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Securityholder Representative may recommend and that by its terms obligates the Company Securityholders to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Parties completely in connection with such Third Party Claim, and which does not otherwise have any adverse effect on any Indemnified Party.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN JOSE, Calif., March 29, 2011 -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Cadent Holdings, Inc.(Cadent), a leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry based in Carlstadt, New Jersey. Cadent strengthens Align's ability to drive adoption of Invisalign by integrating Invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors' practices. The combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intra-oral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging Align's global sales reach, extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and base of over 55 thousand users.
Over the next 5 years, intra-oral scanners will become widely used in dental practices and intra-oral scanning technology will transform the dental industry. According to iData Research, Inc., the growth rate for intra-oral scanners will exceed 20% between 2010 and 2015. The acquisition of Cadent extends Align's strategic leverage by demonstrating the value of applications at chair-side that dramatically simplify and streamline treatment, and make the entire Invisalign procedure easier on the patient and more efficient for the practice. In addition, the use of digital technologies for restorative dentistry such as CAD/CAM or in-office restorations has also been growing rapidly and intra-oral scanning is required to enable this essential part of dental practices. The acquisition of Cadent positions Align as a leader in one of the best growth opportunities in dentistry and medical devices today.
"We are excited about the opportunities for growth that Cadent provides, not only in terms of accelerating adoption of intra-oral scanning among dental professionals but also in creating greater value for existing Invisalign users," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology president and chief executive officer. "Cadent has a strong team of very talented people and a

Align Technology Acquires Cadent, Inc.
 
culture similar to ours with the drive, agility and speed necessary to continue delivering innovative solutions for our customers."
Cadent leads the intra-oral scanning industry in digital optics and powder-less scanning. Their overall technology is at the forefront of the industry trend toward greater use of digital imaging solutions expected to become more widely used in dental practices. Cadent brings complimentary market knowledge and innovative technology in CAD/CAM restorative dentistry to Align, including capabilities in digital records storage and digital impressions for fabrication of crown and bridge, veneers, implants, and other restorative procedures. Like Align, Cadent also has strong expertise in advanced digital modeling, robust software development, and integrated systems.
Cadent has a portfolio of best-in-class products and services for restorative dentistry and orthodontics which include the iTero and iOC intra-oral scanners. Cadent's iTero technology provides dentists with a full range of restorative choices, flexibility to choose labs and fabrication processes, and control in providing the highest standard of care for their patients. Cadent's iOC technology, used primarily by orthodontists, ensures a more accurate first impression, enables high value clinical applications and a significantly better patient experience. Cadent also has a range of leading orthodontic services and products including OrthoCAD iQ, OrthoCAD iCast and OrthoCAD iRecord.
The acquisition of Cadent follows the January 2011 announcement of a joint development agreement between Align and Cadent to co-develop Invisalign software applications that will run on Cadent scanners. The acquisition builds on the development agreement by providing a dedicated digital scanning platform for delivering Invisalign chair-side applications to dental practitioners and extends Align's presence into restorative dentistry. The combination of the two companies' market leading positions and technologies provides a significant opportunity to create growth and to build value for customers and shareholders.
As part of an ongoing program to evaluate interoperability of intra-oral scanning systems for future use with Invisalign treatment, Align is in final beta tests with Cadent's systems and expects to announce interoperability for their scanners in the second quarter of 2011.
 
Align Technology Acquires Cadent, Inc.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Align will pay approximately $190 million in cash in exchange for all shares of Cadent. The acquisition is subject to various standard closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act (HSR), and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2011.
Align anticipates that the acquisition of Cadent, on a GAAP basis, will dilute fiscal 2011 earnings per share and expects non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.75, excluding acquisition related costs, consisting of amortization of acquired intangibles, transaction related costs and employee retention program costs. The Company expects the transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2012, excluding acquisition related costs, consisting of amortization of acquired intangibles and employee retention program costs.

Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the combination strengthening Align's ability to drive adoption, helping to accelerate the use of intra-oral scanning and creating a significant opportunity to create growth and build value, the industry trend of digital imaging solutions becoming more widely used in dental practices, the expectations with regard to announcement of interoperability and the expectations with regard to the expected impact of the acquisition on earnings per share in 2011 and 2012. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks that Align does not successfully combine and integrate the business, operations and products of Cadent with those of Align in a timely and cost efficient manner, risks that the anticipated financial and operating benefits of the transaction are not realized, and risks that the transaction is delayed or ultimately not consummated. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2011. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
About non-GAAP Financial Information
This release contains a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure, which is used as a measure of Align's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of Align's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, any one-time charges for transaction related costs, employee retention program costs, and amortization of acquired intangibles are excluded from the projected earnings per share dilution. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Align will determine the appropriate acquisition related amortization of intangibles after the closing and, accordingly, cannot reasonably estimate the impact on GAAP earnings per share at this time.
We use this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it is useful and provides meaningful supplemental information to assess projected earnings per share dilution excluding the transaction-related expenses. Our management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors both

because (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) it is provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods.

Invisalign case shipments for Q1 11 were a record 71.4 thousand, compared to 63.5 thousand in Q4 10 and compared to 63.6 thousand in Q1 10.
Gross margin for Q1 11 was 78.4%, compared to 77.2% in Q4 10 and 77.4% in Q1 10. The sequential increase in gross margin primarily reflects higher case volume.
Net profit for Q1 11 was $15.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $9.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share in Q4 10 and net profit of $14.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in Q1 10. Q1 11 net profit includes pre-tax Cadent acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.5 million. Q4 10 net profit includes pre-tax litigation settlement costs of $1.2 million related to the settlement of the Leiszler class action lawsuit and Q1 10 net profit includes pre-tax Ormco royalties of $827 thousand.
"I'm pleased to report strong first quarter results with revenue, case shipments, and EPS above the high end of our guidance," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "The strength we saw in the business toward the end of 2010 continued throughout the first quarter of 2011, particularly for North American Orthodontists. This positive trend reflects increased patient traffic in our customers' offices, along with renewed interest in high-value procedures like Invisalign. In addition, we had good execution in the business and were able to achieve traction from the new Advantage Rebate program and success with practice development programs that help customers build sustainable practice growth."
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q1 11 was $16.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $11.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in Q4 10 and non-GAAP net profit of $15.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q1 10.
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q1 11 was $4.3 million compared to $3.9 million in Q4 10 and compared to $3.5 million in Q1 10.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On April 29, 2011, Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") completed the previously announced acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc. ("Cadent") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") announced by Align on March 29, 2011. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Align acquired Cadent by means of a merger of Cadent with a wholly owned subsidiary of Align, with Cadent continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Align (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of Cadent capital stock, each share of Cadent capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into a right to receive a cash payment determined in accordance with the liquidation provisions of Cadent's certificate of incorporation. All vested and unvested Cadent stock options were cancelled without consideration. All warrants to purchase Cadent capital stock, to the extent not exercised prior to the closing of the Merger, were cancelled in consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash for each share of Cadent capital stock that could have been purchased under such warrant equal to the difference between the per share consideration that such class of Cadent capital stock was entitled to receive in the Merger and the per share exercise price of such warrant. The total merger consideration used to determine the price per share payable in cash for outstanding Cadent capital stock was an amount equal to approximately $177.4 million, which is an amount equal to $190.0 million (i) minus the estimated amount of any unpaid Cadent transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Merger as of the closing of the Merger or expected to be incurred after the closing of the Merger and (ii) minus certain amounts that were paid by Align to Cadent prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. In addition to the adjustments described in (i) and (ii) above, the $190.0 million was also adjusted, on a dollar-for-dollar basis downwards, based on the extent to which Cadent's aggregate indebtedness, net of cash, was greater than zero. Approximately $26.5 million of the total merger consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to holders of Cadent capital stock is being held in escrow as security for indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement and for the payment of the expenses of Shareholder Representative Services LLC, which was appointed as the securityholder representative for purposes of escrow and indemnification matters as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing description of the transactions consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Align's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Any financial statements will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K within seventy-one (71) calendar days from the date that this Current Report on Form 8-K must be filed. Any pro forma financial information will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K within seventy-one (71) calendar days from the date that this Current Report on Form 8-K must be filed.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1
SAN JOSE, Calif., May 2, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of privately-held Cadent Holdings, Inc. (Cadent), a leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry, and makers of the iTero and OrthoCAD iOC scanning systems.
The acquisition of Cadent positions Align as a leader in one of the best growth opportunities in dentistry and medical devices today. Intra-oral scanning is a critical part of enabling new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices including CAD/CAM for restorative dentistry or in-office restorations. Cadent strengthens Align's ability to drive adoption of Invisalign by integrating Invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream chair-side tools and procedures in doctors' practices. The combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intra-oral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging Align's global sales reach, extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities, and base of over 55 thousand ClinCheck software users.
"Align is committed to supporting and building on the technology and products that have made Cadent one of the emerging leaders in intra-oral scanning. That commitment includes continued support of an open system approach that gives doctors and laboratories maximum flexibility, and continued investment in tools that aid and improve restorative, implant, and orthodontic procedures," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align Technology president and chief executive officer. "We will continue to invest in Cadent products and look forward to combining our technology and expertise with Cadent's to deliver innovative new tools to our customers."  
Cadent president and chief executive officer, Timothy Mack, has been appointed senior vice president of business development, reporting directly to Mr. Prescott. Mr. Mack is responsible for creating and developing business partnerships in dentistry and extending Align's technology with distributors and lab partners.
Align plans to maintain all Cadent products and services which includes the iTero digital impression system, OrthoCAD iOC orthodontic digital impression system, OrthoCAD iCast, OrthoCAD iQ, and OrthoCAD iRecord. As part of an ongoing program to evaluate interoperability of intra-oral scanning systems for future use with Invisalign treatment, Align is in final interoperability beta tests with Cadent's intra-oral scanning systems and continues to expect to announce interoperability in the second quarter of 2011.
About Align Technology, Inc.

During the course of the arbitration, the Executive and the Company will each bear equally the arbitrator's fee and any other type of expense or cost of arbitration, unless applicable law requires otherwise, and each shall bear their own respective attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator will not have authority to award attorneys' fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. In such case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys' fees as required or permitted by the applicable statute or contract. If there is a dispute as to whether the Executive or the Company is the prevailing party in the arbitration, the arbitrator will decide this issue.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award that sets forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief authorized by law in connection with the asserted claims or disputes. The arbitrator's award shall be subject to correction, confirmation, or vacation, as provided by applicable law setting forth the standard of judicial review of arbitration awards.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cadent Holdings, Inc. ("the Company") and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficiency and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1d, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for each of the two years ended December 31, 2010 and the stockholders' deficiency as of January 1, 2009 have been restated to reflect an additional tax related liability.

NOTE 1:-  GENERAL (Cont.)
 
On March 29, 2011, Align Technology Inc. entered into a Merger Agreement with the Company. The consideration in respect with the merger was $ 190,000.
 
Following the signature date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company's management became aware of a tax related liability that was not appropriately included in its consolidated financial statements. The Company quantified the total liability in the amount of $2,859 as of December 31, 2010 and $2,781 as of December 31, 2009.
As a result, the Company has restated the December 31, 2010 and 2009 consolidated balance sheets, the accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2009, the statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficiency for each of the two years ended December 31, 2010.
In addition the Company estimated a contingency in the amount of $551 as of December 31, 2010. The Company does not estimate the contingency as probable to occur and therefore no accrual was recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
The schedules that follow reconcile the Company's balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flow from the previously reported consolidated financial statements to the restated consolidated financial statements.
Effect of restatement on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010:

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The significant policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are:
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities and the reporting of amounts for revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
The majority of the revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries are generated in U.S. dollars ("dollar"). In addition, a substantial portion of the costs of the Company and its subsidiaries are incurred in dollars. The Company's management believes that the dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate. Thus, the functional and reporting currency of the Company and all of its subsidiaries is the dollar.
Accordingly, amounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been remeasured in accordance with ASC 830, "Foreign Currency Matters" ("ASC 830") as follows:
Monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured into dollars in accordance with ASC 830. All transaction gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as financial operations or expenses as appropriate.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
Short-term bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than three months but less than one year. The short-term bank deposits are denominated in U.S. dollars and bear interest at an average rate of 0.5% as of December 31, 2009. Short-term bank deposits are presented at their cost including accrued interest.
 
Company management regularly reviews trade receivables and assesses their collectability. Accordingly, the Company records an allowance for trade receivables whose collection is doubtful.

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the average cost method or market value. Inventory write-offs and write-down provisions are provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items or technological obsolescence.
The Company's inventory is mostly comprised of raw materials and finished products. Cost is determined as follows:
Raw materials, parts and supplies - using the average cost method with the addition of allocable indirect manufacturing costs.
Finished products - recorded on the basis of direct manufacturing costs with the addition of allocable indirect manufacturing costs.
The Company writes down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their estimated replacement cost. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required.
Management estimates its reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining its inventories to determine if carrying values exceed net realizable values. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, slow-moving or obsolete inventory amounted to $ 1,029 and $ 1,068, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the cost of scanners sold included the write off of inventory in the total amount of $ 589.
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
 
The Company's and its subsidiaries' long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, "Property, Plant and Equipment" ("ASC 360") whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, no such impairment was identified.
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
The Company generates revenues mainly from selling digital model services (orthodontics CAD/CAM services) and digital impression solutions (scanning technology). The Company sells its scanners and services directly to end-users and distributors, which are considered to be end-users.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605-10, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC 605-10") (formerly Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition"), when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company does not grant a right of return to its customers, and did not have any returns during 2010 and 2009.
The Company's scanners contain a software component. The Company believes that this software element is an incidental part of each scanner. The software element within the Company's products is not sold or marketed separately to customers, and the software does not operate independently of each system. Furthermore, the software development effort does not require a significant cost to the Company relative to the overall development cost of the product. As such, the software the Company provides is incidental to each system as a whole and the software revenue guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification No. 985-605 (formerly: Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2), is not applicable to the Company's revenues.
For an arrangement with multiple deliverables, the Company recognizes revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605-25, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC 605-25") (formerly: Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"). The Company determined that its multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of the following elements that would qualify as separate units of accounting: scanner sales, service contracts, subscription services, extended warranty and significant incremental discount related to the future sales.
Each of these elements represents an individual unit of accounting as the delivered item, the scanner, has value to a customer on a stand-alone basis, objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items, and arrangements generally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item. The Company determines fair value based on the price of the undelivered element when it is sold separately. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 605-25, the Company uses the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when it does not have fair value of the scanner.

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
The Company recognizes service revenues from digital models upon completion of the OrthoCAD Digital Study Models and their delivery to the customers via the Internet, provided that collectability is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Extended warranty and/or subscription revenues included in multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the extended warranty and/or subscription agreement.
In arrangement that provide a right to a discount on a future purchases, which is considered to be more than insignificant and incremental, the Company defers revenues associated with the discount, which are recognized proportionately as the future services are delivered.
Deferred revenue includes unearned amounts received under extended warranty, significant incremental discount and subscription contracts, and are received from customers but not recognized as revenue due to the fact that these transactions did not meet the revenue recognition criteria, or revenues are recognized over the arrangement period.
The Company typically offers a one-year warranty on all of its products. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company's warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
 
The Company presents its Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock (see Note 11) as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity" ("ASC 480"). Accretion of related issuance costs and dividends is recorded as a charge against the accumulated deficit. The Company accretes issuance costs and dividends to the earliest redemption date.
 
In accounting for Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock warrants, the Company applies the provisions of ASC 480. ASC 480 requires freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable to be classified as liabilities. The Company issued warrants which are exercisable into the Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock (see Note 11) in connection with issuance of Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock, long term loans and capital lease arrangements. The warrants have been recorded as a non-current liability and are carried at their fair value at date of issuance with decreases or increases in fair value at each reporting date recorded as other income or expense.

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
The warrants are exercisable either through cash payment of the exercise price or through net-share settlement at the option of the holder.
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718"). ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
The Company recognizes these compensation costs net of a forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation costs for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of four years. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for service options. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected volatility is calculated based on a realized historical stock price volatility of peer companies. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, and is determined based on the simplified method in accordance with SAB No. 110, "Share-Based Payment." The Company uses the simplified method as it has determined that data is not available to develop an estimate of the expected option term based upon historical participant behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. treasury bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends.
Total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options included in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $ 170 and $ 185, respectively. This amount was allocated to each line item in the consolidated statement of operations as required by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, "Share-Based Payment" ("SAB 107").
As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $ 86 and $ 200, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years.
The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost to be recognized in future periods as of December 31, 2010 does not consider the effect of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that may be issued in subsequent periods.

NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company and its subsidiaries to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term deposits, trade receivables and other accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term deposits are deposited in major banks in Israel and the United States. Such deposits in the United States may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company's investments are financially sound and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
The trade receivables of the Company and its subsidiaries are mainly derived from sales to customers in the United States and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, to date has not experienced any material losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to specific debts that the Company and its subsidiaries determined to be doubtful of collection.
 
The Israeli subsidiary's liability for severance pay is calculated pursuant to Israel's Severance Pay Law based on the most recent salary of the employees multiplied by the number of years of employment as of the balance sheet date. Israeli employees are entitled to one month's salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof. The Israeli subsidiary's liability for all of its Israeli employees is fully provided by monthly deposits with severance pay funds insurance policies and by an accrual. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to Israel's Severance Pay Law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the cash surrendered value of these policies, and includes immaterial profits.
Severance expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $ 313 and $ 338, respectively.
 
The Company categorizes the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities according to the hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
 
CADENT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
U.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)
 
NOTE 2:-  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)
 
A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
In circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, the Company is required to use the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities, or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets. If these quoted prices are not available, the Company is required to use another valuation technique, such as an income approach or a market approach.
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
 
 
In addition to the assets and liabilities described above, the Company's financial instruments also include trade receivables, other accounts receivable, trade payables, accrued expenses and other payables. The fair value of these financial instruments was not materially different from their carrying value at December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value under ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" ("ASC 820"), as of December 31, 2010 and as of December 31, 2009 were presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as follows:

Advertising costs are charged as expenses to the statement of operations, as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009 were $ 678 and $ 252, respectively.
 
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for operations taxed as set forth in FASB ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax base of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the base differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
In 2009, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of ASC 740" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with ASC 740. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income tax. As of January 1, 2009, there was no material difference between the provisions of ASC 450, "Contingencies" ("ASC 450") and FIN 48, therefore no adjustment was recorded to the accumulated deficit.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (Amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition)" ("ASU 2009-13"), and ASU No. 2009-14. ASU 2009-13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU 2009-14 removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. As a result of the amendments included in ASU 2009-14, many tangible products and services that rely on software will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2009-14 also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope of software revenue guidance (software deliverables) and deliverables not within the scope of that guidance (non-software deliverables). ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 are to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company believes that the adoption of these amendments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06 which amends ASC Topic 820-10, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures - Overall" ("ASC 820-10"). The update requires a gross presentation of activities within the Level 3 roll-forward and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements. The update further clarifies the existing disclosure requirements in ASC 820-10 regarding: i) the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements; and ii) the disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques. The update was effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010 except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 roll-forward information, which is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. The principal impact from this update will be expanded disclosures regarding the Company's fair value measurements.
 
Accounting Standards Update, "Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements", amended the guidance in FASB ASC 855 to alleviate potential conflicts between FASB ASC 855-10 and the SEC's requirements. ASU 2010 09 clarified that an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. As revised, FASB ASC 855-10-50-1 states that if the entity is not an SEC filer, it should disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated, and whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The Company evaluated all events or transaction that occurred after December 31, 2010 up through March 8, 2011, the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.

NOTE 7:-  CONVERTIBLE LOANS
On October 31, 2008 ("the closing date"), the Company signed a convertible loan agreement ("the 2008 bridge loan agreement") with current shareholders ("the lenders"), according to which the lenders lent the Company an aggregate amount of $ 5,000 ("the principal amount"). The loan bears annual interest of 8% and is subordinate to the Company's existing debt with a financial institution (see Note 8). This loan was converted to Series F Preferred stock of the Company on July 31, 2009.
The loan provides for the following conversion terms:
The holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal under the loan may, at any time after June 30, 2009, elect to convert all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the loan into shares of Series F Convertible Preferred stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $ 4.29. In addition, all amounts due under the bridge financing will convert into the shares of new financing provided that the new financing results in the issuance of equity securities having an aggregate purchase price in excess of $ 5,000 (excluding conversion of the convertible loan).
As part of the October 2008 bridge loan agreement, the Company granted to its lenders a right in the event of liquidation, as defined in the agreement, to receive principal amount of loan multiplied by 2.5 ("liquidation option").
In connection with the 2008 bridge loan agreement, the Company issued the lenders warrants to purchase Series F Preferred stock in an amount which equals the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount equal to the principal amount multiplied by 25% divided by (ii) the price per share, which is defined per the financing agreement.
The Company has applied Accounting Standards Codification No. 470-20, "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" ("ASC 470-20"), in accounting for the convertible debt. The debt was issued with detachable warrants and an embedded derivative, which was bifurcated. The warrants and embedded derivative are classified as liabilities and are subsequently measured at fair value (see Note 2k). The warrants and embedded derivative were initially measured at fair value, with residual proceeds from the transaction allocated to the debt instrument.

NOTE 7:-  CONVERTIBLE LOANS (Cont.)
 
The discount on the debt instrument is amortized and recorded as financial expense throughout the loan period, until June 30, 2009. The beneficial conversion feature amounted at $ 815, was fully amortized in July 2009 with the conversion of convertible loan to Series F Redeemable Preferred stock and is included in financial expenses.
The initial amount allocated to the fair value of the warrants granted during the year 2008 was $ 815. It was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
Such fair value was remeasured at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 for assumptions used for remeasurement.
The liquidation option was accounted for as an embedded derivative in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 815-40, "Derivates and Hedging". The Company allocated a portion of the proceeds in the amount of $125 to the liquidation option's fair value. In July 2009, the Company raised capital, as described in Note 11e, accordingly the liquidation option as of that date in the amount of $ 125 was reclassified from a long-term liability to Redeemable Preferred F stock.

NOTE 8:-  LONG-TERM LOANS, NET OF CURRENT MATURITIES AND CAPITAL LEASES (Cont.)
 
 
On June 5, 2008, the Company signed an agreement with a financial institution, for the provision of a loan facility of $ 13,000. The loan bears interest at a base rate as defined in the agreement plus a margin of 4.25% with a minimum rate of 10.5% and a maximum rate of 12%. The loan does not require any principal payments for 18 months and, beginning in January 2010, the loan is to be repaid in 36 monthly installments with a balloon payment in the 36th month of the remaining principal balance (approximately $ 2,870). The Company and its subsidiaries pledged substantially all of their assets to this financial institution including intellectual property and the Company's accounts, inventory, equipment and deposit accounts. In connection with the loan facility, the Israeli subsidiary signed an absolute and unconditional guarantee in favor of the financial institution
The loan agreement requires the Company to maintain certain levels of EBITDA, minimum cash requirements and restrictions related to capital expenditures and liquidity. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company was in compliance with these requirements.
In connection with the loan and related amendments, the Company granted this financial institution warrants to purchase 277,169 Redeemable Convertible Series F Preferred stock.
The exercise price of the warrants shall be equal to $ 4.29 and the warrant is exercisable for seven years following the closing date.
The warrants for Redeemable Series F stock are recorded as a liability initially recorded at fair value and are remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in financial income (expenses).
The warrants were recorded at their initial fair value and the residual proceeds from the transaction were allocated to the debt instrument.
The resulting discount on the debt is amortized and recorded as financial expense throughout the loan period until January 2013.
The initial amount allocated to the fair value of the warrants granted during 2008 was $ 682. It was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

Such fair value was remeasured at each balance sheet date.
In July 2009, the loan agreement with the financial institution was amended, and as such the Company granted the institution additional warrants to purchase 87,669 Series F Convertible Redeemable Preferred stock with par value $ 0.00001 at a purchase price of $ 4.29 per share. The warrants were classified as liability and therefore they are measured at fair value each reporting period.
The Company accounted for this transaction as modification of the loan in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 470-50, "Debt" (formerly: EITF 96-19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments").
The original and modified debt instruments are not considered substantially different as the difference between the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms and the modified terms is less than 10%. Accordingly, a new effective interest rate was determined at the date of modification that equals the revised cash flows to the carrying amount of the original debt.
The balance of the long-term loan as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $ 11,189, and $ 13,000, respectively.
 
The Company entered into a lease agreement with certain financing companies to acquire certain fixed assets. The Company treats this facility as a capital lease. The balance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $ 666 and $ 1,013, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total acquisition cost of fixed assets under capital lease was $ 1,212.

NOTE 9:-  LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF WARRANTS
 
From time to time and in relation to certain transactions, the Company grants warrants for Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock to holders of Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock, financial institutions and consultants. The warrants are exercisable from the date of a grant and usually granted with expiration of ten years period.
The warrants were recorded at their initial fair value at the date of the grant and were subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in earnings.
Aggregate number of securities called by warrants is 2,195,578.
The Company remeasured at each reporting period the fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

On October 28, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan ("the plan"). The plan provides for the grant of options to purchase Common stock to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has reserved 198,906 shares of Common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the plan. This plan replaced, as part of the Company's reorganization, the Company's 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan for Cadent Ltd. employees and the Company's 2000 Equity Incentive Plan for its U.S. subsidiary's employees. As part of the Company's reorganization in October 2001, 411,164 options and warrants under the plan mentioned above, were issued in exchange for options and warrants of Cadent Ltd.
In August 2003, the Company amended the plan and designated certain options granted under the plan as "Approved 102 Options" such that those options qualify under the capital gains tax treatment in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 to Israel's Income Tax Ordinance. The options generally vest 25% at the end of the first year and 1/48 on a monthly basis thereafter. The options granted expire after 10 years.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following weighted-average assumptions (annual percentages):
 
The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was de minims.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company and the U.S. subsidiary had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 8,000 that can be carried forward and offset against taxable income. Utilization of U.S. net operating losses may be subject to the substantial annual limitation due to the "change in ownership" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.
As of December 31, 2010, the Israeli subsidiary had carryforward operating losses for tax purposes of approximately $ 90,000. The amount of the Israeli subsidiary's carryforward operating losses will be offset against future taxable income for an indefinite period.

NOTE 13:-  INCOME TAXES (Cont.)
 
Taxable income of Israeli companies is subject to tax at the rate of 26% in 2009 and 25% in 2010. In July 2009, the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) passed the Law for Economic Efficiency (Amended Legislation for Implementing the Economic Plan for 2009 and 2010), 2009, which prescribes, among others, an additional gradual reduction in the rates of the Israeli corporate tax and real capital gains tax starting 2011 to the following tax rates: 2011  24%, 2012  23%, 2013  22%, 2014  21%, 2015  20%, 2016 and thereafter  18%.
 
The Israeli subsidiary was granted the status of an "Approved Enterprise" under the Law in respect of two different capital expenditure programs. Income derived from the "Approved Enterprise" is tax-exempt for a period of two years, commencing with the year the subsidiary earns taxable income, and subject to corporate tax at the rate of 10% - 25% (depending on the rate of foreign holdings in the Company), for additional periods of five to eight years.
The period of tax benefits detailed above is subject to a limit of the earlier of 12 years from the commencement of production or 14 years from receiving the approval.
The entitlement to the above benefits is conditional upon the Israeli subsidiary fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the above Law, regulations published thereunder and the applicable letters of approval. In the event of failure to comply with these conditions, the benefits may be canceled and the Israeli subsidiary may be required to refund the amount of the benefits, in whole or in part, including interest.
On April 1, 2005, an amendment to the Investment Law came into effect ("the Amendment") and has significantly changed the provisions of the Investment Law. The Amendment limits the scope of enterprises which may be approved by the Investment Center by setting criteria for the approval of a facility as an "Approved Enterprise", such as provisions generally requiring that at least 25% of the "Approved Enterprise" income will be derived from export. Additionally, the Amendment enacted major changes in the manner in which tax benefits are awarded under the Investment Law so that companies no longer require Investment Center approval in order to qualify for tax benefits.
However, the Investment Law provides that terms and benefits included in any letter of approval already granted will remain subject to the provisions of the law as they were on the date of such approval. Therefore the subsidiary's existing "Approved Enterprise" will generally not be subject to the provisions of the Amendment.
As of December 31, 2010, the abovementioned benefits in respect of two of the programs were cancelled, as the Israeli subsidiary did not fulfill the conditions stipulated under the Law.

NOTE 13:-  INCOME TAXES (Cont.)
 
In December 2010, the Company filed a statement with the tax authority announcing 2009 as the year of election under the Amendment.
According to the Law, the Company is entitled to certain tax benefits, as follows:
:
Alternative track
Under this track, the Company is tax exempt in the first two years of the benefit period and subject to tax at the reduced rate of 10%-25% for a period of five to eight years for the remaining benefit period (dependent on the level of foreign investments).
The income qualifying for tax benefits under the alternative track is the taxable income of a company that has met certain conditions as determined by the Law ("a beneficiary company"), and which is derived from an industrial enterprise or a hotel. The Law specifies the types of qualifying income that is entitled to tax benefits under the alternative track both in respect of an industrial enterprise and of a hotel, whereby income from an industrial enterprise includes, among others, revenues from the production and development of software products and revenues from industrial research and development activities performed for a foreign resident (and approved by the Head of the Administration of Industrial Research and Development).
The benefit period starts at the later of the year elected and the first year the Company earns taxable income provided that 12 years have not passed since the beginning of the year of election. If dividend is distributed out of tax exempt profits, as above, the Company will become liable for tax at the rate applicable to its profits from the approved enterprise in the year in which the income was earned.
Amendments to the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959:
In December 2010, the "Knesset" (Israeli Parliament) passed the Law for Economic Policy for 2011 and 2012 (Amended Legislation), 2011, which prescribes, among others, amendments in the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 ("the Law"). The amendment became effective as of January 1, 2011. According to the amendment, the benefit tracks in the Law were modified and a flat tax rate applies to the Company's entire preferred income. The Company will be able to opt to apply (the waiver is non-recourse) the amendment and from then on it will be subject to the amended tax rates that are: 2011 and 2012  15% (in development area A  10%), 2013 and 2014  12.5% (in development area A  7%) and in 2015 and thereafter  12% (in development area A  6%).
The Company is examining the possible effect of the amendment on the financial statements, if at all, and at this time has not yet decided whether to opt to apply the amendment.

NOTE 13:-  INCOME TAXES (Cont.)
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company and its subsidiaries' deferred tax assets are comprised of operating loss carryforward and other temporary differences. Significant components of the Company and its subsidiaries deferred tax assets are as follows:
 
The Company and its subsidiaries recorded valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforward and other temporary differences, such as vacation, severance pay and research and development expenses.
Management currently believes that since the Company and its subsidiaries have a history of losses, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the loss carryforward and other temporary differences will not be realized in the foreseeable future.
 
As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was insignificant. The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, the Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities in Israel and the United States. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2006 and is no longer subject to Israeli examinations for years prior to 2005.
 

Exhibit 99.2
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 are based on historical statements of Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") and Cadent Holdings, Inc. ("Cadent"), after giving effect of Align's acquisition of Cadent on April 29, 2011 for $187,000,000 in cash, and applying the assumptions, reclassifications and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 is presented as if our acquisition of Cadent had occurred on December 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined statement of operations is presented as if our acquisition of Cadent had occurred on January 1, 2010. These consolidated combined financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements, which are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information.
Align's acquisition of Cadent has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The estimated purchase price has been allocated to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition, and any excess allocated to goodwill.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunctions with Align's historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Align's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and Cadent's historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein for its fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, which are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K/A.

BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
On April 29, 2011, Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") completed the previously announced acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc. ("Cadent") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") announced by Align on March 29, 2011. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Align acquired Cadent by means of a merger of Cadent with a wholly owned subsidiary of Align, with Cadent continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Align. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $187.0 million, which was paid in cash.
The following table summarizes the allocation of the preliminary purchase price as of April 29, 2011 (in thousands):
 
The preliminary allocation is based on estimates, assumptions, valuations and other studies which have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a definitive allocation. Accordingly, the allocation will remain preliminary until Align has all information to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.
Goodwill of $135.5 million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets, and represents the expected synergistic benefits of the transaction and the knowledge and experience of the workforce in place. Under the applicable accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators are present.

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The accompanying unaudited consolidated combined financial statements have been prepared as if the acquisition was completed on December 31, 2010 for the purposes of the balance sheet and January 1, 2010 for the purposes of the statement of operations and reflects the following pro forma adjustments
[A] To record cash paid for the acquisition of Cadent (in thousands):
 
[B] To adjust Cadent's accounts receivable to reflect fair value.
 
[C] To record the difference between the historical amounts of Cadent's property and equipment and preliminary estimated fair values of Cadent's property and equipment acquired and the resulting change in depreciation expense.
[D] Align recorded a deferred tax liability of $9.1 million related to the acquired intangible assets. As a result of the acquisition, $3.9 million of valuation allowance related to Cadent's U.S. deferred tax assets was released due to Align's historical and expected taxable income and the ability to utilize Cadent's deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance related to Cadent's foreign deferred tax assets is maintained due to a lack of historical profitability and uncertain future profitability. Of the $3.9 million of Cadent's deferred tax assets released, $2.6 million relate to U.S. Federal and state net operating losses.
[E] To adjust Cadent's deferred revenue to fair value, representing the legal performance obligations under Cadent's existing contracts.
[F] To record goodwill and the acquired intangible assets for the acquisition of Cadent. See Note 1.
[G] To record the following adjustments to stockholders' equity (in thousands):
 
[H] To reclassify Cadent's training expenses into cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 in order to conform to Align's business policy.
[I] To record amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except for estimated useful lives).
 
[J] To adjust Align's interest income for cash paid for the acquisition of Cadent.
[K] To eliminate Cadent's debt as set forth in the settlement agreement and the related financing costs.
[L] To record the tax provision to reflect the pro forma income tax impact at the appropriate jurisdictional statutory tax rate in which the pro forma adjustments are expected to be recorded. The pro forma combined provision for income taxes does not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had Align and Cadent filed consolidated tax returns during the period presented. The effective tax rate for the combined pro forma is approximately 29.9%.
 
[M] To eliminate the non-refundable funds paid by Align to Cadent in connection with an exclusivity agreement.
[N] To record the direct acquisition costs incurred by Align.

NET PROFIT PER SHARE
The pro forma basic and diluted profit per share amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated statement of operations are based upon the weighted-average number of Align's common shares outstanding.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, Invisalign Teen deferred revenue release, insurance settlement, acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and any related tax effects. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.  
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the third quarter of 2011, including anticipated revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash, as well as the expected timing of interoperability for the iTero digital impression system with Invisalign. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization  in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent, continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2011. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
(1)   Teen deferred revenue release. In the second quarter of 2010, we released $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners.  We excluded this non-recurring benefit as it is not indicative of future operating results. 
(2)   Acquisition costs. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. 
(3)   Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. 
(4)   Insurance Settlement. In June 2010, we received an $8.7 million insurance settlement over a disputed coverage under our general liability umbrella that was not previously reimbursed by our insurer related to litigation with OrthoClear, Inc. We have excluded this non-recurring benefit as it is not indicative of future operating results.
(5)   Tax effect on the above items. This amount adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes using our non-GAAP tax rate to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP adjustments on non-GAAP net profit.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Record Q3 net revenues of $125.9 million increased 4.8% sequentially and 31.2% year-over-year
Record Q3 Invisalign revenue was $114.3 million with record case shipments of 79.4 thousand
Q3 Invisalign Teen volume increased 36.2% sequentially and 54.5% year-over-year
Q3 GAAP diluted EPS was $0.24 and Q3 Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.27
SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 27, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended September 30, 2011.
Total net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (Q3 11) were a record $125.9 million. This is compared to $120.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2011 (Q2 11) and compared to $95.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2010 (Q3 10). Q3 11 Invisalign revenue of $114.3 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 19.1% year over year. Invisalign case shipments of 79.4 thousand increased 4.4% sequentially and 19.8% year over year. Q3 11 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue was $11.6 million, compared to $6.4 million for two months of sales included in Q2 11 following the acquisition of Cadent, Inc.
Commenting on Align's Q3 11 results, Align President and CEO Thomas M. Prescott said, "I'm very pleased to report another good quarter for Align with revenue and EPS higher than our outlook. Better than expected results were driven by increased Invisalign case volume from North American Orthodontists and International doctors, as well as higher earnings that benefited from lower than projected operating expenses. Strong growth of Invisalign Teen reflects our continued penetration in the very important teenage orthodontic market where we believe we gained significant share this quarter. Q3 results also reflect a full quarter of sales from our intra-oral scanner and CAD/CAM services products, which continued to benefit from our sales and marketing resources as we do our best to leverage Invisalign and industry events to introduce iTero and iOC scanners to our customers."
Gross margin for Q3 11 was 73.4%, compared to 75.9% in Q2 11 and 78.1% in Q3 10. Q3 11 gross margin includes amortization of acquired intangible assets related to cost of revenues of $0.3 million, acquisition and integration related costs of $0.2 million, and severance and benefits costs of $0.2 million. Q2 11 gross margin includes amortization of acquired intangible assets related to cost of revenues of $0.2 million and acquisition and integration related costs of $0.1 million. The sequential decrease in Q3 11 gross margin primarily reflects a full quarter of cost of sales from scanner and CAD/CAM services, including costs for Israeli scanner operations that were previously included in operating expense.
Operating expenses for Q3 11 were $66.1 million, compared to $74.5 million in Q2 11 and $53.0 million in Q3 10. Q3 11 operating expenses include acquisition and integration related transaction costs of $1.3 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.9 million and severance and benefit costs of $0.1 million. Q2 11 operating expenses include acquisition and integration related transaction costs of $5.8 million, and amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.6 million. Q3 10 operating expenses includes litigation settlement costs of $3.3 million related to a class action settlement.
Net profit for Q3 11 was $19.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $11.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in Q2 11 and net profit of $16.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in Q3 10. Net profit for Q3 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $1.3 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.2 million with a total tax effect of $0.2 million. Net profit for Q2 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $5.9 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.8 million, with a total tax effect of $1.6 million. Q3 10 net profit includes pre-tax litigation settlement costs of $3.3 million related to a class action settlement with a total tax effect of $0.8 million.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 11 was 73.9%. This is compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 76.1% in Q2 11 and compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 78.1% in Q3 10. Non-GAAP net profit for Q3 11 was $21.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $16.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q2 11 and non-GAAP net profit of $19.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in Q3 10.
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q3 11 and Q2 11 was $5.0 million compared to $4.4 million in Q3 10.

"The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year for Align and we're pleased to have delivered better than expected revenue and earnings, driven by increased Invisalign case volume and lower than projected operating expenses," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "We continue to see solid performance of Invisalign across all customer channels and believe that our continuing focus on Invisalign product evolution and market expansion is at the core of this progress."
Prescott continued, "We had many significant accomplishments in 2011 including the acquisition of Cadent, followed shortly by interoperability with Invisalign on both the iOC and iTero scanners and other significant improvements. For Invisalign, we continued to gain share in the very important Teen Orthodontic segment in existing markets while expanding into new geographies including China, Turkey, the Middle East and Russia. These important milestones will all help us drive continued adoption and utilization of Invisalign and leverage that strong base to become the leader in the intra-oral scanner market."

2011 Business Highlights Fiscal 2011 was another good year for Align Technology and reflects the Company's continued solid execution of its key strategic initiatives including product and clinical innovation, consumer demand creation, enhancing the customer experience, and international growth and expansion. The following business highlights summarize the company's accomplishments related to these initiatives:
In January, Align and Cadent Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry, announced an agreement to jointly develop software applications for the iTero and iOC scanning systems. The new applications will optimize case assessment and planning for Invisalign treatment, and bring valuable digital tools chair-side for Invisalign providers who use Cadent scanners.
In April, Align acquired its joint development partner Cadent Holdings, Inc. for $187 million in cash. The acquisition of Cadent positions Align as a leader in one of the best growth opportunities in dentistry and medical devices. Intra-oral scanning is a critical part of enabling new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices including CAD/CAM for restorative dentistry or in-office restorations.
In May, Align announced interoperability with Invisalign for the iOC scanning system with the latest software version iOC 4.0. Invisalign customers with iOC systems can now submit 3D digital scans in place of physical impressions. In May, Align also announced commercial availability of Invisalign in the People's Republic of China. The company is training orthodontists based in the four major cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, which have a combined population of over 70 million people. Align is offering Invisalign Full, Invisalign Teen and Vivera Retainers directly to Invisalign-trained orthodontists.
In October, Align announced Invisalign G4, the next generation of SmartForce clinical innovations, designed to address some of the most significant treatment challenges doctors encounter. The new and improved SmartForce features in Invisalign G4 are engineered to help doctors achieve even better clinical results for open bite treatments, more predictable movement of upper laterals, and improved root control for canines and central incisors. The expanded Invisalign G4 product features are available on all Invisalign products.
In October, Align announced that it has extended its funding of the Clear Aligner Research Award Program for a third consecutive year for North America universities and a second year for international universities. Launched in 2009, the Clear Aligner Research Award Program is an annually funded program designed to promote clinical and scientific research in clear aligner therapy. For 2012, four one-year awards of $25,000 for North America universities and four one-year awards of $15,000 for international universities will be available, for a total award of $160,000.
In December, Align announced a significant software upgrade for its iTero 3D scanning system used in dental practices for a wide range of restorative dental procedures. The iTero 4.05 software upgrade includes the Invisalign Scanning Protocol for full interoperability with Invisalign treatment, as well as enhancements to software tools that deliver expanded features and greater efficiency in scanning for iTero customers.
In December, Align received a Product Registration Certificate for the Invisalign system from the Federal Service of Health Care and Social Development Control of the Russian Federation. This regulatory approval allows Align to train doctors and to sell Invisalign Full, Invisalign Lite, Invisalign Teen, and Vivera Retainers throughout Russia.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, Teen deferred revenues release, Ormco royalties, acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, severance and benefit costs, insurance settlement, litigation settlement and any related tax effects. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release. 
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the first quarter of 2012, including anticipated revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2011. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
(1)   Teen deferred revenue release. In the second quarter of 2010, we released $14.3 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign Teen replacement aligners. We excluded this non-recurring benefit as it is not indicative of future operating results.
(2)   Ormco Royalties. In the first quarter of 2010, we amortized royalty costs of $0.8 million based on the litigation settlement agreement with Ormco. We excluded this non-recurring benefit as it is not indicative of future operating results.
(3)   Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.                  
(4)   Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.                       
(5)   Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and will be realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and, we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
(6)   Insurance Settlement. In June 2010, we received an $8.7 million insurance settlement over a disputed coverage under our general liability umbrella that was not previously reimbursed by our insurer related to litigation with OrthoClear, Inc. We have excluded this non-recurring benefit as it is not indicative of future operating results.

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except
 
as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
2.6 QUORUM
The holders of 50% of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting, or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
2.7 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the board of directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the DGCL and Section 2.11 of these bylaws, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
2.8 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall be designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the chairperson of the board, if any, the chief executive officer (in the absence of the chairperson of the board) or the president (in the absence of the chairperson of the board and the chief executive officer), or in their absence, any other executive officer of the corporation, shall serve as the chairperson of the stockholder meeting.
 
2.9 VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.
Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, effective as of the first meeting of stockholders at which the directors will be elected following the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes "against" a director's election and shall exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders and (ii) in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.10 STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the Common Stock as dividend or upon liquidation, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.
2.11 RECORD DATES
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the board of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.
 
If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; , that the board of directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 2.11 at the adjourned meeting.
provided, however
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
2.12 PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.
A written proxy may be in the form of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the person.
2.13 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
provided, however,
provided
 
corporation's principal place of business. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
2.14 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3).

3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors shall consist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3 ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until such director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors.
3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the board of directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. If the directors are divided into classes, a person so elected by the directors then in office to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the DGCL.
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board of directors (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the voting stock at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the DGCL as far as applicable.

A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.

prima facie
7.2 NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
(i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and
(ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
 
 
 
 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be evidence of the facts stated therein.

Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
7.4 NOTICE TO PERSON WITH WHOM COMMUNICATION IS UNLAWFUL
Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
7.5 WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 23, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended March 31, 2012.
Total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 (Q1 12) were a $135.1 million. This is compared to $128.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011 (Q4 11) and compared to $104.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2011 (Q1 11). Q1 12 Invisalign clear aligner revenue of $123.3 million increased 3.7% sequentially and 17.6% year-over-year. Invisalign clear aligner case shipments for Q1 12 were 85.3 thousand, compared to 82.6 thousand in Q4 11 and compared to 71.4 thousand in Q1 11. Q1 12 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue was $11.8 million, compared to $10.0 million in Q4 11. The acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc. closed on April 29, 2011, therefore year-over-over year comparisons for Q1 12 do not include scanner and CAD/CAM services.
Commenting on Align's first quarter, Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO said, "I'm pleased to report a very strong quarter and a great start to the year. Strong Invisalign volume, particularly from North American Orthodontists, drove better than expected revenue, margins and EPS, and we achieved a major milestone -- our first $100 million quarter in North America sales. In addition, our scanner and CAD/CAM services business was up nicely this quarter. I'm very proud of our team and the great results they delivered this quarter which reflect their continued focus and execution of our strategic growth initiatives."
Net profit for Q1 12 was $21.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $20.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in Q4 11 and net profit of $15.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q1 11. Net profit for Q1 12 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.7 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.5 million with a total tax effect of $1.2 million. Net profit for Q4 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $1.1 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.3 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.8 million with a total tax effect of $0.7 million. Net profit for Q1 11 includes pre-tax Cadent acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.5 million with a total tax effect of $0.4 million.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q1 12 was $22.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $23.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in Q4 11 and non-GAAP net profit of $16.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in Q1 11. 
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q1 12 was $4.9 million compared to $5.0 in Q4 11 and $4.3 million in Q1 11. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q1 12, Q4 11 and Q1 11 was $0.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q1 12 was $4.4 million compared to $4.5 million in Q4 11 and $3.8 million in Q1 11. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2012, Align Technology had $257.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $248.1 million as of December 31, 2011.

There remains $139.7 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, severance and benefit costs, and any related tax effects, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures, revenues and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release. 
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the first quarter of 2012, including anticipated revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
(1) Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.
(2) Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.
(3) Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and will be realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and, we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
(4) Tax effect on the above items. Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to our annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be re-calculated during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate.
(5) Includes the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
(6) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use EBITDA as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the medical technology industry. We also use adjusted EBITDA which excludes certain special or non-recurring expenses, net of certain special or non-recurring benefits, detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, as an internal measure of business operating performance. We believe such financial measures provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance to our current business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA and similarly titled financial measures in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating or net profit.

Stock Subject to the Plan
(a) . Subject to the provisions of Section 18 of the Plan,
Stock Subject to the Plan
 
the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded and sold under the Plan is 16,283,379 Shares, plus up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 Shares that are or would have been returned to the 2001 Plan as a result of termination of options or repurchase of Shares on or after March 28, 2005. The Shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.
(b) . Any Shares subject to Options or SARs will be counted against the numerical limits of this Section 3 as one Share for every Share subject thereto. Any Shares subject to Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant will be counted against the numerical limits of this Section 3 as one and one-half (1

) Shares.
(c) . If an Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full or, with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units or Performance Shares, is terminated due to failure to vest, the unpurchased Shares (or for Awards other than Options or SARs, the unissued Shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon the exercise of a SAR settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Plan. Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares issued pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an Award and/or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(c).
Lapsed Awards

(iii) to determine the number of Shares to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;
(iv) to approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan;

(viii) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 23(c) of the Plan) including, without limitation, the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Awards longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrator may not modify or amend an Option or SAR to reduce the exercise price of such Option or SAR after it has been granted (except for adjustments made pursuant to Section 18) nor may the Administrator cancel any outstanding Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR with a lower exercise price, unless, in either case, such action is approved by the Company's stockholders;

Stock Options
(a) .
Limitations
(i) Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year
 
(under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
(ii) The following limitations will apply to grants of Options:
(1) No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
(2) In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options or SARs to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares, which will not count against the limit set forth in Section 6(a)(ii)(1) above.
(3) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 18.
(4) If an Option or SAR is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 18), the cancelled Option or SAR, as applicable, will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and the grant of a new Option or SAR, as applicable.
(b) . The term of each Option will be seven (7) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
a) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
b) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph a) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(iii) . Each Option grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the Option, the acceptable forms of consideration for exercise (which may include any form of consideration permitted by Section 6(c)(iv), the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
Option Agreement
(iv) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form(s) of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 18 of the Plan.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's termination as a result of the Participant's death, Disability or Misconduct, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
 
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

In all other respects, Performance Goals will be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology established by the Administrator prior to the issuance of an Award, which is consistently applied and identified in the financial statements, including footnotes, or the management discussion and analysis section of the Company's annual report.
(c) . To the extent necessary to comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to any Award granted subject to Performance Goals and intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, on or before the Determination Date (i.e., within the first twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period, but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the commencement of any Performance Period or such other time as may be required or permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code), the Administrator will, in writing, (i) designate one or more Participants to whom an Award will be made, (ii) select the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Period, (iii) establish the Performance Goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (iv) specify the relationship between Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant for such Performance Period.
Procedures
(d) . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award which is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
Additional Limitations
(e) . Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved. In determining the amounts earned by a Participant pursuant to an Award intended to qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will have the right to (a) reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period, (b) determine what actual Award, if any, will be paid in the event of a termination of employment as the result of a Participant's death or disability or upon a Change in Control or in the event of a termination of employment following a Change in Control prior to the end of the Performance Period, and (c) determine what actual Award, if any, will be paid in the event of a termination of employment other than as the result of a Participant's death or disability prior to a Change of Control and prior to the end of the Performance Period to the extent an actual Award would have otherwise been achieved had the Participant remained employed through the end of the Performance Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.
Determination of Amounts Earned
 
13. . Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral of Awards will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. The Plan and each Award Agreement under the Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Code Section 409A, the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A.
Compliance With Code Section 409A
14. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise and except as required by Applicable Laws, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first (1
Leaves of Absence/Transfer Between Locations
st
) day of such leave, any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
15. . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards
16. . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider due to his or her Misconduct or should a Participant engage in Misconduct while holding an outstanding Award, then all Awards that the Participant then holds will immediately terminate and the Participant will have no further rights with respect to such Awards. Upon such a termination, the Shares covered by the Awards that so terminate will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider due to Misconduct
 
17. . Outside Directors will be entitled to receive all types of Awards under this Plan, including discretionary Awards.
Awards to Outside Directors
18. .
Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control
(a) . In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share and unit limits set forth in Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 17.
Adjustments
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) . In the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award (or portion thereof), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are not assumed or substituted for, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares/Units not assumed or substituted for will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting not assumed or substituted for, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
Change in Control
With respect to Awards granted to Outside Directors that are assumed or substituted for, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares subject thereto, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met.
 
For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of an Award settled in cash, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Award by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance objectives (including any Performance Goals) will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance objectives without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance objectives only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18(c) to the contrary, if a payment under an Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement or other agreement related to the Award does not comply with the definition of "change in control" for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A of the Code without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A of the Code.
19.
Tax Withholding
(a) . Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof).
Withholding Requirements
(b) . The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already-
Withholding Arrangements
 
owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, provided the delivery of such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld or (e) retaining from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant cash having a sufficient value to satisfy the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
20. . Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
No Effect on Employment or Service
21. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
22. . Subject to Section 26 of the Plan, this Plan as adopted by the Board in its amended and restated form will become effective as of the date of the Company's 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and will continue in effect for a term ending on the ten (10) year anniversary of such meeting, unless terminated earlier under Section 23 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
23. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the number of Shares available under the Plan pursuant to Section 3 herein may not be increased without approval of the Company's stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
24. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
25. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
26. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.

EXHIBIT 99.1
SAN JOSE, Calif., May 21, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced that the Company has appointed Tim Mack as senior vice president, marketing and business development, effective immediately. Mr. Mack has served as senior vice president, business development since Align's April 2011 acquisition of Cadent.

Prescott, Align president and CEO. 
"Following a lengthy search, we are pleased to confirm that Tim Mack is the best person to continue leading the marketing organization at Align," said Mr. Prescott. "Tim's strong product and technology background and deep knowledge of digital dentistry and the restorative market are key characteristics that will help Align become the leader in digital dentistry."
Mr. Mack joined Cadent in 2005 as executive vice president and led the introduction and adoption of Cadent's new 3D digital imaging technology into the market. From 2009 until the company's strategic acquisition in December 2011 he served as president and CEO.

This is compared to $135.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2012 (Q1 12) and compared to $120.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2011 (Q2 11).

Q2 11 includes two months of scanner and CAD/CAM services financial results from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc. which closed on April 29, 2011.
"The second quarter was another great one for Align and I'm pleased to report strong results for revenue, operating margin and EPS  all better than our outlook," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "During the quarter strong Invisalign volume grew across all products and customer channels reflecting continued increased Invisalign utilization." Prescott continued, "Our scanner business in North America also grew nicely this quarter and continues to exceed our expectations, while scanner sales in Europe remain challenging and our disappointing results there continue."
Net profit for Q2 12 was $28.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $21.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in Q1 12 and net profit of $11.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in Q2 11. Net profit for Q2 12 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.3 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.2 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $1.5 million.

Net profit for Q2 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $5.9 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.8 million, with a total income tax-related adjustment of $1.6 million.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
Non-GAAP net profit for Q2 12 was $28.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $22.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in Q1 12 and non-GAAP net profit of $16.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q2 11.
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q2 12 was $5.3 million compared to $4.9 million in Q1 12 and $5.0 million in Q2 11. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q2 12, Q1 12 and Q2 11 was $0.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q2 12 was $4.8 million compared to $4.4 million in Q1 12 and $4.5 million in Q2 11. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Q3 Fiscal 2012 Business Outlook
For the third quarter of fiscal 2012 (Q3 12), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $136.8 million to $140.8 million. Invisalign clear aligner case shipments for Q3 12 are expected to be in a range of 94.8 to 96.3 thousand cases, which reflect a year-over-year increase of 19.5% to 21.3%. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q3 12 is expected to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.28. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q3 12 is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.
Commenting on Align's Q3 12 business outlook, Ken Arola, Align CFO said, "Total net revenues for the third quarter of 2012 will be impacted by lower Invisalign ASPs resulting from revenue deferrals associated with the Invisalign Teen/Vivera Retainer promotion, Advantage volume rebates, and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Our Q3 12 outlook for Invisalign case shipment growth of 19.5% to 21.3% year-over-year is an important metric pointing to the continued progress and strength of the business."

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, severance and benefit costs, and any related income tax-related adjustments, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release. 
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the second quarter of 2012, including anticipated net revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
(1) Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.
(2) Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.
(3) Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and will be realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and, we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
(4) Income tax-related adjustments. Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to our annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be re-calculated during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate.
(5) Includes the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
(6) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use EBITDA as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the medical technology industry. We also use adjusted EBITDA which excludes certain special or non-recurring expenses, net of certain special or non-recurring benefits, detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, as an internal measure of business operating performance. We believe such financial measures provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance to our current business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA and similarly titled financial measures in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating or net profit.

Align Technology Announces Preliminary Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
 
SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwire - October 17, 2012) - Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: )
ALGN
 
 
Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) today reported preliminary financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 ended September 30, 2012. The preliminary results are subject to change based upon the conclusion of goodwill impairment testing being undertaken by the Company.
ALGN
 
Total net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 (Q3 12) were $136.5 million. This is compared to $145.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2012 (Q2 12) and compared to $125.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2011 (Q3 11). Q3 12 Invisalign clear aligner revenue was $126.7 million, compared to $133.7 million in Q2 12 and $114.3 million in Q3 11. Q3 12 Invisalign clear aligner case shipments were 92.5 thousand, compared to 95.3 thousand in Q2 12 and 79.4 thousand in Q3 11, and included Align's 2 millionth case milestone. Q3 12 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue was $9.8 million, compared to $11.9 million in Q2 12 and compared to $11.6 million in Q3 11.
 
The discontinuation of Align's distribution relationship with Straumann in Europe and North America, announced in a separate press release today, and the decline in results of operations of the Company's Scanner and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit triggers the risk of impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Cadent. As a result, Align is in the process of conducting step one of a goodwill impairment test as prescribed by GAAP. This test is currently in progress and the Company has not concluded as to whether goodwill, which had a carrying value of $135.3 million as of September 30, 2012, is impaired and for this reason the Company's results are preliminary. Prior to filing its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012, the Company expects to complete the step one impairment test. If the result of the step one analysis indicates an impairment, the Company will conduct a step two evaluation to determine the amount of the non-cash impairment charge, if any. If step two cannot be completed prior to filing of the Form 10-Q for the third quarter, the Company may estimate a range of potential impairment and may record an estimated non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2012 results. Any difference between an estimate and the final step two evaluation, would be recorded in the fourth quarter 2012. The Company's evaluation could result in a non-cash impairment charge for a substantial portion of the $135.3 million book value of goodwill which would negatively affect net income although revenue and cash flow from operations would not be impacted.
 
 
 
 
 
"Despite a strong summer season for Invisalign teenager cases, which increased 21% sequentially and year-over-year, our third quarter revenue was slightly lower than our outlook," said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "Q3 is historically a slower period for North American GP Dentists and International doctors due to summer vacations. This year summer seasonality was more pronounced in North America and as a result, we did not see the expected ramp in Invisalign cases for GP Dentists and Orthodontists. This softness has continued through October and is reflected in our Q4 guidance, which despite that slowdown, still projects a healthy annual growth rate for the company overall, with volume growth of at least 16%."
 
Preliminary net profit for Q3 12 was $24.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $28.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share in Q2 12 and net profit of $19.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in Q3 11. Preliminary net profit for Q3 12 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.2 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.1 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $2.1 million. Net profit for Q2 12 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.3 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.2 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $1.5 million. Net profit for Q3 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $1.5 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.2 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $0.2 million.
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
 
Non-GAAP net profit for Q3 12 was $23.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $28.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share in Q2 12 and non-GAAP net profit of $21.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in Q3 11.
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 Operating Results ($M)
 
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q3 12 was $5.4 million compared to $5.3 million in Q2 12 and $5.0 million in Q3 11. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q3 12, Q2 12 and Q3 11 was $0.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q3 12 was $4.9 million compared to $4.8 million in Q2 12 and $4.5 million in Q3 11.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2012, Align Technology had $348.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $248.1 million as of December 31, 2011. During Q3 12, we purchased approximately 213,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $34.15 per share for a total of approximately $7.3 million. There remains approximately $132.5 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.
 
Q4 Fiscal 2012 Business Outlook
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (Q4 12), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $134.2 million to $137.8 million. Invisalign clear aligner case shipments for Q4 12 are expected to be in a range of 90.0 to 93.0 thousand cases, which reflect a year-over-year increase of 9.0% to 12.6%. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 12 is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23, excluding any potential impairment charge. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 12 is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.

Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the fourth quarter of 2012, including anticipated net revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. In addition to that information, the possibility of an impairment charge, which could result in a substantial reduction against goodwill and a commensurate charge against earnings, could have a material adverse impact on the preliminary results reported in this press release and on results during a subsequent period. While the Company expects to reflect the outcome of its impairment testing in its Form 10-Q and final reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
References to GAAP in the third quarter tables above are preliminary GAAP results and do not include the impact of any potential impairment charge.
 
(1) Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.
 
(2) Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.
 
(3) Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and were realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and, we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
 
(4) Income tax-related adjustments. Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to our annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for discrete tax items and items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be re-calculated during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate.
 
(5) Includes the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
 
(6) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use EBITDA as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the medical technology industry.

(NASDAQ: ) today announced that the Company has reached a mutual agreement with Straumann to terminate their distribution agreements for iTero intra-oral scanners in Europe and North America, effective December 31, 2012. The original exclusive distribution agreement in Europe was signed in December 2009 between Straumann and Cadent Inc., the developer of iTero, which was subsequently acquired by Align in April 2011. A subsequent agreement was operationalized in February 2011, awarding Straumann non-exclusive distribution rights for iTero intra-oral scanners in North America.

For more than a decade, Align Technology has led the digital revolution in orthodontics with the Invisalign system. Since acquiring Cadent 18 months ago, Align has been equally committed to enabling the same type of digital shift within restorative dentistry, with the iTero scanner as the center of that strategy. Align and Straumann have worked together over the past few years to build a sales, services, and support model for the iTero scanner to benefit both companies. Despite collective efforts, the two companies have concluded that their current collaboration for distributing iTero scanners does not meet their strategic or financial requirements in the present economic environment. They will however continue to collaborate on workflows incorporating intra-oral scanning in the future.
 
Align has decided to market iTero on a more limited basis directly in Europe focusing on its existing Invisalign customers. Align will continue its direct sales of iTero scanners in North America where digital dentistry is evolving more rapidly, while pursuing global scanner potential on a more opportunistic basis. Over the past year, Align has invested in its scanner business in North America by doubling the number of direct sales representatives and in-office trainers, through ongoing improvements in scanner service and support, and through a robust product and applications development pipeline.
 
Align and Straumann are committed to ensuring a continued high level of service and support for their existing iTero customers in Europe and North America. Straumann will continue to offer first-level equipment support in Europe for at least the next 12 months, after which full responsibility for regional customer service will transfer to Align. The two companies are currently working together on plans for a smooth transition and will communicate details to customers as soon as they are finalized.

Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.The Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express10, Invisalign Express 5, Invisalign Lite, and Vivera Retainers.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Align Technology Q3 2012 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Shirley Stacy of Align Technology. Ms. Stacey, you may begin.
Shirley Stacy
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP of Corporate and Investor Communications
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Communications. Joining me today is Tom Prescott, President and CEO; and Ken Arola, Vice President and CFO.
We issued preliminary third-quarter financial results via press release today on Marketwire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 12 months. A telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5.30 p.m. Eastern time through 5.30 p.m. Eastern time on October 25. To access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial 877-660-6853 with conference number 400990, followed by pound. International callers should dial 201-612-7415 with the same conference number.
As a reminder, the information that the presenters discuss today will include forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements of that Align's future products, product outlook, and the expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
These forward-looking statements are only predictions, and involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may vary significantly. These and other results are set forth in more detail in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. These forward-looking statements reflect the beliefs, estimates, and predictions as of today; and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
Please also note that on this conference call we will provide listeners with several financial metrics determined on a non-GAAP basis for comparisons to previous quarters. Most of these items, together with the corresponding GAAP numbers -- and the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures where practical -- are contained in today's financial results press release, which we have posted on our website at investor.aligntech.com under Financial Releases; and have been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K.
We encourage listeners to review these items. In addition, the possibility of an impairment charge, which could result in a substantial reduction against goodwill and a commensurate charge against earnings, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's preliminary results. We have posted a set of GAAP and non-GAAP historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliation in our third-quarter conference call slides, on our website at investor.aligntech.com under Quarterly Results.
Please refer to these files for more detailed information.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology President and CEO, Tom Prescott.

- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call today I'll provide an overview of preliminary third-quarter results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner and CAD/CAM Services.
As Shirley discussed, these results are preliminary, based on the outcome of our goodwill impairment analysis which is currently incomplete. Ken will cover the circumstances in his discussion of our preliminary Q3 financial results, as well as outlook for Q4 in more detail.
I'll come back with a few closing comments, and open up the call to questions.
Q3 revenue of $136.5 million increased 8.4% year over year, and yet decreased 6.3% sequentially. Despite a strong summer season for Invisalign teenager cases, which increased 21% sequentially and year over year, our third-quarter revenue was slightly lower than our outlook.
Q3 is historically a slower period for North American GP dentists, who have fewer days in office due to vacations; as well as for international doctors, who typically take extended summer holidays, especially so in southern Europe.
This year, summer seasonality was more pronounced in North America. And as a result, we did not see the expected ramp in Invisalign cases for GPs and orthodontists. This softness has continued through October and is reflected our Q4 guidance; which, despite that slowdown, still projects a healthy annual growth rate for the Company overall, with volume growth of at least 16%.
We're taking a complete look at our results, including demand for our products, and analyzing the industry and the markets in which we operate. We are evaluating a lot of data, much of which is conflicting, and none of which supports a fundamental decrease in demand for Invisalign. On the one hand, data such as the surprisingly strong recent consumer sentiment ratings, as well as the uptick in visitors to invisalign.com in find-a-doctor searches, point to continued strong consumer interest.
On the other hand, additional insight from our customers regarding Invisalign in their practices indicate that more adult patients were delaying or pushing out acceptance of their ClinCheck treatment plans this summer and early fall, possibly due to concerns about the economy.
Several recent analyst reports, based on AFG research, suggests that conditions within the dental space during the calendar third quarter were slightly less desirable than in the second quarter; and AFG reports developed for Align corroborates these trends. Several weeks ago, at an analyst meeting, Patterson Dental discussed a slowdown for dental consumables.
Beyond all this survey work done, there remains a dichotomy between the tougher economic realities for the broader economy and the actual case starts we had in Q3, when compared to the optimistic views in Invisalign as sounded by both consumers and doctors.
For Q3, total Invisalign case volume was 92,500, an increase of 17% year over year, driven by growth across all customer channels. This was especially the case for North American orthodontists and international doctors, which both increased about 20% in the same quarter last year.
On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign case volume decreased 3%, primarily due to North American GPs, which declined 7%. For North American orthodontists, Q3 case volume of 35,900 cases increased 19% year over year, driven primarily from growth across nearly all Invisalign products, especially Invisalign Teen.
Q3 volume increased 1% from Q2, reflecting lower Invisalign Full cases, offset by the growth from Invisalign Teen cases, which increased 34% sequentially among North American orthos.
The Invisalign Teen product is primarily targeted at younger teens, 11 to 15 years old; and has specific features, such as compliance indicators and eruption tabs to address the needs of these younger patients. For Q3, total Invisalign Teen case shipments were 15,300 cases worldwide, an increase of 30% year over year, and 29% sequentially, a positive indication of continued progress.
As expected, both orthos and some GPs took advantage of the Invisalign Teen/Vivera Retainer promotion we ran this quarter in North America, which includes a free Vivera Retainer subscription for every Invisalign Teen case a customer buys.
Just as a reminder, the objective of this promotion is to drive penetration of Invisalign in the teenage orthodontic segment during the summer season, and generate broader trial and use of Vivera Retainers. During Q3 last year, when we first offered the Teen/Vivera promotion, we saw a strong uptick in Invisalign Teen cases; and this year, we saw a similar uptick.
Over the past 12 months, the doctors who participated in the promotion have subsequently grown their Invisalign Teen and Vivera case volumes faster than doctors who did not participate.
In addition to reporting our results for the Invisalign Teen product, we also track the total number of teenagers using any Invisalign product, which is a more complete view of our penetration in this very important segment of the orthodontic market.
During Q3, a total of 24,500 teenagers worldwide started treatment with Invisalign. This is an increase of 21% sequentially and year over year, and demonstrates our continued progress and share gain among teens 11 to 19 years old worldwide.
For North American GP dentists, Q3 case volume of 34,700 cases increased 12% year over year, driven by growth across all Invisalign products, especially Invisalign Express. On a sequential basis, Q3 GP volume decreased 7% from Q2, due to lower Invisalign Full and Assist cases. We believe softness in higher-end adult procedures like full-mouth restorations, veneers, and Invisalign may have played a part.
But our customers outside of North America, Invisalign volume of 21,900 increased 21% year over year, the fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth for international. This growth was driven primarily by an increase from Invisalign distributors, especially the Asia-Pacific region, as well as from nearly all European countries that we cover directly.
As expected, Invisalign case volume outside North America was down slightly, around 3% sequentially, reflecting summer seasonality primarily in southern Europe. In our direct geographies, Q3 year-over-year growth in core Europe was led by the UK; and the CEU, we call it, comprised of Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
Italy volumes were down compared to last year. And while the signs of economic distress and austerity measures are obvious, we also had an execution miss. We have new country leadership in place there, and expect to find our way back to a growth posture, much like what we did in the UK two years ago.
And in Asia, Q3 Invisalign case starts in China continued to ramp while Japan continues its growth track. We see strong business growth in China, which we believe is being driven by our strategy of working with key opinion leaders, going deep with top orthodontists in core cities.
We had a strong presence at the annual Chinese Orthodontic Meeting held in Peking University in September, where we saw the first wave of Chinese KOLs, our orthodontist customers, speaking about Invisalign in a scientific session; presenting Invisalign, the technology, as well as finished and cases in progress.
This represents a major step forward as we now have domestic, in-country Chinese KOLs carrying the message and promoting Invisalign. We will continue to execute on our core strategy, which is working; combined with ongoing tests to best understand the local levers, how to best accelerate volume here in China. We remain very bullish in the long-term potential for this country.
In Q4, we will expand our focus on clinical education. And we'll be hosting over 20 leading Chinese doctors at the North Asian Invisalign Forum in Macau, which will bring together top clinicians worldwide to discuss treatment of very complex cases. And in November, a handful of Chinese doctors will also attend our Ortho Summit in Las Vegas.
Q3 was another great quarter for our Invisalign distribution partners in APAC, EMEA and Latin American regions. Year over year as well as sequential growth was driven by continued strength in the APAC region, especially Australia and Hong Kong.
As a result of our continued success in the APAC region, and with the upcoming expiration of the distribution agreement with our partner there, we have decided to revert Asia-Pacific into a direct sales region beginning May 1, 2013. We will be taking back the APAC organization, including its entire team and operating expense structure.
We will step up investments in the form of increased OpEx during our fourth and first quarters in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers. In the near term, this increased operating expense committed towards continued APAC growth and organizational continuity will create a little more operating margin pressure.
After May 1 next year, we will begin to recognize direct sales in our full ASP rather than the significantly discounted ASP under the distribution agreement; and will thereby quickly gain revenue and contribution margin leverage. The overall economic cost of this reversion has less than a one-year payback for us.
On a year-over-year basis, we saw a continued adoption across our customer base in Q3, but primarily by North American doctors, which is reflected in our key Invisalign metrics of utilization and new customer training.
Year-over-year ortho volume growth was driven by both an increase in Invisalign utilization, as well as an increase in number of new ortho submitters. Year-over-year GP volume growth was driven primarily by an increase in newly trained GP submitters. Sequentially, Q3 utilization rates remained flat among North American orthos and international doctors; while North American GPs actually decreased, due to lower case volumes and fewer submitters.
Among our North American GP base, we saw a decrease in Invisalign case starts across all customer tiers; in particular, our mid- to high-volume GPs. As expected, we trained fewer doctors in Q3 as we typically hold fewer CE1 training events during the summer timeframe.
Moving on to product innovation, I'm excited to be talking about one of the most important innovations in invisible orthodontics, our new SmartTrack aligner material. Over the past five years, working with world-class partners, we have evaluated literally thousands of polymers and a variety of other materials. Our goal was to optimize conformance and comfort for the patient with the ability to consistently deliver planned forces over an extended period of time, and to ensure greater predictability for even the most complex cases.
Today, we introduced a remarkable material to the world of Clear Aligner treatment we call SmartTrack. SmartTrack is a novel, highly elastic new aligner material that delivers gentle, more constant force to improve the control of tooth movements within Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment.
SmartTrack represents not just an improvement in aligner material. It's a significant improvement in the entire Invisalign system, and how we leverage force systems for more predictable tooth movement. We have specifically engineered a flexible material that more precisely conforms to tooth morphology, attachments, and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement across treatment.
We initiated a large-scale pilot with over 1000 customers in May, and the analysis of patients treated with these aligners shows statistically significant improvement in control of tooth movements, especially for the most difficult, such as rotations and extrusions.
According to Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist in Seguin, Texas and a member of our Clinical Advisory Board, and I quote, the clinical results with SmartTrack have been excellent so far. The fit around the teeth from aligner to aligner is better than with any group of patients I've previously treated with Invisalign in my practice. Without a doubt, SmartTrack is the most exciting change in Invisalign technology among the many that have been introduced in recent years. Close quote.
And from Dr. Werner Schupp, an orthodontist practicing in Koln, Germany, said, and I quote, I'm very pleased with the new SmartTrack aligner material. The aligners fit better and are more comfortable for our patients. And the tooth movement is more precise in all directions. End of quote.
The feedback to date from our pilot doctors has been very positive, and we can't wait for all of our customers and their patients to experience these revolutionary changes for themselves.
In Q1 2013, SmartTrack will become the standard Invisalign aligner material for Invisalign Clear Aligners in North America and Europe, as well as in other international markets where regulatory approval has been obtained.
In the meantime, we have been begun previewing SmartTrack material on our customer portal, aligntechinstitute.com. In addition, we will showcase SmartTrack at our upcoming Ortho Summit in November. And in January, we will host an ask-the-expert webinar in advance of the worldwide launch of SmartTrack.
As for our integrated consumer marketing platform, activity on our consumer website is a good measure of progress on this front, where prospective patients can get more information; take an interactive smile assessment, based on their own goals for treatment; and search for Invisalign providers in their area.
During Q3, we passed a big milestone and ended the quarter with more than 4.2 million visitors to invisalign.com to date this year, a nice increase from the same period in 2011. In addition, website leads are up, and find-a-doc searches are up from the same time last year. We also continue to see increasing traffic from mobile device users, with visitors to the invisalign.com mobile site now making up around a quarter of our total traffic when our ads are on TV.
All of these metrics tell us that prospective patients remain interested in learning more about Invisalign, and for connecting with providers in their local area when they are ready to seriously consider treatment. Website traffic, like many of our consumer metrics, is positively influenced by our on-air TV presence. In early Q3, we continued leveraging the peak teen season by running our Twins TV spots to reach moms and teens. Normally we would have stayed consistently on-air with these spots through the end of August, but this year we were off-air for three weeks in July to avoid competing with the airtime around the Olympics.
However, we supplemented our TV presence during those important final summer months with radio, digital and traditional PR, as well as event marketing. This included our second year sponsoring radio Disney's Next Big Thing Tour, which integrates elements from all of these marketing channels, including a lot of Disney radio and TV placements.
Moving now to our Scanner and CAD/CAM Services segment, Q3 revenue was $9.8 million, compared to $11.9 million in Q2, and $11.6 million in Q3 last year; and it reflects summer seasonality. In addition, there were no major industry or Invisalign customer events that would have given us additional selling opportunities, like the AAO meeting in May 2012 and the GP Summit in July of 2011.
These major trade shows and customer events, like Invisalign Summits, provide a unique opportunity to present iTero scanners and close orders there. Turning to the announcement we made regarding our Straumann distribution agreements for iTero scanners -- since acquiring Cadent 18 months ago, we have been committed to enabling a digital shift within restorative dentistry, with the iTero scanners the center of our strategy.
We have worked with Straumann over the past few years to establish a sales, services, and support model for the iTero scanner that would benefit both our companies. The global market for restorative dentistry is far more fragmented and complex than orthodontics, with hundreds of thousands of labs, suppliers, general dentists, and specialists.
In Europe, adoption of digital restorative technology has been further slowed due to challenging economic conditions, some reluctance to invest in capital equipment. Despite our efforts, our collaboration for distributing iTero scanners is not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. As a result, Align has decided to market iTero on a more limited basis directly in Europe, focusing on our existing Invisalign customers; and pursue global scanner potential on a more opportunistic basis.
We will continue our direct sales of iTero scanners in North America, where digital dentistry is evolving more rapidly. Over the past year we have invested in our scanner business in North America by doubling the number of direct sales representatives and in-office trainers through ongoing improvements in scanner service and support, and through our robust product and applications development pipeline.
We have demonstrated this business model can work, and we are confident we have the best-performing scanner in the market. Both Align and Straumann are committed to ensuring a continued high level of support and service for existing iTero customers in Europe and North America. Straumann will continue to offer first-level equipment support in Europe for at least the next 12 months, after which full responsibility for regional customer service will transfer to Align.
We are currently working together on plans for a smooth transition, and will communicate details to customers as soon as they are finalized.
I'll now turn the call over to Ken for a review of our Q3 financial results. Ken?
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Thanks, Tom. Before reviewing the preliminary results for the quarter, I will begin by discussing the status of our goodwill impairment testing. The discontinuation of Align's distribution relationship with Straumann in Europe and North America, and the decline in results of operations of the Company's Scanner and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit, triggered the risk that the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Cadent might be impaired.
As a result, we are currently conducting a step one test as of September 30, 2012, to assess whether goodwill -- which had a carrying value of $135.3 million as of September 30, 2012 -- is impaired. We expect to complete the step one impairment test prior to the filing of our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.
If the result of our step one analysis indicate an impairment, we will conduct a step two evaluation to determine the amount of the non-cash impairment charge, if any. If step two cannot be completed prior to filing of the Form 10-Q for the third quarter, we may estimate a range of potential impairment and may report an estimated non-cash charge for the third quarter of 2012.
Any difference between an estimate and the final step two evaluation would be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Before I move on to the third-quarter financial results, I'd like to remind everybody that there are several items we exclude from our GAAP results when we report non-GAAP results. These include acquisition and integration costs, amortization of intangible assets, and severance and benefits costs for the New Jersey consolidation.
In my comments today, I will not review the total dollars excluded for non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses and operating margin; and instead, will refer you to the press release table as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics, and the business outlook summary for a complete reconciliation.
Now let's review our preliminary third-quarter financial results, which do not include the impact of any potential goodwill impairment. Q3 net revenue was a total of $136.5 million, which consisted of Invisalign revenue of $126.7 million, and Scanner and CAD/CAM Services revenue of $9.8 million. This is a sequential decrease of 6.3% from $145.6 million in quarter two, 2012; and a year-over-year increase of 8.4% from $125.9 million in Q3 2011.
Q3 Invisalign revenue of $126.7 million decreased 5.2% compared to Q2 revenue of $133.7 million, and increased 10.9% compared to Q3 2011 revenue of $114.3 million. The sequential decrease in Q3 revenue was driven by lower case volumes, primarily across our North America GP and international doctors, as well as from slightly lower Invisalign ASPs.
And Invisalign ASPs were lower as expected compared to last quarter, due to deferrals associated with the Invisalign Teen Vivera Retainer promotion and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign revenue growth was driven by volume increases, offset somewhat by foreign exchange rates.
Q3 Scanner and CAD/CAM Services revenue was $9.8 million, which is a sequential decrease of 18.3% from $11.9 million in Q2 2012, and a year-over-year decrease of 15.9% from $11.6 million in Q3 2011. The scanner volumes were down as expected, as there were no major industry or Company-sponsored event in which to leverage scanner selling opportunities as compared to Q2, where we had the AAO show and several customer forums. Q3 CAD/CAM Services were flat in North America as compared to the prior quarter, and international had minimal contribution.
Now, moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Q3 GAAP gross margin was $100.4 million or 73.5%. And this compares to $108.8 million or 74.7% in quarter two; and $92.4 million or 73.4% in the same quarter of last year.
Q3 GAAP gross margin for Invisalign was 77.6%, and Scanner and CAD/CAM Services was 20.6%. This compares to 79% and 26.6%, respectively, in quarter two. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was $100.7 million or 73.7%. And this compares to $109.2 million or 75% in quarter two, and $93 million or 73.9% in the same quarter of last year.
For Invisalign, there was no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 or Q2 of 2012; and Q3 of 2011. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects lower Invisalign case volume, which resulted in under-absorption of manufacturing costs and the impact from lower ASPs.
For Scanner and CAD/CAM Services, Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 23.8% compared to 30.3% last quarter. The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin reflects lower production volumes, which drove under-absorption of manufacturing spend, coupled with excess training capacity during the seasonally slower summer quarter.
Q3 GAAP operating expense was $71.2 million compared to Q2 of $72.8 million, and $66.1 million from the same quarter of last year. Q3 non-GAAP operating expense was $70 million. This compares to $71.6 million in quarter two, and $63.8 million in the same quarter of last year.
The decrease in Q3 non-GAAP operating expense is primarily due to lower media spending as we went off-air during the Olympics, as well as fewer industry and customer events being held in quarter three.
Q3 GAAP operating income was $29.2 million or 21.4%. This compares to $36 million or 24.7% in the quarter two, and $26.3 million or 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $30.6 million or 22.4%, and this compares to $37.6 million or 25.8% in quarter two, and $29.2 million or 23.2% in the same quarter of last year.
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29 compared to $0.34 in quarter two, and $0.24 in the same quarter of last year. And Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compared to $0.34 in quarter two, and $0.27 in Q3 of last year.
Now moving onto the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term investments, were $348.9 million. This compares to $248.1 million at the end of 2011. In Q3, we generated roughly $40.3 million in cash from operations, compared to $27.3 million in quarter two and $41.5 million in the same quarter last year.
DSOs for the quarter were 70 days compared to 63 days in quarter two, and 62 days in the same quarter last year. The increase in DSO this quarter primarily reflects less shipment linearity in the quarter, and a slight slowing of customer payments in September. Overall, our aging remains in solid shape, and I would expect DSOs to trend downwards in Q4.
Under our stock repurchase program, we bought approximately 213,000 shares of our common stock during quarter three, at an average price of $34.15 per share, for a total of approximately $7.3 million. There remains $132.5 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.
Now let's turn to our business outlook for Q4 2012 and the factors that have formed our view. First, we experienced greater-than-expected summer seasonality in North America from both GP dentists and orthodontist. This softness has persisted into October, which resulted in lower case receipts from which Q4 shipments will be generated. However, busy sales force activity and patient traffic in October points to renewed growth for the Invisalign business.
Second, Q4 is historically a stronger quarter for international doctors as they come back from summer vacation, and we would expect that to be the case this year as well.
Third, Q4 is historically the heaviest buying period for capital equipment purchases in North America. In order to make the most of this year-end buying cycle, we are offering a promotional $4000 off an iTero scanner in quarter four. There are also two major events that we will be leveraging in quarter four, the ADA meeting going on in San Francisco this week, and our Invisalign Ortho Summit in November.
As a result of these sales and promotional activities, we expect North American scanner sales to increase nicely from Q3. For international, we do not expect any contribution, due to the termination of the iTero distribution agreements with Straumann announced today.
And lastly, given the softness we've seen recently, we are more cautious about consumer behavior in the near-term, and their willingness to move forward with higher-value procedures like Invisalign.
With that as a backdrop, we anticipate Invisalign case volumes to be in a range of 90,000 to 93,000 cases. We expect Q4 total revenues to be in a range of $134.2 million to $137.8 million. Overall, we expect our revenue outlook to have a slight impact from Invisalign ASPs resulting from advantage rebates and product mix, offset by not running the Teen Vivera promotion in quarter four.
We will be running a new promotion in quarter four, for Invisalign Express 5, which offers doctors $200 off the list price and is intended to drive higher trial and repeat use. Q4 revenues also reflect lower iTero scanner ASPs due to the year-end iTero scanner promotion I just mentioned.
Now let's move on to gross margin. We expect Q4 GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 71.7% to 72.1%. And we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be a range of 71.9% to 72.3%. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects expected increases in freight costs related to international shipments, and an increase in training costs as we plan to train more doctors in quarter four; and, to a lesser extent, ASPs.
In Q4, we expect GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $73.6 million to $74.9 million. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be a range of $72.6 million to $73.9 million. The expected sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expense relates to a greater number of customer events like the ADA meeting, the Greater New York Dental show, and our Ortho Summit. Additionally, we will be increasing our investment for Asia Pac to ensure a smooth transition back to a direct sales region.
We expect Q4 GAAP operating margin to be a rage of 16.9% to 17.7%, and GAAP EPS to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23, excluding any impact from potential impairment charges. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to be in a range of 17.8% to 18.7%, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be a range of $0.21 to 0.23.
In Q4, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 84.5 million, and cash on hand to be in a range of $385 million to $395 million.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Tom for some closing comments.

Thanks, Ken. In summary, the team here at Align is as excited about the future as I've ever seen them, and it's easy for me to understand why. With over 1000 enthusiastic customers participating in a large commercialization pilot, we are hearing that SmartTrack is the biggest innovation in Invisalign technology ever. And when combined with the G3 and G4 steps which preceded them, enables treatment of far more complex cases with greater patient comfort.
We're in the process of bringing our APAC distribution back in-house, gaining greater confidence in our ability to drive the business in our fastest-growing geographies in the world. We are restaging growth in Europe, even in regions like the UK, where austerity programs and slow-to-zero growth are the norm.
We continue to do well with our scanner business in North America, where our direct sales model is successfully leveraging our Invisalign resources. In China, we continue to see strong Invisalign growth and remain bullish on its long-term potential. And around the world, we continue to gain share in the important teenager market.
We are not satisfied with the recent quarter, or our Q4 guidance. Yet know this still describes a business growing volume over 16% annually, with huge headroom remaining for expansion. We intend to continue on with good execution of our important strategic initiatives, and have the confidence we will deliver great results for our customers and their patients, our shareholders and our committed employees.
I look forward to seeing some of you while out at trade shows and investor events over the next few months; as well as reporting back to you with our progress in a quarter or so.
And with that, let's get right to the Q&A.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Matt Dolan, ROTH Capital Partners.
Matt Dolan
- ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. The first one I just wanted to dig into what you are seeing on the growth side of the equation first. I think if we look back to -- I think it was two years ago, you struggled out of the summer, and there were some executional issues then that I think you may have referred to here again.
Normally you guys have a lot of visibility into the upcoming quarter. So what can you tell us, on a go-forward basis, about either stability or -- I think you said in your prepared remarks, there is renewed interest in Q4, despite what sounds like what has been a pretty slow September and October.
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure, Matt, thanks. Well, the first thing I'll refer back to is this dichotomy that has existed between the channel checks we and others have done, and -- that still showing strong consumer interest, yet not necessarily translating into Invisalign case starts.
What I'd say is, we've seen some renewed activity, now, into October a bit. And we believe that will start to generate. The second thing, I think, if you're referring back to a couple of years ago, we do expect Europe to contribute more towards growth in Q4, where we did not have that outlook, say, in Q4 of two years ago.
Again, we think the business is healthy. We wish we had all the answers. I think there's probably a few -- maybe broader secular trends going on in the dentistry that others have called out. But what we're going to try and do is make just make sure that the activity in the offices turns into case starts, and that's what we're focused on.
Matt Dolan
- ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst
Maybe to clarify with two specific points. I think you guys did say that you felt like there was a renewed interest in Q4, even though October was slow. So, again, is this something maybe -- did the promotions that came early in Q2 pull some revenue that you otherwise would've thought you had into earlier in the year? What gives you that thought, that things are picking up later this quarter?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Let me be as clear as I can. We're sitting here now on the 17th. And as we are managing actively, we are hearing a lot of activity in the offices. Patients are coming back into the offices. And this is -- and I'll contrast that with two years ago, when we still did not have what seemed like positive activity, even when we went to our call in October.
And that, in fact, did not pick up until late in November, mid- to late November, early December. So we see the signs of good activity -- doctors are reporting, calendars are filling up again, and there are a lot of good signs. We'll watch that closely. That is reflected in our view going forward.
If I take, specifically, the comment -- in this business, with a customized case, I don't think our doctors have the ability to really pull cases in much or delay them much. They are going to make the assumption that if -- when a patient wants to start treatment -- if they don't want to start them, that patient will probably find some other place to go.
So I don't think -- we had a very strong Q1 and a pretty strong Q2; that was not promotion-driven. There were a lot of doctors working hard to get Into Elite status or Super Elite status for Advantage; and then, I think some of them may have taken some more time off this summer. We wish we had -- I'll call, a more analytically sound view of all that. But in parallel with that, there were broader softness trends reported across dentistry, both by consultants and researchers, market researchers, as well as some other companies.
So, again, we'll be watching closely as the bigger dental players come behind us. And maybe there will be a broader explanation for these secular trends in dentistry.
Matt Dolan
- ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst
Okay. And then the second topic I wanted to make sure we touched on was on the earnings guidance side of the equation. Obviously, revenues are expected to be flat. It looks like really the major difference quarter to quarter here into Q4 is the gross margin.
I know you mentioned, Ken, freight costs; but to us, it seems like international has been relatively flat or even down as a percentage of sales. So why the 200 basis point hit there, which is a big part of the delta between the two periods? Thank you.
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Sure, no problem. Freight -- as we shipped more and more product internationally, it costs us more to get the product over there with the volume that we're looking at on a historical basis in the growth on the international business. We're expecting that to grow nicely again this year. And given where we are, we're expecting our freight costs to be up on a sequential basis over Q3.
If you think about Q3, volumes were down in Europe as they typically are, so when you go on a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4, you have a greater impact of freight for those international shipments. Also with the shipments growing faster in the Asia Pac region, again that picks up additional freight costs to get product over to Asia Pac as opposed to Europe, say, for example.

Thanks a lot. Tom, I just wanted to talk to you about the weakness in the case shipment growth this quarter. Now, if you look at where the weakness was, it seems like North American GPs was clearly the worst segment, down the most sequentially, where you actually had positive growth in the North American orthodontic community; and international did somewhere in the middle.
Is there something to be said here about the trends at the general practitioner in 2Q -- or, I'm sorry, 3Q, that you think could reverse itself in 4Q? Or do you feel like -- just give us some feedback and what your sales guys are telling you about what they are seeing in the market.
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Let me break down into two pieces. First, about maybe what happened; and second, about how we see it going forward. First, in terms of what we saw playing out in Q3 -- and I think you've chronicled this pretty well-- I think in the GP office there was a softness, there was a slowdown. There have been reports of -- especially in the higher-value procedures area on both coast; LA, New York, -- some of the higher-value procedures like full mouth restorations and veneers, that really slowing down significantly.
In general, with our GP practices, even our higher-volume customers, which of all the groups really slowed down the most, they tend to react more to patient traffic coming in and people asking for procedures rather than initiating those conversations. So when patients are more passive or when traffic goes down, they tend to pull back, and don't compensate by initiating more. They literally just pull back a bit more, so it's a different reaction.
For the ortho, the specialist, they're used to dealing with referrals, whether it came from their own efforts or from a GP that they work with. And they're used to jumping on those points of interest, whether it's the first call or a patient coming that's really seriously considering.
In the summer, we really didn't do that well with adults. To the extent ortho was soft, it was there. We did pretty well with teens, but not as well year over year. So our belief is, we continued to take share from traditional brackets and wires, but that adults were a push for ortho. Putting it another way, if we didn't have the progress we're making in teen, we would have been -- we would have much worse results. I don't mean to look at it as a negative thing -- we'd have worse results.
The work we've done in the last 4 to 5 years to bring the teen product to market and to start -- continue to take share, has put us in a position where we no longer are so disadvantaged in the summer. This summer, adults pushed out substantially on the GP side. And I think they also pushed a bit on the ortho side.
Going forward, with better traffic in the GP office we're hearing about; better traffic in the ortho office; a lot of other things going on; we believe that we can get some of that back. We're not going to stand on our heads right now. But I think we can make progress in Q4. And I think there was an earlier question about comparing 2010.
With Europe kicking in nicely, we think we'll -- we can go back and get this guidance. It's working tough through this difficult economic times.
Glen Santangelo
- Credit Suisse - Analyst
Well, Tom, I appreciate all that detail. And we haven't had a chance to work on our model; but just looking at the guidance that you've given for 4Q, it kind of assumes that you're looking at maybe flattish case shipment growth. Just want to be clear on what you're saying, because it sounds like October started off kind of sluggish. But yet I thought in that -- in your answer to my question, you just sort of said you're starting to see a little bit of a pickup in activity. In terms of case shipment growth, what are you building into expectations on a sequential basis in Q4?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. As Ken described well, the softness that we saw persist into September and into October, that's the basis of our October shipments; what's shipping to patients and customers right now. And when that is softer, obviously, October shipments -- therefore revenues, a little softer.
We've seen in other years where Q4 can finish very strongly. The first thing that has to happen is activity in offices translating into case starts; ultimately, those ClinChecks being approved, and then shipments. That feels like that's turning a bit. It certainly is stronger than it was in September, as we reported.
While we can't get the September volume receipts any higher than they are -- they are what they are -- that anchors October shipments for all practical purposes, but we do see building on that as we leave October with growing receipts into November and December. And we would hope to build on that trend through the quarter.

Thank you. Brandon Couillard, Jeffries.

Thanks for taking the question. Tom, to what degree do you think Dentsply coming back on the market with its ortho products may have had an impact in the third quarter in terms of the case volumes?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Good question; and we actually have looked at that pretty hard. We've done some survey work from a variety of sources. And we -- our data shows that we're still nicely taking share from all categories of brackets; traditional, self-ligating, et cetera, and that's in teen and adult.
So we think if -- GAC products coming back on, which is a good thing -- they are an important part of this industry, and that was a tough deal for them. But that's probably coming out of the hide of somebody else in the brackets and wires side; does not appear to be a factor for us.
Brandon Couillard
- Jefferies & Company - Analyst
Okay. And then have you finalized your plan in terms of how you expect to handle the US medical device excise tax that goes into effect next year? And to what degree do you think you'll be able to pass that on through incremental pricing or the expense reductions, if at all?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
I would say, like every other medical device company, we're working our tails off to both prepare systems and capabilities to be able to do this, even though there's no rulemaking in place yet at the IRS. I think the simple fact is, we're working on all our options. And I would say that that still -- process in place. And will talk about it much more fully when we do guidance and our view of how we're going to handle all of this, this time next quarter.
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Yes, Brandon, if I add on to that, we're going through our annual planning cycle right now. And it's certainly one of the things we'll take into account as we go through that process over the next couple of months, on how to handle the med tech tax. Right now we are looking at just being able to handle it from a perspective of doing the appropriate reporting on a biweekly basis. As far as what we're going to do beyond that, we're still working through it.
Brandon Couillard
- Jefferies & Company - Analyst
Thanks. And then one more, Ken. Any chance you could give us the inventory balance at the end of the third quarter? And then, what CapEx was in the third quarter? And then -- looks like a much bigger number in terms of CapEx for the fourth quarter than I would have anticipated, given things like the some of the facility relocations, et cetera, are winding down now here. Just where do we stand on those two fronts?
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Sure. So, inventories at the end of September were basically $15 million, of which -- about $13 million or so of that was related to the scanner business, as we have been building up some inventory here in preparation for a move in Israel, which we actually just completed.
As far as your other question on CapEx, in quarter four we have about -- I think the guidance was about $12 million or so of CapEx -- about $11 million, $12 million of CapEx. And that has to do with some additional equipment we're buying to put down in the facility in Juarez to handle increased capacity over time here; as well as some of our outfitting of some facilities, costs and stuff like that from a leasehold improvement point of view.
As far as CapEx this quarter, we spent -- I think it was about $6 million or so; (multiple speakers) CapEx in Q3. And, again, it was mostly related to manufacturing equipment.

Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, given what we're looking at now for the fourth quarter revenue, looking like it's into the single digits on an organic basis growth, can you walk us through the steps that get you back to the 15% to 25% growth that you are looking for over the longer term?
Your confidence is clearly not shaken here, so just walk us through the macro, new features, and any sort of recovery drivers in the business that you think you can quantify to get us back to that 15% to 25%.
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. I'll reinforce that I don't feel we're in recovery mode. Certainly not satisfied with our results in Q3 or the guidance we've given in Q4 against the profile we've been running with; but we are not in recovery mode at all. The drivers -- I've said before, this business won't be perfect and it won't be perfectly linear, and we've demonstrated both of those here.
The reality is, we have -- adoption grows, core utilization grows among, say, orthodontists in a nonlinear way. When we bring out new technologies that the earliest adopters, the highest volume users, the most technique-sensitive users get a chance to get after it. And then they start trying those new features on more and more kinds of cases.
One of the things that gives us confidence is that we see the feedback on a broad-ranging commercialization pilot with a wide range of orthodontist and GPs. The feedback is unanimously positive, and very strong. While the SmartTrack material is by itself remarkably different, clearer looking, more comfortable, easier to remove, easier to place on, it also has very unique properties which has been our search for the last five years. And movements happen on time better.
What we expect is, as we commercialize it, as we really roll it out in Q1, the feedback that we're getting from doctors now, they will do more cases and they will do more complex cases. Think of that, first of all, as a great thing for patients and the doctors. And then, secondly, it's kind of a multiplier for the other advancements that have come before it, because now you're really able to take advantage of SmartForce technologies with the attachment technology and the new force systems. So we can now really precisely deliver force systems and do it in a way that's better for the patient and the doc.
We expect this over the next couple of years. Again, we've been after this for five years. Over the next couple of years, we expect that to reinforce core adoption. And I'll remind you, we have -- given even as where we are, which we've done pretty well -- we're still a very small player in unit and unit share. And we have tons of headroom in virtually every orthodontic indication.
Our goal is -- looking at a graph on our wall -- is making sure we grow penetration. Whether it's a deep bite, open bite, class II, division two, whatever it might be, we're going to drive penetration into that indication. And so SmartTrack plus SmartForce lets us do that.
Second thing is, we continue implementing evolution and improvements in our sales force, our coverage model, and our execution. A good example of that is what we're seeing in Europe. In the most difficult of circumstances, they grew nicely through the worst seasonal period. And they grew nicely in the UK. And the UK is no better than it was two years ago, really.
But we've got better coverage in place; we're running better programs; and we're tracking and measuring our efficiency at a rep-by-rep level. I'll just say, good execution, and that continues to get better. We'll see the same in North America.
And then the third thing is, in addition to innovation in technology and product, now we're innovating in market. A lot of the things we're doing on the consumer side and the smile assessment side, we're really getting good traction. More and more potential consumers that want to be patients are actually opting in with us and asking us to stay with them all the way through their treatment. So we're gaining insights into how they think about selecting a doctor and what that whole search process looks like, all the way through their success and satisfaction with final treatment.
A measurable percentage of visitors now are, in effect, opting in with us. And that's a real honor for us, to have them let us be part of that treatment path. There are a lot of good indicators for us. Again, not going to roll around in it, but we're really not satisfied with the results we posted or the guidance we provided, and we expect to fix that.
Steve Beuchaw
- Morgan Stanley - Analyst
Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just one on Cadent, kind of big-picture. The business, it seems like year on year was down a couple million on a base of about $11.5 million; so down $1.5 million on a base of $11.5 million. I think the expectations are for this to be a real growth market, but the environment is evolving pretty quickly.
You have three, maybe five, new competitors on the market next year. But of course you have been advantaged position, being one of the bigger players in the market. Is that a business that you can get to growth in the double digits next year? Or at the other extreme, if something like what we've seen in this quarter, and with the expectations for price to come down effectively next quarter, is that more of an appropriate way to think about it, as it's more of a driver for the aligner business? Can you help us parse out the different pieces there? And I'll drop, thanks.
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. Thanks, Steve. Well, there's really two things. First of all, we believe, and have reinforced, that this is a very strategic part of a very early evolution, a major evolution, in the dental industry. Being able to be at chair side, capture digital data, be able to bring a wider set of applications to the dentist or the specialist, is a very big deal. And with few exceptions, Sirona being one where they've been at it for 27 years; and they've built a significant installed base and can sell into that with upgrades.
There are very few companies today that I'd say standalone on a scanner base have got big businesses. We've got one of the biggest installed base is out there, but we still think we're getting started. Over time, we believe this, on its own merits, can be a very successful business and return to growth. It is pretty lumpy right now, given uncertainty and all those other things, and even more so in Europe.
But we believe that the kind of growth rates that were identified by iData and other third parties are there to be had. But we've taken a longer-term view of this business. What I'd say is -- so that's one way to think about the iTero scanner itself. We do believe we can scale that. We do, and still intend to -- I'll say, we're chasing Sirona, so maybe we won't have the absolute biggest installed base; we believe we'll have the best in terms of the highest-performing scanners that can do all indications, all procedures, full arch.
Now there's a bunch of new players coming out. We haven't seen anything from anybody that gets close to what we can do in terms of scanner functionality or utility. But the good news is, greater competition here is going to mean wider adoption and a hastening of this evolution towards digital dentistry. We're okay with competition, and consider it a long-term race.
The second part of that is, you asked about Invisalign. I'm not going to quote the numbers here, but we continue to see a substantial amount of our income in cases now done by scans. And it's a meaningful number, and growing very nicely every single quarter. I'll just say friction goes down for everybody involved -- the patient, the doctor and the practice and Align, in so many ways. It's faster, better, cheaper, easier, more precise. Aligners seem to fit better. The whole cycle of case to shipment is faster. And that's a trend that's continuing.
The second thing is, the doctors that use -- let's just pick on orthos for a second -- if I take all the orthos that have put scanners in, there's a meaningful number of increased cases. They are doing more than every other cohort around them, whether they were a small low-volume, a medium-volume or a high-volume ortho.
On average, they're doing a significantly greater number of cases on a quarterly or annual basis. And that's just, again, from reducing friction. We are in the early stages of this, but there's a lot of positive signs. And we are in this for the long term.

Jeremy Feffer

Good afternoon, thanks. A couple of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to come back to pricing very quickly. This is -- once again, we saw average revenue per case down. I know a lot of this is tied to a lot of the promotional activities, volume rebates.
Where is the -- I don't want to say endgame -- but where does this trend go as we look into next year? Obviously the promotions, with this quarter notwithstanding, promotions have obviously done a great job in driving volume growth. Is there a point where you are worried about slowing down the promotional activities and seeing a slowdown in volume growth? Or how do you think about overall pricing going into the next year or so?
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Sure. Jeremy, this is Ken. I guess I'd start out by saying pricing has been very stable for us over the past number of years. We haven't changed prices for a number of years now on our products. And what we've chosen to do is, at various points in time, run pointed promotions.
For example, we ran the Teen Vivera promotion this summer. We got some great benefit out of that, as we indicated on the call. It costs us a little bit. But we're getting greater trial of our teen product as well or as our Vivera product with the doctors. So over the long term, we think it's a good opportunity to be a growth driver in the business.
We run our Advantage programs for the doctors on a consistent basis on a year-over-year. We see doctors continuing to move up over time in the number of cases that they're doing. Some quarters, they move faster than others. This last quarter, the biggest impact to ASPs from a promotional point of view, was certainly the Teen Vivera promotion on a sequential basis. And the other piece that you didn't mention was really foreign exchange rates.
They moved pretty quickly from Q2 to Q3. So with our international shipments we've got impacted there as well. Our view is that we'll continue to look at promotions at appropriate times in the year for the business, on both the Invisalign side as well as the iTero side of the business. For example, the $4000 off promotion we're running in quarter four here to stimulate more placements of scanners in the marketplace and gaining some more share there.
Jeremy Feffer
- Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst
Okay. And then just very quickly on the competitive side, are you guys seeing any pickup in activity from any of the newer entrants in the Clear Aligner space?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
No, not really. This is Tom. We watch this very, very carefully. And I think if there is a little -- so we are a, we're more than holding share for the other small players that are out there in Clear Aligner and ortho. In GP we may have had a little leakage, we think -- call it that -- against Clear Correct we think, frankly, even Q1 and Q2, especially among lower-volume GPs.
And we think most of that was price-driven, maybe through Groupon and stuff like that. But we don't see any kind of longer-term trends. And we've not seen the kind of traction among consistent users from any other players. We see trial from time to time; and then when faced with the features they don't have and can't get, and the capabilities that other players don't have, they tend to revert back to Invisalign. That has been the pattern. We are obviously trying to find a balance between being confident and paranoid.

John Kreger, William Blair.
John Kreger
- William Blair & Company - Analyst
Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. Tom, if we can just think about the growth that you've seen in recent months from a little bit different perspective. We would certainly compare that -- it's been a tough environment in dental, but we also would have said that was probably the case a year ago, or a few quarters ago.
So if you think about -- what do you think is really going on from a broader perspective? Do you think there is a less orthodontic starts going on across the market? Or maybe less uptake by orthodontists as the excitement around G3 and G4 has perhaps faded a bit? What do you think is the bigger picture message here?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Boy, John, I'd love to sit down with you and compare databases. You guys have generally done a very thorough job. And I think it's some of all that. First of all, we had a very strong first half, and we had a very strong Q1 and carried a lot of that into Q2 with the AAO and all that.
For lack of a better description, saw less engagement starting in the summer among adults especially, people putting things off. This is not at an analytically sound level -- call it qualitative data -- far more practices, especially on the GP side, that had maybe soft calendars. They planned their two or three weeks off. And then, in the middle of July or part of August, saw a soft schedule for the week and said, let's reschedule those patients and take the week off rather than have the office open and having very few people in there.
I don't know if it was more patient-driven or practice-driven; don't know, and I'm -- we struggle to find primary data in this area that's useful. So what we're left with is the data that we can get from third parties; our own several-times-a-quarter bottoms-up and top-down views; our own qualitative and quantitative research with groups of customers.
It's a pretty mixed bag. But for whatever set of reasons, in the summer -- the late summer and into September, and even into October until a week or so ago -- it was just like the offices were less engaged. And there was less traffic, and they were kind of -- they had just backed off. And the patients -- especially adults -- weren't much in the game.
So, again, we picked up, we think, good share this summer on the teen side. We do believe, our data suggests, that it was a tough summer for ortho in general. And there are some orthodontists that have done very well. But there's others that are saying -- other than the first half of the year, the summer was not a great summer.
It is really a mixed bag. We ask ourselves if it's broad economy or if it's more a secular dental. But I guess we go back to the fact that we are not really the market; we're still very small in penetration. Let's do everything we can do to make sure our offices are engaged on Invisalign activities that tend to drive volume, and make sure docs and patients are getting what they need, and do all the things we can do.
It's a bit frustrating for us, as well, when the quarter doesn't evolve exactly as we thought it might.

Got it, got it. Okay. So just a quick follow-up. From our perspective, G3 and G4 were very well-received in the market. As you think about SmartTrack, since this is new to us, what do you think the significance is of SmartTrack, relative to G3 and G4? More or less impactful?
Tom Prescott
- Align Technology, Inc. - President, CEO
Well, we have our own views, and we always had a set of metrics we apply to any new major project innovation -- product innovation. And we track whether, quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, how we're doing against -- whether it's case complexity we're measuring, getting more, say, class II cases; whether we're looking at sorts of adoption within certain practices. So we have a set of those things set up, and we'll see how it does. But one of the very clear points of feedback since May -- well, for example, when we did the earlier pilots, the doctors that were treating patients said, I don't want to go back to the old material. Please let me keep this. And then some of them were involved in the commercialization pilot in May, the feedback has been -- please don't take this away from me. I want to keep doing this.
Their feedback is, this is bigger in a complete way, because it impacts the patients so directly; patient comfort; they're more comfortable to wear. Again, it's a lower total force, but applied more consistently. And an awful lot of orthodontic literature says that's the best way to move teeth.
And without the stress relaxation we've seen with any other material we can find. So the second part of this is, our key researchers tell us that there now we can really put the capabilities of what was embedded in G3 and G4 with our new 4 systems to work better. Now that we can apply force more consistently. So rotations will express more quickly and more predictably; extrusions; bodily translations; all those things that have been harder for aligners to do versus a bracket and wire.
There's a ton of excitement by the docs that have been working on this for a while. They say it's bigger. I'd rather say it's the right next step. And it's going to be a bigger deal to patients for sure.

Great, thanks. And then one last one. If you think about the guidance you've given us for Q4, does that guidance assume a better lift in volumes in the second half of the quarter, kind of late October and November and December? Or are you assuming more of a steady state with what you've seen so far, early days in the quarter?
Ken Arola
- Align Technology, Inc. - VP, Finance, CFO
Yes, Jon, we actually don't really comment on inter-quarter trends that we're looking at. So what we tried to point out on the call is that we saw this softness in September and into early October here. But on the contrary, we are seeing activity in doctors' offices still being pretty active. Our sales force, again, is still real active with the doctor base.
So our view is that, as Tom said, with activity picking up should help us as we go forward here. But I'd probably stop short of that, so we don't specifically comment on inter-quarter.
John Kreger

Safe Harbor and Forward Looking Statement This presentation, including financial tables, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the fourth quarter of 2012, including anticipated net revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, and the loss of key personnel. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. In addition to that information, the possibility of an impairment charge, which could result in a substantial reduction against goodwill and a commensurate charge against earnings, could have a material adverse impact on the preliminary results reported in this press release and on results during a subsequent period. While the Company expects to reflect the outcome of its impairment testing in its Form 10-Q and final reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved3
 
Goodwill Impairment Testing  The preliminary Q3 2012 results are subject to change based upon the conclusion of goodwill impairment testing being undertaken by the Company.  The discontinuation of Aligns distribution relationship with Straumann in Europe and North America and the decline in results of operations of the Companys Scanner and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit triggered the risk that the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Cadent might be impaired.  As a result, we are currently conducting a step one test as of September 30, 2012, to assess whether goodwill, which had a carrying value of $135.3 million as of September 30, 2012, is impaired. We expect to complete the step one impairment test prior to filing our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.  If the results of our step one analysis indicates an impairment, we will conduct a step two evaluation to determine the amount of the non-cash impairment charge, if any. If step two cannot be completed prior to filing our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, we may estimate a range of potential impairment and may record an estimated non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2012. Any difference between an estimate and the final step two evaluation, would be recorded in the fourth quarter 2012. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved4
 
Q3 FY2012 Overview Tom Prescott President and CEO Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved5
 
Q3 FY2012 Financial Highlights  Despite a strong summer season for Invisalign teenager cases, which increased 21% sequentially and year over year, our third quarter revenue was slightly lower than our outlook.  Q3 is historically a slower period for North American GP dentists who have fewer days in- office due to vacations as well as for International doctors who typically take extended summer holidays, especially in southern Europe.  This year summer seasonality was more pronounced in North America and as a result, we did not see the expected ramp in Invisalign cases for GPs and Orthodontists. This softness has continued through October and is reflected in our Q4 guidance, which despite that slowdown, still projects a healthy annual growth rate for the company overall, including volume growth of at least 16%. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved6 Total Invisalign Clear Aligners Scanner & CAD/CAM $136.5M $126.7M 92,515cases $9.8M QoQ (-6.3%) (-5.2%) (-2.9%) (-18.3%) YoY +8.4% +10.9% +16.6% (-15.9%)
 
Q3 FY2012 Invisalign Performance Highlights  Were taking a complete look at our results, including demand for our products and analyzing the industry and the markets in which we operate. We are evaluating a lot of data, much of which is conflicting, and none of which supports a fundamental decrease in demand for Invisalign.  On the one hand, data such as the surprisingly strong, recent consumer sentiment ratings, as well as the uptick in visitors to Invisalign.com, and Find A Doctor searches point to continued strong consumer interest. On the other hand, additional insight from our customers regarding Invisalign in their practices indicate that more adult patients were delaying or pushing out acceptance of their ClinCheck treatment plans this summer and early fall, possibly due to concerns about the economy.  Several recent analyst reports based on AFG Research suggest that conditions within the dental space during the calendar third quarter were slightly less desirable than in the second quarter and AFG reports developed for Align corroborates these trends.  Beyond all of the survey work done, there remains a dichotomy between the tougher economic realities for the broader economy and the actual case starts we had in Q3, when compared to the optimistic views on Invisalign sounded by both consumers and doctors. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved7 Invisalign Shipments Q/Q Y/Y Worldwide 92,515 (-2.9%) +16.6% NA Ortho 35,885 +1.3% +19.3% NA GP 34,725 (-6.8%) +11.6% International 21,905 (-3.0%) +20.6%
 
Q3 FY2012 Invisalign Geographic Performance North America  N.A. Orthodontists: 35,885 Invisalign Shipments, +1.3% Q/Q, +19.3% Y/Y - Year-over-year growth was driven primarily from growth across nearly all Invisalign products, especially Invisalign Teen - On a sequential basis, Q3 Ortho volume reflects lower Invisalign Full cases offset by the growth from Invisalign Teen cases which increased 34% sequentially among N.A. Orthos.  N.A. GP Dentists: 34,725 Invisalign Shipments, (-6.8%) Q/Q, +11.6% Y/Y - Year-over-year driven by growth across all Invisalign products, especially Invisalign Express. - On a sequential basis, Q3 GP volume decreased due to lower Invisalign Full and Assist cases. We believe softness in higher end adult procedures like full mouth restorations, veneers, and Invisalign may have played a part. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved8
 
Q3 FY2012 Teenage Orthodontic Segment  Q3 Invisalign Teen product cases of 15,265 or 16.5% of WW volume, +28.7% Q/Q, +30.1% Y/Y - a positive indication of our continued progress.  Invisalign Teen/Vivera Retainer promotion - As expected, both Orthos and some GPs took advantage of the Invisalign Teen/Vivera Retainer promotion we ran this quarter in North America, which includes a free Vivera Retainer subscription for every Invisalign Teen case a customer buys. - During Q3 last year, when we first offered the Teen/Vivera promotion we saw a strong uptick in Invisalign Teen cases and this year we saw a similar uptick. Over the past 12 months, the doctors who participated in the promotion have subsequently grown their Invisalign Teen and Vivera case volume faster than doctors who did not participate.  Q3 was a strong quarter for teenagers using Invisalign - 24,510 teenage cases or 26.5% of WW volume, +20.6% Q/Q, +21.5% Y/Y - demonstrates our continued progress and share gain among teens 11 to 19 worldwide.

Q3 FY2012 Invisalign Geographic Performance International  International Doctors: 21,905 Invisalign Shipments, (-3.1%) Q/Q, +20.6% Y/Y - Fourth consecutive quarter of 20%+ year-over-year growth for International. This growth was driven primarily by an increase from Invisalign distributors, especially the APAC region, as well as from nearly all direct European countries. - On a sequential basis, as expected, Invisalign case volume outside North America was down slightly (3%) sequentially, reflecting summer seasonality primarily in southern Europe.  Year-over-year growth in core Europe was led by the U.K and the CEU (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) - Italy volumes were down compared to last year and while the signs of economic distress and austerity measures are obvious, we also had an execution miss. We have new country leadership in place and expect to find our way back to a growth posture  much like what we did in the U.K. two years ago.  China and Japan - Q3 Invisalign case starts in China continued to ramp while Japan continues on its growth track. We see strong business growth in China, which we believe is being driven by our strategy of working with Key Opinion Leaders, going deep with top orthodontists in core cities. - We had a strong presence at the annual Chinese Orthodontic Meeting (COS) held at Peking University in September where we saw the first wave of Chinese KOLs (orthodontists) speaking about Invisalign in the scientific sessions  presenting Invisalign, the technology, finished and cases in progress. This represents a major step forward as we now have domestic, in-country Chinese KOLs carrying the message, promoting Invisalign. - We will continue to execute on our core strategy, which is working; combined with ongoing tests to best understand the local levers of accelerating volume here in China. We remain very bullish on the long-term potential for this country. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved11
 
APAC Distributor to Revert to Direct Sales Region Beginning May 1, 2013  Great quarter for our Invisalign distribution partners in the APAC, EMEA, and Latin America regions. - Year-over-year as well as sequential growth was driven by continued strength in the APAC region, especially Australia and Hong Kong.  As a result of our continued success in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and with the upcoming expiration of the distribution agreement with our partner there, we have decided to revert APAC into a direct sales region beginning May 1, 2013. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved12  Taking back the APAC organization as well as its entire team and operating expense structure.  We will step up investments in the form of increased OPEX during the fourth and first quarters in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers.  In the near term, this increased operating expense committed towards continued APAC growth and organizational continuity will create a little more operating margin pressure.  After May 1, we will begin to recognize direct sales at our full ASP, rather than the significantly discounted ASP under the distribution agreement, and will thereby quickly gain revenue and contribution margin leverage. The overall economic costs of this reversion have less than a one year payback.
 
Q3 FY2012 Invisalign Adoption Metrics Doctor Utilization and Training Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved13 Quarterly Doctors Trained Worldwide Average Channel Utilization  Total utilization was 4.2 cases per doctor - N.A. Orthodontists 7.7 cases/doc - Y/Y volume growth was driven by both an increase in Invisalign utilization as well as an increase in the number of new Ortho submitters. - Q/Q utilization remained flat - N.A. GP Dentists 2.9 cases/doc - Y/Y volume growth was driven primarily by an increase in newly trained GP submitters. - Q/Q utilization decreased due to lower case volumes and fewer submitters. - International 4.1 cases/doc - Q/Q utilization remained flat  1,485 new Invisalign-trained doctors - 800 North America - 685 International - As expected, we trained fewer doctors in Q3 as we typically hold fewer CE1 training events during the summer timeframe.

Announcing SmartTrack Aligner Material Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved14  SmartTrack is a significant improvement in the entire Invisalign system and how we leverage force systems for more predictable tooth movement - Specifically engineered a flexible material that more precisely conforms to tooth morphology, attachments, and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement across treatment.  Large scale pilot with 1,000+ customers in May - Analysis of patients treated shows statistically significant improvement in control of tooth movements, especially for the most difficult such as rotations and extrusions.  In Q1 2013, SmartTrack will become the standard Invisalign aligner material for Invisalign clear aligners in North America and Europe, as well as in other International markets. The clinical results with SmartTrack have been excellent so far. The fit around the teeth from aligner to aligner is better than with any group of patients I have previously treated with Invisalign in my practice. Without a doubt, SmartTrack is the most exciting change in Invisalign technology among the many that have been introduced in recent years. - Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist in Seguin, Texas and member of Aligns Clinical Advisory Board Im very pleased with the new SmartTrack aligner material. The aligners fit better and are much more comfortable for our patients, and the tooth movement is more precise in all directions. - Dr. Werner Schupp, an orthodontist practicing in Kln, Germany
 
Consumer Demand Strategy Q3 12 Program Highlights  North America  Goal to raise awareness of Invisalign and Invisalign Teen as the best option for a healthy, beautiful smile among adults and teens.  Consumer web site - During Q3, we passed a big milestone and ended the quarter with more than 4.2 million visitors to Invisalign.com to date this year, a nice increase from the same period in 2011 - Web site leads are up and Find a Doctor searches are up from the same time last year - We also continue to see increasing traffic from mobile device users, with visitors to the Invisalign.com mobile site, now making up around a quarter of our total traffic when our ads are on TV  On-air TV presence - In early Q3 we continued leveraging the peak teen season by running our Twins TV spots to reach moms and teens - This year we were off air for three weeks in July to avoid competition with the Olympics. However, we supplemented our TV presence during those important final summer months with radio, digital, and traditional PR and event marketing, including our second year sponsoring Radio Disneys Next Big Thing Tour, which includes elements of all of those marketing channels, including a lot of Disney radio and TV placements. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved15
 
Scanner and CAD/CAM Services Q3 12 Performance  Scanner and CAD/CAM Services revenues of $9.8M, compared to $11.9M in Q2 12 - Scanner revenues of $4.0M, compared to $6.0M in Q2 12 - CAD/CAM Services revenues of $5.8M, compared to $5.9M in Q2 12  Scanner and CAD/CAM services business sequential decease reflects summer seasonality - In addition, there were no major industry or Invisalign customer events that would give us additional selling opportunities like the AAO meeting in May 2012 and the GP Summit in July 2011. These major tradeshows and customer events like Invisalign Summits provide a unique opportunity to present iTero scanners and close orders. Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved16
 
Termination of Straumann Distributorship Effective December 31, 2012 in Europe and North America Align Technology, Inc. All rights reserved17  Since acquiring Cadent 18 months ago, we have been committed to enabling a digital shift within restorative dentistry, with the iTero scanner as the center of our strategy.  We have worked with Straumann over the past few years to establish a sales, services, and support model for the iTero scanner that would benefit both our companies. The global market for restorative dentistry is far more fragmented and complex than orthodontics with hundreds of thousands of labs, suppliers, general dentists, and specialists. In Europe, adoption of digital restorative technology has been further slowed due to challenging economic conditions and reluctance to invest in capital equipment.  Despite our efforts, our collaboration for distributing iTero scanners is not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. As a result, Align has decided to market iTero on a more limited basis directly in Europe focusing on our existing Invisalign customers and pursue global scanner potential on a more opportunistic basis. We will continue our direct sales of iTero scanners in North America where digital dentistry is evolving more rapidly. Over the past year, weve invested in our scanner business in North America by doubling the number of direct sales representatives and in-office trainers, through ongoing improvements in scanner service and support, and through a robust product and applications development pipeline. Weve demonstrated this business model can work and we are confident we have the best performing scanner in the market.  Both Align and Straumann are committed to ensuring a continued high level of service and support for our existing iTero customers in Europe and North America. Straumann will continue to offer first-level equipment support in Europe for at least the next 12 months, after which full responsibility for regional customer service will transfer to Align. We are currently working together on plans for a smooth transition and will communicate details to customers as soon as they are finalized.

Invisalign ASPs were lower as expected compared to last quarter due to deferrals associated with the Invisalign Teen/Vivera Retainer promotion and headwinds from Foreign Exchange rates. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign revenue growth was driven by volume increases offset somewhat by foreign exchange rates. * * Non-GAAP A reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP can be found at http://investor.aligntech.com under Financial Information > Quarterly Results for each respective quarter.

All rights reserved28 DSOs for the quarter were 70 days, compared to 63 days in Q2 and 62 days in the same quarter last year. The increase in DSO this quarter primarily reflects less shipment linearity in the quarter and a slight slowing of customer payments in September. Overall, our aging remains in solid shape and I expect DSOs to trend lower in Q4. During Q3 12, we purchased approximately 213,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $34.15 per share for a total of approximately $7.3 million. There remains approximately $132.5 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.

Factors That Inform Our View of Q4 2012  We had greater than expected summer seasonality in North America, from both GP dentists and Orthodontists. This softness has persisted into October which resulted in lower case receipts from which Q4 shipments are generated. However, busy sales force activity and patient traffic in October points to renewed growth for the Invisalign business.  Q4 is historically a stronger quarter for international doctors as they come back from summer vacations and we would expect that to be the case this year as well.  Q4 is historically the heaviest buying period for capital equipment purchasers in North America. In order to make the most of this year-end buying cycle, we are offering a promotion of $4,000 off an iTero scanner in Q4. There are also two major events we will be leveraging in Q4, the ADA meeting going on in San Francisco this week and our Invisalign Ortho Summit in November. As a result of these sales and promotional activities, we expect North American scanner sales to increase nicely from Q3. For International, we do not expect any contribution due to the termination of the iTero distribution agreements with Straumann announced today.  Lastly, given the slowdown we have seen recently, we are more cautious about consumer behavior in the near term and their willingness to move forward with higher value procedures like Invisalign.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
SAN JOSE, Calif., December 5, 2012 -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN) today initiated a set of organizational changes to more effectively support business functions along its Clear Aligner and Scanner and CAD/CAM Services product lines. Product and brand marketing veteran Greg Morrow will join Align as vice president and general manager for the Clear Aligner product line, reporting directly to Tim Mack, senior vice president, marketing and business development. Mr. Mack will continue in his current position and take on the additional role of general manager for the Scanner and CAD/CAM Services product line.
"Greg brings a wealth of marketing, brand and business unit management knowledge to Align, with deep experience across many industries and consumer brands, most recently with Johnson & Johnsons Vision Care Division, and prior to that with well-respected brands such as Coca-Cola  and Procter & Gamble. We are excited to have him join the team and to help accelerate growth and adoption of Invisalign worldwide. said Mr. Mack.
In addition, Dana Cambra, vice president, research and development, has left the Company. On an interim basis, Align President and CEO Thomas M. Prescott will oversee R&D and Information Technology.
 Under Danas leadership, the R&D and IT groups have made significant contributions to the success of the Company and we appreciate Danas role in building up those organizations, said Mr. Prescott. Im confident that our very experienced and talented team will continue to drive industry-leading products and clinical innovation for Invisalign and iTero scanner technology.
There will be a small reduction in workforce related to these organizational changes that will impact approximately 25 full time employees across the Company. Align will incur approximately $2.1 million in costs for severance of which $1.9 million will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $0.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Based on this, as well as continued softness in the dental market and the disruption of its customers practices from Superstorm Sandy, Align now expects revenue and EPS to be at the low-end of its previously reported Q412 guidance. As of September 30, 2012 Align had a regular employee base of approximately 3,090 worldwide.

Align Technology Announces Fourth Quarter and Record Fiscal Year 2012 Results
 
 
SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwire - January 30, 2013) - Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: )
ALGN
 
 
Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
ALGN
 
Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (Q4 12) were $142.8 million. This is compared to $136.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2012 (Q3 12) and compared to $128.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011 (Q4 11). Q4 12 net revenues include the release of $4.9 million of revenue previously deferred for Invisalign case refinement. Q4 12 Invisalign clear aligner revenue was $132.8 million, compared to $126.7 million in Q3 12 and $118.9 million in Q4 11. Q4 12 Invisalign clear aligner case shipments were 90.5 thousand, compared to 92.5 thousand in Q3 12 and 82.6 thousand in Q4 11. Q4 12 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue was $10.0 million, compared to $9.8 million in Q3 12 and compared to $10.0 million in Q4 11.
 
Align defers revenue for Invisalign case refinement, which is an optional finishing tool used to adjust a patient's teeth to the desired final position that is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment. In Q4 12, we determined that the actual usage rate was lower than our estimate and as a result we released $4.9 million of revenue deferred for case refinement.
 
For fiscal 2012 (FY 12), record net revenues of $560.0 million increased 16.7 percent from $479.7 million reported for fiscal 2011 (FY 11). Record FY 12 Invisalign clear aligner net revenues of $516.6 million increased 14.4% from $451.7 million reported for FY 11. FY 12 Invisalign clear aligner case shipments of 363.5 thousand increased 17.5% from 309.3 thousand reported for FY 11. FY 12 scanner and CAD/CAM services net revenues was $43.4 million compared to $28.0 million in FY 11. FY 11 scanner and CAD/CAM services net revenues reflect eight months of sales resulting from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., which closed on April 29, 2011.
 
 
 
 
Im very pleased to report a solid fourth quarter which culminated in a record fiscal year for with over 17 percent growth for Invisalign volume, said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. Despite a soft start this quarter in North America for Align and most of the dental industry, Invisalign case submissions rebounded in December and this trend has continued into the first quarter of 2013.  Overall, weve seen an uptick in North American case receipts -- reflecting increased patient traffic in our customers offices, as well as traction from customer engagement and practice development activities. Weve also seen increased customer interest in Invisalign related to the launch of SmartTrack, our next generation aligner material which is commercially available now.  Prescott continued, We had many significant accomplishments in 2012 that contributed to our growth, including entry into new market segments with the launch of Invisalign Express 5 and Invisalign i7 and expansion into new emerging country markets.  We are starting off the new year with several new products and feature enhancements including the new iTero scanner, Invisalign Outcome Simulator, and Invisalign G4 enhancements which will contribute to our growth throughout the year.
 
Net profit for Q4 12 of $9.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, includes the release of $4.9 million of revenue previously deferred for Invisalign case refinement. This is compared to net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.00 per diluted share in Q3 12 and net profit of $20.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in Q4 11. Net profit for Q4 12 includes a goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million resulting from finalizing our Q3 12 preliminary estimate and a pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.0 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $0.2 million. Net loss for Q3 12 includes a preliminary estimate pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $24.7 million, pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.2 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.1 million with a total income tax-related adjustment of $2.1 million. Net profit for Q4 11 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $1.1 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.3 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.8 million with a total tax effect of $0.7 million.
 
In Q3 12, we determined that there were sufficient indicators of a potential impairment to the goodwill attributed to the scanner and CAD/CAM services reporting unit, therefore we conducted step one of the goodwill impairment analysis and concluded that the goodwill was impaired. Based on our preliminary step two analysis, we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $24.7 million in Q3 12. In Q4 12, we finalized step two of our analysis and recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million.
 
Net profit for FY 12 was $58.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share and includes pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $36.6 million, pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $1.3 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $4.4 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.8 million with a total tax effect of $4.9 million. This compares to net profit for FY 11 of $66.7 million, or $0.83 per diluted share and includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $10.0 million, pre-tax amortization of acquired intangible assets of $3.2 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $1.1 million with a total tax effect of $2.9 million.
 
 
 
 
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release.
 
Non-GAAP net profit for Q4 12 was $22.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $23.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in Q3 12 and non-GAAP net profit of $23.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in Q4 11. Non-GAAP net profit for FY 12 was $96.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net profit for FY 11 of $78.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q4 12 was $6.0 million compared to $5.4 million in Q3 12 and $5.0 million in Q4 11. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q4 12, Q3 12 and Q4 11 was $0.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q4 12 was $5.5 million compared to $4.9 million in Q3 12 and $4.5 million in Q4 11.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2012, Align Technology had $356.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $248.1 million as of December 31, 2011. During Q4 12, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.41 per share for a total of approximately $37.0 million. There remains approximately $95.5 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.
 
Q1 Fiscal 2013 Business Outlook
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (Q1 13), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $146.0 million to $150.5 million. Invisalign clear aligner case shipments for Q1 13 are expected to be in a range of 95.0 to 97.5 thousand cases, which reflect a year-over-year increase of 11.4% to 14.3%. Earnings per diluted share for Q1 13 is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23. Starting in fiscal year 2013, amortization of acquired intangible assets will no longer be excluded as a non-GAAP measure. The expense is now included in all periods presented, therefore, excluding it as a non-GAAP measure is no longer in period-to-period comparisons. A more comprehensive business outlook is available following the financial tables of this release.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, severance and benefit costs, impairment of goodwill, and any related income tax-related adjustments, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance." Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
 
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the first quarter of 2013, including anticipated net revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Cadent Holdings, Inc., continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, the loss of key personnel and impairments in the book value of goodwill or other intangible assets. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.
 
(2) Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When conducting internal development of intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, etc.), GAAP accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges for our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.
 
(3) Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and were realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand significant severance and benefits costs and, we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
 
(4) Impairment of goodwill. This cost represents non-cash write-downs of our goodwill. During the third quarter of 2012, we determined that there were sufficient indicators such as the termination of our distribution agreement with Straumann for iTero intra-oral scanners as well as the market conditions and business trends within our Scanners and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit for an impairment of goodwill. We remove the impact of these charges to our operating performance to assist in assessing our ability to generate cash from operations. We believe this may be useful information to users of our financial statements and therefore we have excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.
 
(5) Income tax-related adjustments. Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to our annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for discrete tax items and items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be re-calculated during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate.
 
(6) Includes the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
 
(7) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use EBITDA as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the medical technology industry. We also use adjusted EBITDA which excludes certain special or non-recurring expenses, net of certain special or non-recurring benefits, detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, as an internal measure of business operating performance. We believe such financial measures provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance to our current business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA and similarly titled financial measures in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating or net profit.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
Credit Agreement
    
On
March 22, 2013
, Align Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the 
Company
), entered into a Credit Agreement (the 
Credit Agreement
) between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender (the 
Lender
).
The Credit Agreement provides for a $50 million revolving credit facility, with a $10 million letter of credit sublimit, terminating on
March 22, 2016
(the 
Maturity Date
). Proceeds of loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. No loans were made nor letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement at closing.
The loans bear interest, at the Company's option, at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the daily one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate (based on one, three, six or twelve-month interest periods) plus a spread of 1.75%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
Interest is due and payable in arrears monthly for all loans. Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Company may terminate all outstanding commitments at any time without premium or penalty, and prepay loans in whole or in part, in each case subject to certain conditions.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, guarantee obligations, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to maintain compliance with a quick ratio, a positive net income after taxes and a minimum deposit with the Agent or its affiliates, and to limit its annual capital expenditures.
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness and material agreements, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgment defaults and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes hereof, 
Liquidity
 means cash, Cash Equivalents (as defined in clause (d) of Loans, Advances, Investments below), investments permitted in clause (e) of Loans, Advances, Investments below, and/or publicly traded/quoted marketable securities acceptable to Bank in its sole discretion, free of any lien or other encumbrance other than Permitted Liens.

ARBITRATION.
1.
Arbitration
. The parties hereto agree, upon demand by any party, whether made before the institution of a judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim, counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise, in any way arising out of or relating to (a) any credit subject hereto, or any of the Loan Documents, and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination; or (b) requests for additional credit. In the event of a court ordered arbitration, the party requesting arbitration shall be responsible for timely filing the demand for arbitration and paying the appropriate filing fee within 30 days of the abatement order or the time specified by the court. Failure to timely file the demand for arbitration as ordered by the court will result in that party's right to demand arbitration being automatically terminated.
2.
Governing Rules
. Any arbitration proceeding will (a) proceed in a location in California selected by the American Arbitration Association ("
AAA
"); (b) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (c) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA's commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA's optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to herein, as applicable, as the "
Rules
"). If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. 91 or any similar applicable state law.
3.
No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure
. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any party to (a) foreclose against real or personal property collateral; (b) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (c) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in sections (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph.
4.
Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers
. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00
or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of California with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator's discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of California and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the California Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief.
5.
Discovery
. In any arbitration proceeding, discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the party's presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available.
6.
Class Proceedings and Consolidations
. No party hereto shall be entitled to join or consolidate disputes by or against others in any arbitration, except parties who have executed any of the Loan Documents, or to include in any arbitration any dispute as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.
7.
Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees
. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding.
8.
Real Property Collateral; Judicial Reference
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no dispute shall be submitted to arbitration if the dispute concerns indebtedness secured directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by any real property unless (a) the holder of the mortgage, lien or security interest specifically elects in writing to proceed with the arbitration, or (b) all parties to the arbitration waive any rights or benefits that might accrue to them by virtue of the single action rule statute of California, thereby agreeing that all indebtedness and obligations of the parties, and all mortgages, liens and security interests securing such indebtedness and obligations, shall remain fully valid and enforceable. If any such dispute is not submitted to arbitration, the dispute shall be referred to a referee in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 et seq., and this general reference agreement is intended to be specifically enforceable in accordance with said Section 638. A referee with the qualifications required herein for arbitrators shall be selected pursuant to the AAA's selection procedures. Judgment upon the decision rendered by a referee shall be entered in the court in which such proceeding was commenced in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645.
9.
Miscellaneous
. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a party required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the parties potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the documents between the parties or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in writing signed by each party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or any remaining provisions of this Agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the documents or any relationship between the parties.
10.
Small Claims Court
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party retains the right to pursue in Small Claims Court any dispute within that court's jurisdiction. Further, this arbitration provision shall apply only to disputes in which either party seeks to recover an amount of money (excluding attorneys' fees and costs) that exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first written above.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Align Technology Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Results
 
SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - April 18, 2013) - Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: )
ALGN
 
 
Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
ALGN
 
Total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (Q1 13) were $153.6 million. This is compared to $142.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2012 (Q4 12) and compared to $135.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2012 (Q1 12). Q1 13 Invisalign clear aligner revenue was $141.6 million, compared to $132.8 million in Q4 12 and $123.3 million in Q1 12. As expected, Q1 13 clear aligner revenue includes $4.4 million from the planned consolidation of Vivera Retainer product shipments from four shipments per year down to one shipment per year, as well as a $2.7 million decrease in revenue due to the change in our mid-course correction policy effective June 15, 2013. Q1 13 Invisalign clear aligner case shipments were 98.2 thousand, compared to 90.5 thousand in Q4 12 and 85.3 thousand in Q1 12. Q1 13 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue was $12.0 million, compared to $10.0 million in Q4 12 and compared to $11.8 million in Q1 12. Q1 13 scanner and CAD/CAM services revenue includes $1.4 million that was deferred in Q3 and Q4 2012 for the new iTero scanner upgrade program which was launched in Q1 13.
 
Recent changes in the competitive environment for intra-oral scanners including announcements in March 2013 of new low-priced scanners targeted at Orthodontists and GP Dentists in North America caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner and CAD/CAM services business during Q1 13.  As a result, we conducted an impairment analysis of long-lived assets and goodwill related to our scanner and CAD/CAM services reporting unit. Based on these analyses, we recorded a $26.3 million impairment of our long-lived assets and a $40.7 million impairment of goodwill. The $40.7 million represents the remaining goodwill balance in the scanner and CAD/CAM services reporting unit.
 
 
 
 
 
Q1 was a solid quarter across the board. Weve started the year with better than expected revenue and non-GAAP earnings driven primarily by record Invisalign case volume. Strong Invisalign case shipments in North America, especially among Orthodontists, reflect stable patient traffic in our customers offices as well as continued activity to encourage doctor engagement, said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. Although we determined it was appropriate to record the impairment charges related to the scanner and CAD/CAM services unit, our long term view of this business remains positive and we will continue to execute plans to be a leader in this business.  In addition, we continue to see leverage in the Invisalign business from scanner technology and maintain our belief in the long term benefits of the scanner and CAD/CAM services business.
 
Net loss for Q1 13 was $42.0 million, or $(0.52) per diluted share. This is compared to net profit of $9.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in Q4 12 and net profit of $21.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in Q1 12. Net profit for Q1 13 includes an impairment of long-lived assets of $26.3 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $40.7 million. Net profit for Q4 12 includes a goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million resulting from finalizing our Q3 12 preliminary estimate. Net profit for Q1 12 includes pre-tax acquisition and integration related costs of $0.7 million, pre-tax severance and benefit costs of $0.5 million with a total tax effect of $0.6 million.
 
Prescott continued, "During the quarter we launched SmartTrack, our next generation aligner material, which is now the standard aligner material for Invisalign clear aligners worldwide. We have received consistently positive initial feedback from our customers and their patients. We're excited about the potential for SmartTrack material to help doctors increase confidence in using Invisalign more often and for more complex cases due to the improved control of tooth movements and the added benefit of increased patient comfort. We are committed to improving the Invisalign customer experience by continually evaluating and striving to improve our products, customer support processes, and policies to help doctors achieve the best results for their patients."
 
As previously disclosed, beginning in Q1 13, Align began consolidating Vivera Retainer shipments down to one shipment per year instead of four shipments per year. As a result, the full amount of Vivera Retainer revenue is now recognized upon shipment rather than ratably over four quarters. For Q1 13 clear aligner revenue includes $4.4 million from consolidating Vivera Retainer product shipments. This shipment change was based on feedback from our customers that it would make their practices more efficient.
 
Beginning June 15, 2013, Align will no longer charge a fee associated with mid-course correction orders. Mid-course correction provides Invisalign customers with the option of ordering a treatment adjustment during active treatment if the case is not tracking to the original treatment plan or goals, giving doctors the ability to adjust course based on the needs of the individual patient. As of June 15, Align will include up to three free mid-course correction orders per case in our list prices for Invisalign Full and Invisalign Teen. As a result, Invisalign clear aligner revenues for Q1 13 were decreased by $2.7 million, representing the revenue deferred to provide free mid-course corrections for open cases that we expect to be eligible for this new policy when it is implemented.
 
 
 
 
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net profit, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Detailed reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables following the financial tables of this release. Starting in fiscal year 2013, amortization of acquired intangible assets is no longer excluded as a non-GAAP measure. This expense is included in GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, profit (loss) from operations and net profit (loss) for the periods presented below and therefore is no longer a reconciling item.
 
Non-GAAP net profit for Q1 13 was $21.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. This is compared to non-GAAP net profit of $21.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in Q4 12 and non-GAAP net profit of $21.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in Q1 12.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total stock-based compensation expense included in Q1 13 was $6.4 million compared to $6.0 million in Q4 12 and $4.9 million in Q1 12. Stock based compensation expense included in GAAP gross margin in Q1 13 was $0.6 million, and Q4 12 and Q1 12 was $0.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense included in GAAP operating expense in Q1 13 was $5.8 million compared to $5.5 million in Q4 12 and $4.4 million in Q1 12.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2013, Align Technology had $377.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $356.1 million as of December 31, 2012. During Q1 13, we purchased approximately 75 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $32.47 per share for a total of approximately $2.4 million. There remains approximately $92.7 million available under the Company's existing stock repurchase authorization.
 
Q2 Fiscal 2013 Business Outlook
For the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (Q2 13), Align Technology expects net revenues to be in a range of $153.6 million to $157.4 million. Invisalign clear aligner case shipments for Q2 13 are expected to be in a range of 102.2 to 104.7 thousand cases, which reflect a year-over-year increase of 7.2% to 9.8%. Earnings per diluted share for Q2 13 is expected to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.28.

About non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements and our business outlook, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP profit from operations, non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude, as applicable, acquisition and integration related costs, severance and benefit costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets and any related income tax-related adjustments, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our "core operating performance". Management believes that "core operating performance" represents Align's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" certain expenditures and other items that may not be indicative of our operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges that are infrequent or one-time in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to facilitate comparisons with prior and subsequent reporting periods. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and year and a more detailed explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and its uses are provided in the footnotes to the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics" and "Business Outlook Summary" included at the end of this release.
 
Forward-Looking Statement
This news release, including the tables below, contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding certain business metrics for the second quarter of 2013, including anticipated net revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, case shipments and cash. Forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the tables below relating to expectations about future events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, difficulties predicting customer and consumer purchasing behavior, the willingness and ability of our customers to maintain and/or increase utilization in sufficient numbers, the possibility that the development and release of new products does not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline, the possibility that the market for the sale of these new products may not develop as expected, the risks relating to Align's ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods while controlling expenses, growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel, our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated benefits from the scanner and the CAD/CAM services business, continued customer demand for our existing and new products, changes in consumer spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages and consumer confidence, the timing of case submissions from our doctors within a quarter, acceptance of our products by consumers and dental professionals, foreign operational, political and other risks relating to Align's international manufacturing operations, Align's ability to protect its intellectual property rights, continued compliance with regulatory requirements, competition from existing and new competitors, Align's ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements, the loss of key personnel and impairments in the book value of goodwill or other intangible assets. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in Align's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2013. Align undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting in fiscal year 2013, amortization of acquired intangible assets is no longer excluded as a non-GAAP measure. This expense is included in GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, profit (loss) from operations and net profit (loss) for the periods presented below and therefore is no longer a reconciling item.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Acquisition costs and integration related. We have incurred acquisition-related and other expenses which include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties, retention bonuses, integration and professional fees. We do not engage in acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful because we generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.
 
(2) Severance and benefits costs. These costs are related to the closure of our New Jersey operations and were realized through the first three quarters of 2012. We have engaged in various restructuring and exit activities in 2011 and 2009 that have resulted in costs associated with severance and benefits. Such activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring and/or exit activities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that it is important to understand significant severance and benefits costs from restructuring and exit activities and believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
 
(3) Impairment of goodwill. Tcurrent operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.
hese costs represent non-cash write-downs of our goodwill generally related to negative trends in market and economic conditions, termination of relationships with distributors, or the increase in completive environment related to our Scanner and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit. We remove the impact of these charges to our operating performance to assist in assessing our ability to generate cash from operations. We believe this may be useful information to users of our financial statements and therefore we have excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our
 
(4) Impairment of long-lived assets. Tcurrent operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.
hese costs represent non-cash write-downs of our long-lived assets generally related to the increase in completive environment related to our Scanner and CAD/CAM Services reporting unit. As a result of these conditions, we have assessed that our asset group within the reporting unit was not recoverable and therefore recorded an impairment charge. We remove the impact of these charges to our operating performance to assist in assessing our ability to generate cash from operations. We believe this may be useful information to users of our financial statements and therefore we have excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our
 
(5) Income tax-related adjustments. Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to our annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for discrete tax items and items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be re-calculated during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate.
 
(6) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use EBITDA as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the medical technology industry. We also use adjusted EBITDA which excludes certain special or non-recurring expenses, net of certain special or non-recurring benefits, detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, as an internal measure of business operating performance. We believe such financial measures provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance to our current business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA and similarly titled financial measures in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating or net profit.
