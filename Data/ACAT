 - 
Diluted EPS up 21 percent to $1.45 in fiscal 2003
                 
 - 
Full-year net sales up 4 percent to $577.1 million
                 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., May 15  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported record net sales of $577.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, versus $556.1 million last fiscal year. Net earnings grew 14 percent to $32.7 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $28.6 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for fiscal 2002.  Fiscal 2003 results included the third-quarter net reduction of restructuring accruals related to Arctic Cat's exit from the personal watercraft (PWC) business in September 1999. Excluding non-recurring items, net sales in fiscal 2003 rose 3 percent to $573.1 million, net earnings increased 2 percent to $29.3 million, and diluted earnings per share grew 8 percent to $1.30.
 
In the 2003 fourth quarter, net sales increased 12 percent to $111.4 million versus $99.3 million in the same period last year. The company reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
 
"We are pleased to report another year of record sales and increased earnings, driven by growing sales of Arctic Cat ATVs," said Christopher A. Twomey, president and chief executive officer. "In addition, sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles fared better than the industry overall, as we gained market share during a difficult snowmobile season with poor snow in the Midwest.  In fact, our North American dealers ended the year with lower snowmobile inventory levels than last year despite the challenging snow conditions. Contributing to our success, Arctic Cat's new Firecat snowmobile, which set new design and engineering standards, became the industry's number-one selling sled."
 
During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 62,000 shares of its common stock, bringing the total shares repurchased in fiscal 2003 to 1.5 million. Since 1996, Arctic Cat has repurchased more than 8 million shares under four share repurchase authorizations. The
company has approximately one million additional shares remaining under its current repurchase authorization.
 
Business Line Results
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) grew 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $82.7 million versus $72.6 million in the same period last year. For fiscal 2003, ATV sales rose 13 percent to $235.9 million.
 
"We are particularly pleased with the success of our Multi-Rack Platform (MRP) ATV, which was named the ATV Product Innovation of the Year' by ," said Twomey. The MRP model enables users to adapt their ATVs to a wide range of applications by attaching up to 24 different, interchangeable accessories on the vehicle's front and rear racks for work and recreation.
ATV Magazine
 
Since entering the ATV market in 1996, Arctic Cat's ATV sales have rapidly grown to 41 percent of the company's revenues, leveraging its year-round production capacity and large dealer network. By offering best-in class ATVs, Arctic Cat's sales have continually outpaced the industry's growth rate.
 
Snowmobile sales in the 2003 fourth quarter totaled $1.5 million versus $3.3 million in the prior-year quarter, due to increased sales incentives related to poor snow conditions across much of the Midwest. Arctic Cat's full-year wholesale sales were down 5 percent to $245.2 million, performing better than the anticipated 7 to 10 percent decline. The company's full-year retail snowmobile sales also fell by 5 percent, representing less than half of the industry's retail sales decline, as the company gained market share.
 
Arctic Cat offers a complete line of snowmobile models including high performance, mountain, family sport, touring and utility. The company's build-to-order method of manufacturing and emphasis on pre-season snowmobile sales enables Arctic Cat to minimize seasonal carryover inventory.
 
Sales of parts, garments, and accessories grew 16 percent to $27.2 million in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, sales of parts, garments and accessories increased 3 percent to $92.0 million, due to increased sales of ATV-related parts and accessories.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat anticipates 2004 first-quarter net sales for the period ending June 30, 2003, will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million, compared to $78.3 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated between breakeven to a loss of 6 cents per diluted share versus earnings of 8 cents per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The first
quarter's results will be lower than last year's first quarter due to fewer snowmobiles in the sales mix.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will grow 3 to 5 percent and be in the range of $590 million to $602 million. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.41. Due to the seasonal nature of Arctic Cat's snowmobile and ATV products, the company sells the majority of its products during its second and third fiscal quarters.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
      Sales and Earnings At High End of Guidance
 - 
      ATV Sales Increased 53%
 - 
      Company Unveils New ATVs, Offers Extensive Model Line-up
 - 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., July 17  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $77.2 million for the fiscal 2004 first quarter ended June 30, 2003, versus $78.3 million in the same period last year. The net earnings for the quarter were $102,000, or 0 cents per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $1.97 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
 
"Our financial results were in line with our earlier guidance, anticipating lower sales and earnings due to fewer snowmobiles in our first-quarter sales mix," said Christopher A. Twomey, president and chief executive officer. "For the year, we remain on track to achieve net sales growth of 2 to 4 percent, driven by increased ATV sales."
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) grew to $31.5 million from $20.6 million in the prior-year period, a year-over-year increase of 53 percent.
 
"Arctic Cat is becoming an ATV company that also produces snowmobiles," Twomey said. "In fiscal 2004, we expect to produce more ATVs than snowmobiles and, significantly, ATV unit revenues will exceed that of snowmobiles for the first time in our company's history. We're proud to offer the most extensive and complete ATV line currently available."
 
The company unveiled its new model line-up to dealers in June, introducing eight new models, four new engines, 14 major technology enhancements and more unique packages for the award-winning MultiRack Platform (MRP) ATV, which was named "2003 Product Innovation of the Year" by . This expands Arctic Cat's offerings to more than 25 ATV models in its 2004 line-up.
ATV Magazine
 
New ATVs introduced in June include Arctic Cat's most powerful ATV yet, with a 650cc V-Twin engine. The company also entered the sport performance ATV segment with a 400cc DVX model featuring removable fenders. The 400 class ATV is the largest segment of the sports performance category, making this an important market entry. The company also launched two new youth models.
 
For the popular MRP ATV, Arctic Cat more than doubled the number of accessory attachments to over 40, and created nine customized accessory packages aimed at specific applications, including construction, ranching, fishing, camping, landscaping and hunting.
 
"Building on Arctic Cat's tradition of innovation, we also are pleased to be the first manufacturer to offer integrated shelters on our ATVs," Twomey said. Called "Rapid" packages designed for select MRP models, these tent-like shelters attach to the front and rear ATV racks and can be quickly deployed, comfortably enclosing the ATV and up to two people. "Rapid" packages include a fishing shelter for ice fishing, as well as a hunting blind on the big game and waterfowl packages.
 
Sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles totaled $34.8 million in the 2004 first quarter versus $47.0 million in the comparable period last year. The lower sales comparison is primarily due to a change in the timing of shipments to dealers, in order to align snowmobile shipments with retail sales during Arctic Cat's second and third fiscal quarters. For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, the company anticipates that its snowmobile revenues will decline approximately 2 percent to 3 percent versus last year, as a result of conservative ordering by Midwest dealers following several consecutive seasons of poor snow conditions.
 
"This is particularly disappointing given the extensive changes in our exciting 2004 snowmobile line-up," Twomey said.
 
Parts, garments and accessories sales rose 3 percent to $10.9 million, up from $10.6 million in the prior-year period.
 
During the first quarter, the company repurchased 232,500 shares of its common stock under its current share repurchase authorization. The company has approximately 750,000 shares remaining under this authorization.
 
Outlook
 
$211.2 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated between 94 cents to 97 cents per diluted share versus earnings of 91 cents per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
Arctic Cat anticipates 2004 second-quarter net sales for the period ending September 30, 2003, in the range of $216 million to $220 million, compared to
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will grow 2 to 4 percent and be in the range of $590 million to $602 million. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.41. Due to the seasonal nature of Arctic Cat's snowmobile and ATV products, the company sells the majority of its products during its second and third fiscal quarters.

TRANSCRIPT
 
Operator
 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Arctic Cat first-quarter 2004 earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 17, 2003. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Shawn Brumbaugh.
 
SHAWN BRUMBAUGH
- Padilla Speer Beardsley - Host
 
Thank you. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm Shawn Brumbaugh with Padilla Speer Beardsley. Chris Twomey, Chief Executive Officer of Arctic Cat, will be leading our call today. Also with us this morning is Tim Delmore, Arctic Cat's Chief Financial Officer.
 
You should have received a copy of the release reporting results for the first quarter ended June 30, 2003. Chris will take a few minutes to talk about the highlights of the past three months and then Tim will take you through the financials.
 
I must preface all comments with a Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ and factors that may cause such results to differ are identified in the Company's report on Form 10-K. Now, I'll turn the call over to Arctic Cat's CEO, Chris Twomey.
 
CHRIS TWOMEY
- Arctic Cat - CEO
 
Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We are pleased that our sales and earnings for the quarter are in line with our earlier guidance. For the year, we expect our sales to outpace last year's record-breaking levels. For the quarter, sales of ATVs were up 53 percent and parts, garments and accessories were also up three percent. Sales of our snowmobiles were down over last year, as we've moved shipments into the second and third quarter to better match the retail season for this product. By year-end, we expect sales of snowmobiles to be down two to three percent compared to last year, largely as a result of the poor snow for a number of years in the Midwest. While this small decline might be less than other snowmobile companies may be reporting, it is still disappointing given the new models and product innovations which we introduced this year. Again, we believe that the decline is definitely snow-related. In areas of the country where we experienced good snow last year, retail sales were strong and dealer orders were up nicely for this model year. When the snow returns to the Midwest this year, we expect to see nice increases in wholesale sales for the 05 model year.
In mid-June, we completed our 2004 ATV Dealer Show, where we introduced eight new models, four new engines and 14 technological enhancements. The two most significant models introduced were, first, the new sport utility model, which utilizes a new 650 V-Twin engine. This model should significantly enhance our sales in the large displacement sport utility category. In addition, we entered the sport performance ATV market with a 400 DVX model. This sport performance segment accounts for approximately 20 percent of the overall ATV market and until now, we have not participated in this segment. This new model, which features great performance and styling, should help us capture our share of the sport performance market. The 650 sport utility market model will begin shipping at the end of the second quarter, and the sport performance model will ship in the third quarter. In addition to these new engines, new models and new technologies, we've also significantly enhanced the number of parts and accessories for our ATV lineup in order to improve our PG&A sales and profits, as well as those of our dealers.
 
In terms of full-year performance, again, we expect snowmobile sales to be down two to three percent, directly related to the poor snow which we experienced in the Midwest. We expect parts, garments and accessories sales to increase in the three to four percent range, and we expect ATV sales to be up ten percent for the year. Overall, we expect a two to three percent sales growth and an eight percent EPS growth for the year.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Tim and have him comment on the numbers and then be happy to answer any questions that you have. Tim?
 
TIM DELMORE
 - Arctic Cat - CFO
 
Good Morning. I would also like to welcome you to the conference call. Today, I'll focus on reviewing highlights of our first-quarter financial performance, as well as our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Net sales for the first quarter were $77.2 million versus $78.3 million for the first quarter last year. A 53 percent, or $10.9 million increase in ATV sales, and a three percent increase in parts, garments and accessories sales offset a planned decrease in first-quarter snowmobile shipments. Gross profits for the quarter were $18.5 million versus $18.8 million. The gross profit percentage for the quarter was 24 percent, essentially the same as the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million to $18.6 million, mainly due to increased ATV and other marketing expenses. Our interest income was down to $249,000 versus $378,000 for the same quarter a year ago, due to lower yields on investment related to lower interest rates. Net income was $102,000, versus a net income of $1.97 million for the first-quarter last year, and diluted earnings per share were zero cents, versus eight cents per share a year ago.
 
We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $21 million in cash and no debt. Inventories were up due to the increased level of production this July versus last July  increased our richer finished-unit model mix, as well as a few increased units for in-house testing and marketing. Current liabilities were down seven million, due to the reduction of the personal watercraft exit accrual we recorded in last year's December quarter. We repurchased approximately 233,000 shares this quarter, and we have approximately 750,000 shares remaining on our current authorization. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $3.9 million and depreciation was $3.8 million. We expect full-year 2004 capital expenditures to total approximately $27 million and depreciation to be approximately $16 million.
 
Looking ahead to full-year fiscal 2004, we are continuing to target an eight percent increase in earnings per share to the $1.39 to $1.41 range, versus the $1.30 adjusted EPS for last year. We expect our full year sales to be in the $590 to $602 million range. We continue, as Chris said, to anticipate ATV sales to grow 10  percent, our PG&A business to grow about four percent, and snowmobile sales to decrease about two percent. Arctic Cat anticipates that the 2004 second-quarter net sales to be in the $216 million to $220 million range, compared to $211.2 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be 94 to 97 cents per share, compared to 91 cents for the same quarter last year. Thank you. Margarita, we would now like to open it up for questions.

Good morning, guys. Three questions for you first, I was little bit surprised to see you were able to keep your gross margins flat in light of the mix shift away from snowmobiles and the increased promotions in ATVs. I was wondering if you could comment on that. Then second, you had mentioned on your last conference call that you're going to be increasing your ATV promotions. I was just wondering if you could talk about what retail trends you've seen since you made that change. Finally, you had some more ATV shipments this quarter than we were modeling. I'm assuming those are all 03 products. I'm just wondering if you could comment on dealer inventories.
 
TIM DELMORE
- Arctic Cat - CFO
 
I will take the first one regarding the margin. Yes, we had a good overall margin this quarter, despite the fewer snowmobiles in the mix. That was in part because we had higher-margin ATVs in the mix that helped replace that snowmobile margin and also higher service parts/sales in the mix  or parts, garments and accessory
sales in the mix that carry even higher margins than snowmobiles or ATVs.
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
In terms of the effects of ATV programs on sales, we are pleased with our retail sales through the May/June month. We see a bump over the prior year. You know, there's always a question of whether it was a result of the programs or a result of the consumer confidence coming back and the war issues being mostly resolved in that time frame. But in general, we think that, obviously, that the kind of incentives that we worked out  which were not any different than anybody else was doing but just as competitive  had some impact on sales. We've seen a nice rebound in the sales for both May and June for ourselves. What was the last question?
 
ED AARON  RBC CAPITAL MARKETS
 
It was just the ATV shipments came out a little higher than we were looking for this quarter. I just wanted to know about retail inventories.
 
CHRIS TWOMEY
- Arctic Cat - CEO
 
Retail inventories are up a little over last year  not very much, but there's a number of new models  not the 650 and the 400, because again those would be shipped in the second and third quarter; we've got a number of our  most notably probably is our TRV, or our two-rider vehicle, which we just introduced in Q1  started shipping at the end of Q4 and into Q1 of this year. So, some of those kind of new models have added to a little to inventory, but we generally feel comfortable with the inventory at our dealers right now.
 
ED AARON  RBC CAPITAL MARKETS
 
Going back to the May and June sales trend, do you think that you gained market share in those months?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
A little share, yes.

BOB EVANS  CRAIG-HALLUM
 
Good morning. Just to follow up  on the ATV market, are you seeing much on competitive pressures, or has the promotional landscape changed much from last quarter from your competitors? Or what are you seeing on a promotional standpoint?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY
- Arctic Cat - CEO
 
We haven't seen much change in the promotional pressure in that business. As we commented before, it definitely picked up in the beginning part of this year, but I think that was reflective of  again, of the economic uncertainties with war and consumer confidence. You know, we are out with our 04 programs, and our 04 programs, just like our 04 models, our 04 programs are little better than our 03 programs. Most of the other companies will come out in the next month or so and we think that they will all be competitive  not up much over last year, but a little better than last year, and we priced them into our model.

JOE HOVORKA  RAYMOND JAMES
 
Thank you. A couple of questions  actually first, you said May/June trends were good at retail for ATVs. What does July look like so far?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
July is about  well, we've got about a week and a half in July and it's about flat with  for us, it's about flat with last year. But again, we expect that to be that way because we're just shipping. Most of the products that went to the dealers went out in the end of June, so you wouldn't expect to see those registered in the early July kind of time frame, so they are about where we expected to be and about flat with last year.
 
JOE HOVORKA  RAYMOND JAMES
 
Okay. In the quarter, the SG&A line was up I think more than 300 basis points as a percentage of revenue. What's driving that? And is that going to be the trend for the rest of the year, or will it be different for the rest of the year?
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
Just generally, Joe, we expect the SG&A to track in line with the revenue line item. Again, in the first quarter, we had higher planned ATV and other marketing expenses.
 
JOE HOVORKA  RAYMOND JAMES
 
You don't expect those expenses in the last three quarters, or you do?
 
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
Again, I think, we plan, overall, our SG&A will be in line with our revenue increase. You know, we are saying a .

So the percentage of revenue would be even for the last three months or the last three quarters of the year with the year ago numbers?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
Yes, and the overall number for the year  there might be some slight timing differences but again, where we plan to be at the end of the year is the operating expense increase will be in line with our revenue increase.
 
JOE HOVORKA  RAYMOND JAMES
 
Okay, for the full year?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
For the full year, correct.
 
JOE HOVORKA  RAYMOND JAMES
 
So that would imply that the last three quarters would probably be down since the SG&A grew faster than revenue in the first quarter?
 
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
Yes, on a percentage basis.

Just one follow-up question for you  I was just wondering if you could talk about the orders for the 04 model year products and how those compare to your expectations.
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
Ed, the 04 orders were right on our expectations. You know, our plan is to be up for the year, and so our order plan was up and we are on  we're just finishing the orders but coming out of the show, we were better than we had anticipated and we've got to finish those up in the next week or ten days here. Our guys are confident, based on everything we're seeing, that we're going to finish as strong as we came out of the show. You know, again, we've got a lot of new product, two exciting products in the 650 in the sport utility segment and really, what's significant about that is that the 650 segment, or the large-displacement segment, which we categorize as anything above 500cc, has been growing very quickly, and it's a growing segment in the ATV market. In that segment, units with engines above 600cc have been growing more quickly. That's been the growth in that segment and we haven't been there, so we expect, in the end of Q2 and this beginning of Q3, to start seeing those 650cc units registered.
 
Also, the 400 segment  as we look at the market and divide it up by cc, the 400cc segment is another growing part of that market. And we are already outperforming that segment. We haven't been in the sport performance area, and this 400cc DVX model let's us get into that segment, so we expect to see a good retail activity on those once we start getting them into our dealers, which will be, again, the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter.

Hi, guys. A couple of questions for you  I wanted to see if you guys could maybe tell us how much market share you think you've taken in the quarter. I think you and Polaris had some very strong numbers on ATVs, and if you look at the registration numbers from MIC up  I don't know, for the quarter up 3.7 percent or something. Clearly, somebody has to be really being hurt by you guys and losing share for you guys to be up so much in the quarter. Can you explain that phenomenon? Maybe also if you could give us some color on your growth? How much is dollar versus unit going at a higher average price this year than last year?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
You know, somebody is losing a little share; somebody is losing share in the market. We are gaining a little, but not a tremendous  you know, not 50  not the way that the wholesale numbers flow-through. You've got to remember, the wholesale numbers units were units shipped really in the month of June, so we're not going to see those registering until July  you know, the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year. So in general, we are shipping more, we are selling a few more than last year, and the industry is up a bit. We are up a little better than the industry, so we are taking some share, and that's got to be coming from somebody, but .
 
CHUCK WALTIER  TRENTON CAPITAL
 
You don't who?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY 
Arctic Cat CEO
 
No.
 
CHUCK WALTIER  TRENTON CAPITAL
 
There aren't many participants in this market. Maybe you guys could touch on any of them that are losing share. I understand that several of the Japanese competitors are pretty price-competitive right now. Maybe I didn't phrase the first question correctly. April, May and June combined registrations were up about 3.7 percent. You guys had ATV revenues up 50 some-odd percent. Polaris was up in the 20s. There seems to be just a little bit of a disconnect. Clearly, you don't have nearly the inventory growth that Polaris has. I'm just getting the sense that there's more dealer inventory out there than people really are thinking. You guys think that your dealer inventory is right on?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY
 Arctic Cat CEO
 
No. I think I said earlier that our dealer inventory was up a bit over last year. A big part of any increase is new models, and I think I mentioned the two-rider vehicle that we put out in our Q1  really end  shipped wholesale at the end of Q4 last year and then when we start seeing those retail in Q1 of this year  but those are units that weren't in our dealer  that was a segment we weren't in last year, weren't in our dealer inventory last year and are in our dealer inventory this year, so some of those things are increasing dealer inventory for our dealers a bit. We're comfortable, at this point, with where the level of our dealer inventory level is.
 
CHUCK WALTIER  TRENTON CAPITAL
 
What's ATV sales for you guys up year-to-date? Not fiscal year-to-date; January to now?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat CEO
 
We're up about three percent. Now, that's not going to be  if you're following MIC numbers, that's maybe not exactly what you're going to see because MIC doesn't report our two-rider vehicle in their number, but as we look at our numbers, you've got to add another three percent or so to the MIC number to come up with our number, so we see ourselves up about three percent over last year.
 
CHUCK WALTIER  TRENTON CAPITAL
 
Can you guys tell us where your warranty reserve is now and how much you charge the provision and actually paid out  this quarter?
 
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
That will be more fully disclosed in our Q. I don't have that detail in front of me but it's, again, very  there is a lot of  a little more attention paid to warranty reserves with that Q disclosure, what was similar  if my memory is right, I think we paid out the same amount in June as we did a year ago. We had a little less added to the accrual this quarter due to the mix. You know, ATV has a lower warranty provision than a snowmobile, so that's generally what I can say at this point.
 
CHUCK WALTIER  TRENTON CAPITAL
 
Thank you.

AVI SUKENIK
 
Yes, I was just curious  the 53 percent increase year-over-year on the ATVs  were any special dealer incentives made, or did you find pricing firm to the dealers? A second question is, in the first quarter, the Company repurchased, I believe, 232,500 shares of the common stock. I was curious if you would know off-hand what the average price per share was. Do you have an upper target price which you won't exceed on the share buyback, or will that change as your outlook for earnings changes?
 
CHRIS TWOMEY -
Arctic Cat - CEO
 
Let me take the first question. The shipments to dealers were  the sales to dealers were made under the normal programs, which were announced at our dealer show in June, so there were no special programs announced, or there were no special concessions or programs other than what was normally announced at our June show. So, nothing special to get those out in the quarter.
 
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
As far as the share repurchase, we repurchased shares at essentially the range of prices we had during the quarter, and we have the authorization in place and we intend to execute on that authorization.
 
AVI SUKENIK
 
You wouldn't know what the average price cost to you was on that share buyback?
 
TIM DELMORE -
Arctic Cat - CFO
 
That is not at my fingertips, but again, it would be approximately in the $17.50 to $18.00 range.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ARCTIC CAT REPORTS RECORD SECOND-QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS
 
     
 - 
Revenues Up 13% in Quarter; 9% Year-to-Date
 - 
     
Second Quarter EPS Grows 8% to 98 Cents
 - 
     
Company Exceeds Quarterly Consensus Estimate of 96 Cents
     
 - 
Snowmobile Sales Increase 17%; ATV Sales Up 14% in Quarter
 
Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported record net sales of $237.7 million for the fiscal 2004 second quarter ended September 30, 2003, compared to $211.2 million in the same period last year. The net earnings for the quarter were $21.6 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, versus net earnings of $20.5 million, or 91 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Oct. 16
 
For the six-month period, net sales were $314.8 million compared to $289.5 million in  the first half of last year. Net earnings were $21.7 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, versus $22.5 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, for the prior year six-month period.
 
"We are pleased with our record second-quarter sales and earnings," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our results again exceeded the previous-year's record quarter."
 
Sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles totaled $117.7 million in the 2004 second quarter, an increase of 17 percent versus sales of $100.7 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date snowmobile sales were $152.4 million, up 3 percent from $147.8 million in the prior-year period.
 
"Snowmobile sales are on plan for the year," Twomey said. "Although we will produce fewer snowmobiles this year in response to lackluster snowfall in recent years, we continue to offer exciting new models, with cutting-edge technology, to snowmobile enthusiasts. A normal snowfall this winter could drive significantly increased snowmobile sales and greater profitability next year."
Among Arctic Cat's extensive 2004 model snowmobile line, it is the first manufacturer to offer a turbo-charged engine on a four-stroke snowmobile, which is cleaner and quieter than a two-stroke engine. This breakthrough T660 Turbo 4-Stroke sled outperforms the EPA's 2012 emissions requirements, and offers a cleaner, quieter and faster ride. The T660 Turbo 4-Stroke again demonstrates Arctic Cat's leadership in fuel-management technology.
 
Arctic Cat manufactures the lowest emission four-stroke snowmobiles available within the industry.
In September,
five of Arctic Cat's four-stroke snowmobiles became the first to be approved for use this winter in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park by the National Park Service (NPS), after meeting the NPS' new rules for lower snowmobile emissions and noise levels.
The emissions from Arctic Cat's approved four-stroke snowmobiles significantly outperformed both the NPS' requirements, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's year 2012 standards.
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) grew to $91.6 million, up 14 percent from $80.1 million in the prior-year second quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales increased 22 percent to $123.0 million. Arctic Cat's ATV sales continue to outpace industry sales, driven by demand for the company's innovative new products.
 
"We experienced particularly strong orders for our new 650cc V-Twin ATV, which is our most powerful ATV yet, and our DVX sports model," said Twomey. "Both were introduced in June and represent our first entries into the growing big bore and sport market segments. Many of our dealers have pre-sold these models before they hit their dealerships."
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales were $28.4 million compared to $30.4 million in the second quarter of last year. Six-month PG&A sales totaled $39.4 million versus $41.0 million in the previous-year period.
 
"We expect full-year PG&A sales to grow, led by ATV-related sales, despite a decrease in snowmobile garment sales this fiscal year," said Twomey.
 
During the second quarter, the company repurchased 843,000 shares of Class B stock from Suzuki Motor Corporation, or 4 percent of Arctic Cat's total outstanding shares. The buyback returned Suzuki's ownership to just under 32 percent, or 6.7 million shares, of Arctic Cat's common stock. The transaction allowed Arctic Cat to repurchase a large block of shares without adversely impacting the current level of publicly traded shares. The company has approximately 700,000 shares remaining under its board authorized repurchase program.
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2004 third-quarter net sales for the period ending December 31, 2003, in the range of $177 million to $185 million, compared to $176.2 million
for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between 43 cents and 47 cents per diluted share versus earnings of 53 cents per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. For comparison purposes, Arctic Cat's results in the prior-year third quarter benefited from a 15 cent per diluted share net reduction of restructuring accruals related to Arctic Cat's exit from the personal watercraft (PWC) business in September 1999. Excluding non-recurring items, comparable third-quarter earnings were 38 cents per diluted share in the year-ago period.
 
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will grow 3 to 6 percent and be in the range of $595 million to $607 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.41. Due to the seasonal nature of Arctic Cat's snowmobile and ATV products, the company sells the majority of its products during its second and third fiscal quarters.

PRESENTATION
 
Operator
 
Ladies and genlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Arctic Cat second-quarter 2004 earning conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, and afterwards we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, October 16, 2003.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Shawn Brumbaugh from Padilla Speer Beardsley. Please go ahead, ma'am.
 
Shawn Brumbaugh
- Padilla Speer Beardsley, Inc.
 
Thank you. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm Shawn Brumbaugh with Padilla Speer Beardsley. Chris Twomey, Chief Executive Officer of Arctic Cat, will be leading our call today. Also with me this morning is Tim Delmore, Arctic Cat's Chief Financial Officer.
 
All of you should have received a copy of the release reporting results for the second quarter ended September 30, 2003. Chris will take a few minutes to talk about highlights of the past three months, and then Tim will take you through the financials.
 
Before we begin, I must preface all comments with a Safe Harbor Statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ, and factors that may cause such results to differ are identified in the company's report on Form 10-K.
 
Now, I will turn the call over to Arctic Cat's CEO, Chris Twomey. Chris?
 
Christopher Twomey
- Arctic Cat, Inc. - - Chairman, President, CEO
 
Thanks, Shawn. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We're pleased with our sales and earnings for the second quarter. Both were in line with our expectations. Last year at this time, we reported that the second quarter was the largest sales and earnings quarter in the company history. I'm happy to be able to report that this year's second quarter was even better, and as a result, earnings are at the high end of expectations.
 
Retail sales of snowmobiles just began in September and October, so it's a little early to estimate how the year will finish. However, early retail sales to date are ahead of last year.
Also, attendance at all the fall snowmobile consumer shows are equal to or better than last year. This is particularly encouraging since the snow conditions last year in many areas of the country were the worst we have ever seen. Snowmobile consumers are still very enthusiastic about their sport.
 
Retail sales for the ATV industry continue to grow, and Arctic Cat's sales are again outpacing the industry. Attendance at ATV fall consumer shows is significantly higher than last year. It's great to also see the strong interest of the ATV customer.
 
As I said earlier, our retail sales are outpacing the ATV industry sales despite the fact that we have not been selling sleds in two of the fastest growing segments  the greater than 500 CC, or big bore, category and the sports performance market. Our new 650 Twin, which is a big bore machine, began arriving at our dealers in early October, and we think retail sales of this model should further strengthen our retail sales performance.
 
The sport performance market makes up over 20 percent of the overall ATV market and until now we have not been participating in this important segment. Our new 400 DVX has been very well received by our dealers and customers alike. In the long-term, this will be an increasingly important segment for Arctic Cat, and in the short-term it will further strengthen our current retail sales. Year to date, both of our exciting product lines are meeting our expectations, and we expect the same performance for the remainder of the fiscal year.
 
At this point, I'd like to ask Tim to comment on the numbers, and then I'll be happy to answer any questions that anybody has.

- Arctic Cat, Inc. - CFO, Secretary
 
Good morning. I would also like to welcome you to the conference call. Today I will be focusing on reviewing highlights of our second quarter financial performance as well as our outlook for the third quarter and the full year.
 
Net sales for the second quarter were $237.7 million versus $211.2 million for the second quarter last year. A 17 percent, or $16.9 million, increase in snowmobiles sales, and a 14 percent or $11.4 million increase in ATV sales, offset a planned decrease in second-quarter parts, garments and accessories sales, or PG&A sales. Our gross profits for the quarter were $56.2 million versus $53 million. The gross profit percentage for the quarter increased slightly to 23.6 percent, compared to 25.1 percent for the second quarter last year, due to more ATV's and less PG&A in the sales mix.
 
Quarterly selling, general, and administrative expenses were $24.6 million versus $23 million for the same quarter of last year. Net income for the quarter increased 5 percent to $21.6 million versus $20.5 million. Our diluted earnings per share increased 8 percent to 98 cents, versus 91 cents per share a year ago.
 
Next, I would like to review Arctic Cat's financial performance for the first six months of fiscal 04. Year-to-date net sales increased 9 percent to $314.8 million, versus $289.5 million a year ago. Net earnings were $21.7 million versus $22.5 million, while diluted earnings per share were 98 cents. On a year-to-date basis, a 22 percent increase in ATV sales and 3 percent increase in snowmobiles sales offset a planned first-half 4 percent decrease in parts, garments and accessories sales. We continue to expect full- year PG&A sales to be up over last year.
 
Our year-to-date gross profits increased 4 percent to $74.7 million versus $71.8 million. And our year-to-date gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 23.7 percent versus 24.8 percent, again, primarily due to increased ATV sales in the mix and less PG&A sales. Our year-to-date SG&A expenses increased to $43.2 million from $39.4 million.
 
We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, with $41 million in cash and zero debt. Inventories increased to $108 million due to a planned increase in ATV units, including our exciting new DVX sports model that will be shipped in October.
 
We repurchased 843,000 shares of Class B common stock from Suzuki Motor Corporation this quarter. The buyback returned Suzuki's ownership to the 32 percent level. We have approximately 700,000 shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.
 
Year-to-date capital expenditures totaled $11.2 million, and depreciation was $9.5 million. We expect full-year 2004 capital expenditures to total $27 million and depreciation to be approximately $17 to $18 million.
 
Looking ahead to full-year fiscal 2004, we are continuing to target an eight percent earnings per share growth to the $1.39 to $1.41 range, versus $1.30 adjusted EPS for last year. We expect our sales to end the year at the $595 million to $607 million range, and we anticipate our ATV sales to grow approximately 10 plus percent; our parts, garments, and accessories sales to grow 3 to 4 percent; and our snowmobile sales to be flat to down 2 percent. For our third quarter, we anticipate our sales will be in the $177 million to $185 million range compared to $176.2 million for the same period last year.
 
Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be in the 43 to 47 cents per share range, compared to 53 cents for the same quarter last year. However, if we exclude non-recurring items, our comparable third-quarter earnings were 38 cents per share for the third quarter last year.
 
I'd like to thank you for your attention, and operator, we'd now like to open it up for any questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER

Edward Aaron, RBC Capital Markets.
 
Edward Aaron

Thanks. Good morning, gentleman. A few questions for you. First, I was hoping to get your retail growth rate for ATV's in the second quarter? And second, when you look at the gross margins this quarter  I understand the mix shift because of PG&A, but could you maybe help quantify the impact that promotional spending might have had on the quarter?
 
And then, I'm struggling a little bit with understanding the Q3 guidance. There seems to be an expectation for a pretty significant mix shift toward ATVs in the third quarter, and you're still looking for a 50 basis point  at least 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin. So just wondering how you are going to get there with that mix shift?
 
Christopher Twomey
 
I will talk about the retail sales of ATVs in Q2. Again, as I said, the industry is growing, and our  we have outperformed the industry. In fact, our retail growth year-to-date is double what the  in the U.S., our retail growth is double what the industry is growing. So we are outperforming the industry in the U.S.
 
Edward Aaron
 - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
 
Okay.
 
Tim Delmore
 
Ed, you want to repeat your questions again  the financial questions?
 
Edward Aaron
 - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
 
In the second quarter, the impact of promotions on gross margin. I understand the low PG&A sales, but  kind of a little surprised at the magnitude of the gross margin change. So just wondering how much promotions played into that number?
 
Tim Delmore
 
Again, I don't know how we would quantify that, but I will say that the promotions we planned and communicated were as planned, and so we really have no surprise in margins.
 
Edward Aaron
 - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
 
My last question was just on the third-quarter guidance. It sounds like there is going to be a pretty big mix shift toward ATVs, but you're still looking for some pretty good margin improvement in the quarter. Just wondering how you're going to get there, since ATVs are a lower margin category?
 
Tim Delmore
 
Again, you are correct. We are going to ship through more (ph) snowmobiles next quarter and more ATVs, and again, margins have a number of factors in them, as you know. Mix is important in each product line, currency and sales incentives so it's just a combination of those items.
 
Edward Aaron
 - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
 
Are you assuming less incentive spending for the quarter compared to last year or ?
 
Tim Delmore
 
Yes, we are expecting some less incentives to be announced.
 
Edward Aaron

Nice quarter.

Hi, guys. Just a couple quick questions  one on the stock that you bought back from Suzuki. What did you pay for that?
 
Tim Delmore
 
Joe, we paid  there's a formula in our agreement with them, and it's based on the 20-day prior rolling average, or the 20-day rolling average prior to the purchase. So I don't remember exactly what it was. It was in around the $21 range. But it's a formula based on the average of the prior 21 days.
Joseph Hovorka
- Raymond James - Analyst
 
And do you know what the average share count is going to look like in the December quarter? Because that purchase was done towards the end of the September quarter, correct?
 
Tim Delmore
 
Right. The middle of September.
 
Joseph Hovorka
- Raymond James - Analyst
 
Do you know what the share count is going to look like in December?
 
Tim Delmore
 
It should be in the 21 million range.
 
Joseph Hovorka
 - Raymond James - Analyst
 
Okay. And then when you were answering the last question, you said that you expect lower incentives going into the December quarter. What has the trend been so far I guess in the last couple of months on the incentive trend? I guess I had the feeling that things were getting a little bit more promotional in the industry. Am I wrong in assuming that?
 
Christopher Twomey
 
I think that the promotional  particularly on the ATV side, the promotions have been greater this year than they were last year, and we've said that all along. I have not seen anything  we haven't seen anything that convinces me that it's going to be to dramatically different going ahead.
 
Joseph Hovorka
 - Raymond James - Analyst
 
So you would not expect an improvement in the December quarter then?
 
Christopher Twomey
 
It's going to be more than last year. We have got it in our plan.

THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Jan. 22  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported record net sales of $194.6 million for the fiscal 2004 third quarter ended December 31, 2003, up 10 percent from net sales of $176.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Third-quarter net earnings were $9.7 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $11.9 million, or 53 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year. For comparison purposes, results in the prior-year quarter included the net reduction of restructuring accruals related to Arctic Cat's exit from the personal watercraft (PWC) business in September 1999.  Excluding non-recurring items, net sales in the prior-year third quarter totaled $172.2 million and net earnings were $8.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share.
 
For the 2004 nine-month period, net sales grew 9 percent to $509.5 million versus $465.7 million in the year-ago period. Net earnings were $31.4 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $34.4 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Excluding non-recurring PWC items, net sales in the first nine months last year were $461.7 million and net earnings totaled $31.0 million, or $1.36 per diluted share.
 
"We're pleased to report record quarterly revenues that exceeded our expectations," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer. "Contributing to our strong performance were higher than anticipated snowmobile sales, and robust sales of both ATVs and parts, garments and accessories."
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) in the third quarter grew to $67.1 million, up 28 percent from $52.3 million in the same period last year. The company's year-to-date ATV sales increased 24 percent to $190.2 million compared to $153.2 million last year.
 
"We experienced growing demand for Arctic Cat's award-winning ATVs and continued to gain ATV market share," said Twomey. "With our current 2004 models, we expanded our ATV line to reach virtually all market segments, including the growing sport performance segment,
the two rider ATV segment, and the large displacement engine segment."  The company now offers a comprehensive line of 28 ATV models, ranging from 50cc to 650cc engines.
 
Arctic Cat's ATVs continued to earn industry accolades. Its most powerful ATV, the newly introduced 650 4X4 Automatic, was named "2004 ATV of the Year" by both and .

Snowmobile sales grew 5 percent in the third quarter to $100.9 million versus $96.0 million in the prior-year period. Year-to-date snowmobile sales also rose 4 percent to $253.3 million compared to $243.7 million during the same period last year.
 
In the 2004 model year,  Arctic Cat continued its leadership tradition of snowmobile innovation with the introduction of the industry's first turbocharged four-stroke snowmobile, the T660 Turbo. This industry-leading advancement offers snowmobilers a cleaner, quieter, more fuel efficient snowmobile along with the enhanced performance provided by turbo charging.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) increased 12 percent to $26.6 million versus $23.9 million in the prior-year third quarter. Year-to-date PG&A sales rose 2 percent to $66.0 million compared to $64.9 million in the year-ago period.
 
Reflecting the company's confidence in its financial strength and long-term prospects, Arctic Cat raised its quarterly cash dividend 17 percent to 7 cents per share of common and Class B common stock during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter ended December 31, 2003, the company reported $64.6 million in cash and no long-term debt.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat anticipates reporting record revenues for its 2004 fiscal year, ending March 31, 2004, primarily driven by higher ATV sales.
 
The company expects 2004 fourth-quarter net sales to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, compared to $111.4 million
for the same period last year. The net loss for the fourth quarter is estimated to be between 3 cents and 5 cents per diluted share versus a net loss of 8 cents per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Due to the seasonal nature of Arctic Cat's snowmobile and ATV products, the company sells the majority of its products during its second and third fiscal quarters, and typically reports a small loss in the fourth quarter.
 
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will
grow 9 percent to 11 percent and be in the range of $629 million to $639 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.41 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.45 last fiscal year, which included a benefit of 15 cents per diluted share from non-recurring PWC items.

Arctic Cat's full-year snowmobile sales grew 5 percent to $258.4 million versus $245.2 million in the prior year.

Arctic Cat to Manufacture 650 cc ATV Engine
 
"In fiscal 2005, we will begin manufacturing our own engines for use in select Arctic Cat ATVs," Twomey said. "This is a long-term strategic move that is designed to further strengthen our competitive position."
 
Initially, the company plans to manufacture engines for its 650 4x4 Automatic ATV.  T
he new engine, called the 650 H1, has been designed and assembled by Arctic Cat in an effort to offer its customers more choices and better value. Arctic Cat's first 650 ATV to include the H1 engine will become available late this year.
 
"This is an exciting first step in our new engine program that will provide long-term value to our entire ATV line," Twomey said.
"Moving forward, our intent is to build and continue to source the best engines that meet the requirements of our customers."
 
Three years in the making, the 650 H1 engine was developed using the latest manufacturing technology. Arctic Cat employed a highly specialized team of professionals to design the engine, as part of the all-new ATV Engine Division within Arctic Cat. The 650 H1 engine will be built in a new, state-of-the art facility in Thief River Falls, Minn.

Net earnings for the first quarter are estimated between breakeven to a loss of 6 cents per diluted share versus earnings of 0 cents per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will grow 4 to 8 percent and be in the range of $676 million to $700 million. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51, an increase of 4 to 8 percent compared to the prior year.

Board authorized $20 million share repurchase program
                 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., July 21  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $102.6 million for the fiscal 2005 first quarter ended June 30, 2004, up 33 percent versus $77.2 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter rose 22 percent to $124,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $102,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
 
"We are pleased to report record first-quarter sales," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our financial performance exceeded our expectations, as wholesale sales to dealers occurred at a faster pace than we had projected across all product lines."
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATVs) sales increased 24 percent to $39.2 million versus $31.5 million in the first quarter of last year.  "Dealers were excited with the introduction of the new 2005 model year ATVs. Our ATV retail sales continued to outpace the industry and we gained further market share," said Twomey.
 
In May, the company unveiled its new line of 2005 ATV models to dealers, including the all-new 650 H1 4X4 Automatic, which features the first ATV engine designed and assembled by Arctic Cat. The 650 H1 will become available to consumers in late fiscal 2005. The company also introduced limited edition 400 and 500 Automatic ATVs. One of the new features on Arctic Cat's ATVs this year, the popular MRP Speedrack accessory attachment system, is now a
standard feature on nearly all 2005 models. In addition, the company's new ATVs offer a quieter ride and enhanced sound quality.

237.7 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.99 to $1.02 per diluted share versus earnings of $0.98per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Due to the seasonal nature of Arctic Cat's snowmobile and ATV products, the majority of the company's sales occur during its second and third fiscal quarters.
Arctic Cat currently anticipates fiscal 2005 second-quarter net sales for the period ending September 30, 2004, to range between $245 million to $255 million, compared to $

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Oct. 21  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported record net sales of $240.7 million for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended September 30, 2004,  compared to $237.7 million in the same period last year. A delay in the timing of higher-margin snowmobile shipments constrained net earnings for the quarter to $19.7 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, versus $21.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The company previously reported that a one-week transportation delay in shipping some of its snowmobiles in the final days of the quarter pushed these sales from the fiscal second quarter into the fiscal third quarter.
 
For the six-month period, net sales rose to $343.3 million compared to $314.8 million in the first half of last year. Net earnings were $19.8 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, versus $21.7 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the prior-year first half.
 
" said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "All delayed snowmobiles were shipped shortly after quarter-end."
"We succeeded in surpassing last year's record second-quarter sales, despite the logistical issues we encountered,
 
Twomey added: "Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. We're excited about our 2005 product lineup, and we continue to expect another year of record sales and increased earnings."
 
During the 2005 second quarter, Arctic Cat reached an agreement with its Alaska distributor that will allow the company to sell directly to Alaska dealers. Arctic Cat anticipates that this strategic decision will enable further expansion of its market share in Alaska and positively impact the company's gross margins in future years.
 
As part of Arctic Cat's $20 million share repurchase program, the company bought 250,000 shares of its common stock in the fiscal second quarter.
 
Product Line Highlights
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) grew to $100.6 million, up 10 percent from $91.6 million in the prior-year second quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales increased 14 percent to $139.7 million versus $123.0 million in the first six months of last year.
 
"We believe we can continue to exceed the ATV industry's growth, as we have done every year since we entered this market in 1996," said Twomey. The company's ATV growth strategy includes expanding its product lineup into every ATV market segment, pursuing opportunities to increase its share of the southern U.S. market, and offering best-in-class ATVs at competitive prices.
 
Due to the timing of shipments, sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles decreased 5 percent to
$112.0 million in the 2005 second quarter versus $117.7 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date snowmobile sales grew 7 percent to $162.7 million compared to $152.4 million in the prior-year period. Arctic Cat continued its focus on driving further snowmobile market share gains in fiscal 2005 through innovative new product offerings, particularly in the mountain and touring segments.
 
"We are pleased that our completely new 2005 M7 mountain snowmobile was recently named 2005 Snowmobile of the Year' by ," said Twomey. "Our dealers and consumers have expressed strong interest in this exciting new product." The breakthrough M7 offers the industry's best power-to-weight ratio in the mountain segment, which translates into improved snowmobile acceleration and handling in deep snow.

Arctic Cat continued to set industry standards in lowering emissions through improved fuel management technology. After quarter-end, Arctic Cat's newest low-emission, quiet 4-stroke snowmobile, the T660 Touring 4-stroke, was officially certified for the fourth consecutive year for operation in Yellowstone National Park. The park requires snowmobiles to meet drastically reduced emissions and noise levels. Arctic Cat pioneered the low-emission 4-stroke engine, was the first manufacturer to receive certification for Yellowstone and is leading further improvements in this technology. In addition, the company's Turbo T660 4-stroke is the industry's first turbo-charged 4-stroke snowmobile, making it clean, quiet and fast.
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales were $28.1 million compared to $28.4 million in the year-ago second quarter. Six-month PG&A sales totaled $40.9 million versus $39.4 million in the prior-year period.
Outlook for Fiscal 2005 Second Half
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate that net sales will grow 4 percent to 8 percent and be in the range of $676 million to $700 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are estimated to grow 4 percent to 8 percent and be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51.
 
Arctic Cat expects net sales for the third quarter ending December 31, 2004, to range between $182 million to $192 million, compared to $194.6 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.25 and $0.27 per diluted share versus earnings of $0.46
per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
"We anticipate a dip in fiscal third-quarter earnings chiefly due to lower sales, a less rich sales mix and a less favorable Japanese foreign currency conversion," said Twomey. "However, we expect higher sales of ATVs in our fiscal fourth quarter than in previous fourth-quarter periods, leading to record full-year sales and higher earnings."

188.9 million for the fiscal 2005 third quarter ended December 31, 2004, down 3 percent compared to net sales of $194.6 million in the prior-year period. Third-quarter net earnings were $5.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $9.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the same period last year. The quarter's results reflect anticipated lower snowmobile sales and a less favorable Japanese foreign currency conversion.

"ATV sales continue to be our primary growth driver and we are successfully increasing our share of this market," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer. "During calendar year 2004, Arctic Cat's sales growth again outpaced the industry as we have every year since entering the ATV market."
 
84.1 million, up from $67.1 million in the same period last year. The company's year-to-date ATV sales rose to $223.9 million compared to $190.2 million last year. Production of the first Arctic Cat-designed and built ATV engine, the new 650 H1, is proceeding. The company is currently taking orders for the 650 H1 ATV model and expects to begin shipping this product in the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2005.

$78.9 million versus $100.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date snowmobile sales are on plan, totaling $241.6 million compared to $253.3 million during the same period last year. Arctic Cat has already unveiled its first 2006 model snowmobile, the Crossfire, a versatile hybrid machine designed for both mountain and trail riding.
Continuing a planned reduction in its fiscal 2005 snowmobile production after several seasons of poor snow conditions, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales declined in the third quarter to
Unseasonably warm weather through mid-December resulted in poor snow conditions in the East and Midwest, slowing industrywide retail snowmobile sales during the quarter. At the end of December and in early January, Arctic Cat's retail activity began gaining momentum due to snow accumulations in late December and retail sales programs announced earlier in the month. As a result of slightly lower wholesale and lower carryover inventory, overall inventory at the dealer level is manageable at this time.

Company Reiterates Outlook for 2005 Fiscal-Year Growth
 
"We expect higher sales of ATVs in our fiscal fourth quarter than in previous fourth-quarter periods, leading to record full-year sales and higher earnings," said Twomey.
 
Arctic Cat expects net sales for the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2005, to range between $155 million and $168 million, compared to $140.2 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.24 and $0.29 per diluted share versus a
net loss of $0.05 per diluted share

in the same period last year. The company's net earnings grew to $2.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., May 12  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported  record sales and earnings for the fourth-quarter ended March 31, 2005. Sales for the quarter increased 12 percent to $157.0 million versus $140.2 million
 
Arctic Cat posted its fifth consecutive year of record sales, with full-year net sales totaling $689.1 million, up 6 percent versus $649.6 million last fiscal year. Net earnings totaled $28.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $30.4 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, for fiscal 2004.
 
"Although I'm pleased that the company posted another year of record sales, our fourth- quarter performance was not as strong as we had anticipated,
" said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer of Arctic Cat Inc. "
Our results were impacted by rapidly escalating raw material surcharges during the quarter, as well as another mild winter across much of the United States that produced lower than projected sales of snow-related parts, garments and accessories. In addition, we announced a snowmobile promotion late in the quarter to assist our dealers."
 
During the 2005 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased 242,000 shares of its common stock. The company's board of directors also has provided a new authorization for the company to repurchase up to $20 million additional shares of its common stock from time to time in open market transactions.
Commenting on the new authorization, Twomey stated, "The share repurchase program increases shareholder value for investors.  Our board of directors believes that the repurchase of Arctic Cat's shares is an excellent use of the company's cash."
 
At the end of the 2005 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported $88.4 million in cash and no long-term debt.
 
Business Line Results
 
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) grew 12 percent in the 2005 fourth quarter to $117.1 million versus $104.2 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, Arctic Cat shipped its first 1,000 ATVs featuring the new 650 H1 engine. The H1 is the first ATV engine designed and assembled by Arctic Cat. For fiscal 2005, the company's ATV sales rose to $341.0 million, up 16 percent compared to last year. Arctic Cat's ATV retail sales continued to grow faster than the overall industry growth rate for both the quarter and the year.
 
in the prior-year quarter, as dealers responded enthusiastically to Arctic Cat's early release of the 2006 model CrossFire, a hybrid snowmobile for mountain and trail riding. During the quarter, the company's dealers also ordered additional M7 series mountain sleds, due to its strong retail sales. The M7 earned accolades as "Snowmobile of the Year."  As planned, Arctic Cat's full-year snowmobile sales declined 2 percent to $252.5 million, compared to $258.4 million in the prior year.
Snowmobile sales in the 2005 fourth quarter rose to $10.9 million versus $5.1 million
 
in the 2005 fourth quarter were $29.0 million versus $30.8 million in the year-ago period. For the full fiscal year, sales of parts, garments and accessories were down 1 percent to $95.7 million compared to $96.8 million last year. Fourth-quarter and full-year parts, garments and accessories sales were lower than anticipated due to the mild winter season in key regions across the United States.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories
 
Outlook
 
"Although we expect further sales growth in the year ahead, led by continued ATV market share gains, we believe that high raw material costs, lower snowmobile sales and an unfavorable Japanese yen/dollar exchange rate will impact the company's earnings potential in fiscal 2006," Twomey said. "To address these factors, we are aggressively pursuing a variety of cost-reduction initiatives, and continue our emphasis on producing best-in-class products in order to enhance customer satisfaction and drive shareholder value."
 
Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2006 first-quarter net sales for the period ending June 30, 2005, will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million compared to $102.6 million in the prior-year
period. Net earnings for the first quarter are estimated between breakeven to a loss of 5 cents per diluted share versus earnings of $0.01 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales will grow 3 to 5 percent and be in the range of $710 million to $723 million. Arctic Cat is forecasting lower margins in fiscal 2006, due to increased raw material costs, lower snowmobile sales and a less favorable Japanese yen/dollar exchange rate, resulting in full-year estimated diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.31 to $1.40.

Sales rise 5%
                 
 - 
Earnings per diluted share of $0.02

THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., July 21  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $107.9 million for the fiscal 2006 first quarter ended June 30, 2005, up 5 percent versus $102.6 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter rose to $448,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $124,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
 
"We are pleased to report another record first quarter," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "Sales increased across all product lines and exceeded our expectations, due to slightly higher than anticipated sales to dealers."
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales increased 6 percent to $41.4 million versus $39.2 million in the first quarter of last year.  "Our dealers responded positively to our 2006 model ATVs unveiled at our dealer show in June, " said Twomey.  "We demonstrated further progress on our ATV growth strategy to extend our products into every market segment and to offer best-in-class ATVs at competitive prices. Notably, in just two years, we have completely redesigned our ATV lineup and expanded into new categories that offer opportunities to further increase our market share."
 
Among the new 2006 ATVs recently introduced was Arctic Cat's first entry into the true utility category with the Prowler. The Prowler's extensive features include side-by-side bucket seats with seat belts, and a composite rear-cargo box designed for hauling and dumping.
Sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles rose 3 percent to $52.0 million compared to $50.7 million
in the prior-year first quarter, due to slightly earlier sales to dealers. Parts, garments and accessories increased to $14.5 million versus $12.7 million in the year-ago period, fueled by sales across all product lines.
 
During the 2006 first quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 185,000 shares of its common stock under the company's $20 million share repurchase program.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat currently anticipates fiscal 2006 second-quarter net sales for the period ending September 30, 2005, to range between $255 million and $267 million, up from $240.7 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.90 and $0.94 per diluted share versus earnings of $0.94
per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate that net sales will grow 3 percent to 5 percent and be in the range of $710 million to $723 million. The company is forecasting lower margins in fiscal 2006, due to increased raw material costs, lower snowmobile sales and a less favorable yen/dollar exchange rate, resulting in estimated full-year diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.31 to $1.40. Fiscal 2005 earnings per diluted share totaled $1.36.
 
"Our outlook for fiscal 2006 remains unchanged," said Twomey. "We continue to anticipate record full-year sales, but lower margins are expected to constrain earnings."

ARCTIC CAT REPORTS RECORD 2006 SECOND-QUARTER SALES
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Oct. 20  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported  net sales grew 15 percent to a record $276.3 million for the fiscal 2006 second quarter ended September 30, 2005, compared to $240.7 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter were $19.2 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, versus $19.7 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
 
For the six-month period, net sales rose 12 percent to $384.2 million compared to $343.3 million in the first half of last year. Net earnings were $19.7 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, versus $19.8 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in the prior-year first half.
 
constrained by lower margins; however, we continue to aggressively pursue initiatives designed to reduce costs and enhance the company's operational efficiency. Chief among these initiatives is our effort to build more of our own ATV engines, which we expect will strengthen our long-term profit margins."
said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "As anticipated, earnings were
"We are pleased to report strong revenue gains for the quarter, led by demand for our best-in-class ATV products,"
 
During the quarter, Arctic Cat announced that it will build a new ATV engine manufacturing facility in St. Cloud, Minn., in order to meet growing demand for its products. Arctic Cat introduced its first-ever designed and built ATV engine, the 650 H1, in the spring of 2005. The company plans to significantly boost production of the H1 engine this fiscal year.  Construction of the ATV engine manufacturing facility is slated to begin in calendar 2006, with the plant operational by 2007.
 
"We expect this new state-of-the-art facility to enhance our competitiveness by increasing our manufacturing efficiency and reducing our ATV engine costs," said Twomey. "In addition, it will provide us with greater flexibility and control over the ATVs we produce to better meet changing customer needs."
 
During its fiscal 2006 second quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased 401,500 shares of its common stock as part of its $20 million share repurchase program.

to $135.8 million, up 35 percent from $100.6 million in the prior-year second quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales increased 27 percent to $177.3 million versus $139.7 million in the first six months of last year.
Sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs grew
 
"We are pleased with the progress to-date of our ATV growth strategy to compete in all ATV market segments and to continue to build our international presence in the on-road European market," said Twomey. "As an example of our successful efforts, our innovative new Prowler UTV marked our first entry into the growing utility vehicle category and was a strong contributor to our ATV sales gains during the quarter."
 
Introduced to Arctic Cat's dealers in June 2005, the Prowler features side-by-side bucket seats and a functional, rear cargo bed. The company also expanded its presence in the sport performance ATV category with the introduction in June of the 250 DVX.
 
As anticipated, sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles were virtually flat at $111.4 million in the 2006 second quarter versus sales of
$112.0 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date snowmobile sales were $163.5 million compared to $162.7 million in the prior-year period.
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales totaled $29.0 million, up 3 percent compared to $28.1 million in the prior-year second quarter. Six-month PG&A sales totaled $43.5 million, an increase of 6 percent versus $40.9 million in the year-ago period.

Arctic Cat currently anticipates fiscal 2006 third-quarter net sales for the period ending December 31, 2005, to range between $189 million and $199 million compared to $188.9 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.19 and $0.24 per diluted share versus earnings of $0.28
per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Arctic Cat anticipates record net sales in the range of $710 million to $725 million. The company is continuing to forecast lower margins in fiscal 2006, due to increased raw material costs, lower snowmobile sales and a less favorable yen/dollar exchange rate, resulting in estimated full-year diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.31 to $1.36. Fiscal 2005 earnings per diluted share totaled $1.36.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Jan. 24, 2006  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $195.3 million for the fiscal 2006 third quarter ended December 31, 2005, up 3 percent compared to net sales of $188.9 million in the prior-year period. Third-quarter net earnings were $4.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $5.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
$532.1 million in the year-ago period. Net earnings totaled $24.3 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $25.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, in the nine-month period last year.
Year-to-date, net sales grew 9 percent to $579.5 million compared to
 
"Despite increased raw material costs, we were pleased to report a solid performance during the quarter and first nine months, and we remain on track to post our 6th consecutive year of record revenues," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer.  "Our results have been driven by increased ATV sales and further ATV market share gains for the quarter and year-to-date. We are very pleased that Arctic Cat's ATV sales continue to outpace the industry. We attribute our success to growing recognition of our best-in-class products, and Arctic Cat's reputation for innovation and technology leadership."
 
Product Line Results
 
84.1 million in the same period last year. The company's year-to-date ATV sales rose 20 percent to $268.1 million compared to $223.9 million in the same period last year.
Sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) in the third quarter grew to $90.8 million, up 8 percent from $
 
Demand for the company's new Prowler utility vehicle has exceeded expectations and contributed to Arctic Cat's ATV sales growth. The Prowler UTV was introduced in June 2005,
marking the company's first entry into the growing utility vehicle category. The Prowler features side-by-side bucket seats and a functional, rear cargo bed.
 
"We continue to benefit from our commitment to drive growth through new product introductions," said Twomey.  As an example of this, Arctic Cat plans an early 2007 model introduction of its most powerful ATV yet with a 700cc electronic fuel injection engine. The 700 EFI, announced in December, will begin shipping to dealers in Arctic Cat's fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2006.
 
Added Twomey: "Large displacement engines are the fastest-growing segment in the ATV industry. We are excited about the potential for our new 700 EFI model."
 
$78.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date snowmobile sales are on plan, totaling $238.0 million compared to $241.6 million during the same period last year.
As anticipated, Arctic Cat reported snowmobile sales in the third quarter of $74.5 million versus
 
"Snowmobile sales are tied to snow conditions," said Twomey. "When it snows, our customers buy sleds. While the market for snowmobiles remains strong among enthusiasts, this industry remains challenged by mild winter-weather conditions in key regions."
 
$25.8 million in the prior-year third quarter. Contributing to the quarter's PG&A results were increased sales of ATV-related parts and accessories. In areas with ample early snowfall, Arctic Cat also saw increases in snowmobile parts sales. Year-to-date PG&A sales grew 10 percent to $73.4 million compared to $66.7 million in the year-ago period.
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales were $30.0 million, up 16 percent versus
 
Arctic Cat repurchased 140,000 shares of its common stock in the fiscal third quarter and has approximately $10.5 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2005, the company had $63.7 million in cash and no long-term debt.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat currently anticipates fiscal 2006 fourth-quarter net sales for the period ending March 31, 2006, to range between $160 million and $170 million, up from $157.0 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.13 per diluted share versus earnings of $0.13
per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Arctic Cat now anticipates record net sales in the range of $740 million to $750 million. The company is continuing to forecast lower margins in fiscal 2006, due to increased raw material costs, lower snowmobile sales and a less favorable yen/dollar exchange rate, resulting in estimated full-year diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.31 to $1.35. Fiscal 2005 earnings per diluted share totaled $1.36.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
today announced that lower than anticipated sales of snowmobiles and snow-related parts, garments and accessories, coupled with increased sales incentive programs on snowmobiles and ATVs, are expected to impact its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006. As a result, fourth-quarter net sales are now estimated to be $153 million versus $157 million in the prior-year fourth quarter, and versus the company's earlier forecast of $160 million to $170 million. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to range from a loss of $(0.03) to $(0.05) per diluted share, compared with earnings per diluted share in the prior-year fourth quarter of $0.13. Arctic Cat had previously estimated fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share to be between $0.09 and $0.13.

"Despite the fact that we continued to gain ATV market share with our ATV retail sales outpacing the industry," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer, "our preliminary fourth-quarter results indicate that we experienced lower than anticipated sales of snowmobiles and snow-related parts, garments and accessories due to the poor snowfall in the East and Midwest, and increased sales incentive programs on snowmobiles and ATVs. As a result, we are revising our sales and earnings expectations for the 2006 fourth quarter and full year."
 
Commenting further, Twomey said, "We still expect to report record sales for fiscal 2006. Additionally, based on snowmobile orders already received, we expect increased snowmobile sales in
fiscal 2007. We also anticipate increased revenue from ATVs and parts, garments and accessories to result in another record sales year and increased earnings per share in fiscal 2007."
 
Arctic Cat expects to report its actual fiscal 2006 fourth-quarter and full-year results on May 11, 2006.

Thanks, Shawn. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Obviously, the fiscal-year 2006 fourth-quarter results are a huge disappointment for all of us at Arctic Cat. The disappointing change in earnings is primarily the result of lower-than-anticipated snowmobile and snowmobile-related parts, garments and accessories sales. Usually in Q4, we sell approximately 500 to 1,000 snowmobiles, made up of an early introduction model, to jump-start the enthusiasm for the upcoming model year, as well as some prior-year models which have remained unsold at the end of the year. Unfortunately, because of the poor North American industrywide retail market this year, and particularly in January, February and March, we sold only about half as many machines as planned. The unusually warm weather which began in January and continued through February and March meant that most snowmobilers from the Midwest to the East Coast didn't use their snowmobiles, which, of course, negatively impacted our parts and accessories sales for the quarter. We also experienced increased incentive for both product lines, which negatively impacted earnings for the quarter.
 
From my viewpoint, this is a problem related to the quarter and resulted from poor snowfall, and is not necessarily something that carries into next year. I have to say I am more certain about that from the product side from the incentive side.
First, let's talk about the products. We finished our model year 2007 snowmobile dealer show in mid-March. 2007 is the most extensive new model introduction that Arctic Cat has ever done, and in fact might be the largest new model introduction in the power sports industry for any one year. 75 to 80% of our 2007 models are new this year, and our dealers responded positively. Based on orders already received from our dealers, we expect snowmobile revenues to be up next year. Also, we are currently taking PG&A orders for fiscal year 2007, and they look strong as well. This is not what you might expect, based on the declining industrywide snowmobile retail sales. But it makes sense when you consider that 92% of the snowmobile customers are repeat buyers and new, innovative products are what cause them to buy.
 
In addition, I expect ATV revenues to be up in fiscal 07, led by our Prowler UTV as well as other new models which we will introduce at our ATV dealer show in a couple of months. For both calendar year 05 and so far in calendar year 06, our ATV retail sales are outperforming the industry, and we are gaining share. Those are the reasons that I'm optimistic about next year from the product side.
 
On the incentive side, it's a little more difficult to predict the future. While none of our competitors are currently dramatically more expensive than last year, however, incentives are creeping up. And as much as possible, we will remain competitive in this area as well. In prior years, we have not taken our incentives up as much as some of our competitors, and we have still gained market share. We anticipate the same will be true this year.
 
Let me conclude by saying all in all, I view these disappointing Q4 results as primarily a snow-related problem which does not carryover into FY 07.
 
At this point, we would open the call for questions.
 
QUESTION AND ANSWER

(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Rommel Dionisio.

First of all, thank you for your candor, Chris, explaining that. Just in terms of magnitude, is it possible to quantify how much of the shortfall was snowmobiles as opposed to PG&A, simply because I have about  and this may be a mistaken number, but I have 11 million in revenues for snowmobiles in the March quarter of 05, fiscal year 05. And even if you cut that too, let's say, 5 or 6 million it doesn't account for that much of the shortfall.
 
Chris Twomey
 - Arctic Cat Inc. - Chairman, CEO
 
I would say that you are about right on, on your snowmobile unit number. And I would say that overall, the effect was caused by about a third, a third and a third  a third of it coming from the snow side and a third of it coming from the parts and accessories side and then a third from additional incentives.
 
Rommel Dionisio
Analyst
 
And just a quick follow-up. There was (indiscernible) that there was a recall for snowmobiles, about 47,000 units. Is it possible to quantify what the magnitude of that would be?
 
Chris Twomey
 - Arctic Cat Inc. - Chairman, CEO
 
At this point, the total recall  that was a recall that we just announced last week for some cracking filler necks, 217 units out of about 41,000 in the US, about 0.4%. We are still going to take care of our customers and fix all of the filler necks for everybody, even though it's a relatively
small number. In general, we see that in about the $1 million range, and that is covered by our warranty reserve. We are yet to determine who is responsible for it, but it doesn't matter. We take care of the customer first, and then we figure out who is going to pay.
 
Rommel Dionisio
Analyst
 
That would only be about $20 a unit or $25 a unit, isn't it? Doesn't that sound kind of low?
 
Chris Twomey -
 
Arctic Cat Inc. - Chairman, CEO
 
It's really an amazing fix. All you're doing is inserting a sleeve into the existing filler neck. You're not replacing the tank. So it's a very  essentially, the customer will bring the sled into the dealer on his trailer, and the dealer will run out, take his gas cap off, put some glue on a filler neck and insert it into the gas tank and put the cap back on and send him home.
 
Operator
 
(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). And management, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.
 
Chris Twomey -
 
Arctic Cat Inc. - Chairman, CEO
 
I would like to thank all of you for joining us. Again, these are very disappointing results for us as well as, I'm sure, all of our shareholders. Again, I see this is a problem related to poor snow in Q4 of this year, and not one that carries over into next year. We look forward to updating all of you on a much broader basis on the 11th, when we talk about the full year. Thank you all very much.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ARCTIC CAT REPORTS FISCAL 2006 RESULTS
 
in the same period last year. The fourth-quarter net loss was $592,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $2.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., May 12  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $153.3 million for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared with net sales of $157.0 million
 
Arctic Cat posted its sixth consecutive year of record sales, with full-year net sales totaling $732.8 million versus $689.1 million last fiscal year. Net earnings totaled $23.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared with $28.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005.
 
"Our performance in fiscal 2006 was mixed, despite the fact that we posted another year of record sales," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer of Arctic Cat. "While our ATV sales grew, our
fourth quarter results were negatively affected by poor snowfall in the East and Midwest that reduced sales of snowmobiles and snow-related parts, garments and accessories, coupled with increased sales incentive programs on snowmobiles and ATVs."
 
During fiscal 2006, Arctic Cat repurchased 727,000 shares of its common stock. The company has approximately $10.5 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the 2006 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported $69.9 million in cash and no long-term debt.
 
Business Line Results
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales grew to $126.8 million in the 2006 fourth quarter versus $117.1 million in the same period last year. For fiscal 2006, the company's ATV sales rose to $394.9 million compared with $341.0 million last year.
 
Initially, Arctic Cat and Piaggio will cooperate on product distribution, with Arctic Cat selling its ATV
During the quarter, Arctic Cat announced a strategic partnership with the Piaggio Group to expand Arctic Cat's international distribution capabilities and open new growth channels for ATVs.
 
products through selected Piaggio dealers in Europe, and with Piaggio selling its motorcycles and motor scooters through selected Arctic Cat North American dealers.
 
In another move designed to increase operational efficiency and manufacturing flexibility, Arctic Cat remains on track to open an ATV engine manufacturing facility in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Construction on the plant is under way, with continued production of Arctic Cat's 650 H1 ATV engine slated to begin there in the fall of 2006.
 
Commented Twomey: "We remain excited about our ATV business for several reasons, chief among them is the fact that we continue to gain market share, as we have every year since we entered the ATV business. Strong sales of our Prowler UTV contributed to our growth in fiscal 2006. Further, we expect to improve Arctic Cat's efficiency and profitability, once we begin producing more of our own ATV engines and leveraging that investment. We also anticipate that the Piaggio partnership will enhance our penetration of the European market over the long-term."
 
in the prior-year quarter. Arctic Cat's 2006 fiscal year snowmobile sales totaled $238.1 million compared with $252.5 million in the prior year.
Snowmobile sales in the 2006 fourth quarter were $140,000 versus $10.9 million
 
In March, Arctic Cat unveiled its 2007 model year snowmobile line-up, which is the most extensive new model introduction in the company's history. The product line includes:
 
completely new designs across most snowmobile model segments;
 - 
     
 
a revolutionary new chassis that provides industry leading ride and comfort;
 - 
     
 
the snowmobile industry's most advanced 4-stroke snowmobile engine and the first engine specifically designed for use in a snowmobile, rather than adapted from another use; as well as
 - 
     
 
two totally new emissions-reduced, large displacement 2-stroke snowmobile engines, which will be used in most model segments.
 - 
     
 
"This may be the largest new model introduction in the power sports industry for any one year, as 75 percent to 80 percent of our 2007 model snowmobiles are new," said Twomey. "As a result, based on orders already received from our dealers, we expect snowmobile revenues to be higher in fiscal 2007 than they were in fiscal 2006."
 
in the 2006 fourth quarter were $26.4 million versus $29.0 million in the year-ago period. For the full fiscal year, sales of parts, garments and accessories totaled $99.8 million up from $95.7 million last year.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories
 
Outlook
 
For its fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, Arctic Cat anticipates shifting production of its significant new snowmobile models and related revenue and earnings into the second and third fiscal quarters. As a result of this production shift and its affect on snowmobile shipments, Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2007 first-quarter net sales for the period ending June 30, 2006, will be in the range
of $85 million to $95 million compared with $107.9 million in the prior-year period. The net loss for the first quarter is estimated to be $0.27 to $0.31 per diluted share,
including approximately $0.02 per diluted share for the non-cash expensing of stock options, in accordance with the company's adoption on April 1, 2006, of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123(R), which requires the expensing of all stock based compensation. Net earnings were $0.02 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
 
For the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2007, Arctic Cat anticipates reporting its seventh consecutive year of record sales. Net sales are estimated to grow 3 percent to 6 percent and be in the range of $754 million to $776 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.19
, including approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per diluted share for the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R).

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Arctic Cat posted its sixth consecutive year of record sales, with full-year net sales up 6 percent to $732.8 million versus $689.1 million last year. Despite this, our performance in fiscal 2006 was mixed.
Christopher A. Twomey
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Our all-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales continued to grow, fueled by best-in-class product offerings. Poor snowfall in the East and Midwest, however, reduced sales of snowmobiles and snow-related parts, garments and accessories, which constrained earnings. Further impacting our profitability were higher sales incentive programs on snowmobiles and ATVs in fiscal 2006, due to a highly competitive industry retail environment. As a result, net earnings were $23.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared with $28.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in the prior year. Although we anticipated that this would be a challenging year, we are disappointed with these financial results.
Arctic Cat repurchased 727,000 shares of its common stock during fiscal 2006, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value. The company has approximately $10.5 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. At year end, Arctic Cat had $69.9 million in cash and no long-term debt.
Continued ATV Market Share Gains
ATV sales grew 16 percent to $394.9 million and, for the first time accounted for more than 50 percent of Arctic Cat's total sales. We are excited about our ATV business for several reasons, chief among them is the fact that we continued to gain market share, as we have every year since entering this business.While industrywide retail sales declined slightly during calendar 2005, Arctic Cat's ATV sales increased in the mid-single digits. This is particularly encouraging since our sales grew in almost every segment of the ATV market.
Strong sales of our new Prowler Utility Vehicle (UTV) contributed to our growth in fiscal 2006. This product, which we introduced last year, provides Arctic Cat with an opportunity to expand into the rapidly growing utility vehicle market.We expect ATV revenues to be up in fiscal 2007, led by the Prowler UTV, as well as the 700 EFI, 650 H1, and a broader range of specially equipped models.
We also anticipate further improving Arctic Cat's operating efficiency, profitability and manufacturing flexibility once we begin producing more of our own ATV engines. To this end, we remain on track to open a 60,000-square-foot ATV engine manufacturing facility in St. Cloud, Minn. Production of Arctic Cat's 650 H1 ATV engine is slated to begin there in late fall of 2006.
We expect to leverage our investment in this facility as production ramps up. While we continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with our current engine supplier, having the capability to design and build our own ATV engines provides many benefits. Among them, it will enable us to offer customers more choices, reduce our engine costs and foreign currency exposure, and improve profitability.
Additionally, during the upcoming year, we plan to increase parts sourcing from low-cost countries in order to expand our margins. Identifying suppliers who can meet our exacting quality standards requires careful attention. However, we anticipate this initiative will leverage our earnings potential.
Pursuing Strategy for International Growth
Arctic Cat's international business accounted for 8 percent of fiscal 2006 revenues.We aim to double this over the next three years.
In fiscal 2006, we acquired our European ATV distributor. This better positions us to participate in Europe's rapidly growing ATV market, particularly with ATVs that are driven on-road. With this acquisition completed, we are focused on transitioning to a dealer-direct distribution model in order to compete more aggressively in the European market. Our goal is to establish a foundation for greater international growth in fiscal 2008 and beyond.
As part of our international expansion effort, we also announced in March 2006 a strategic business partnership with Italy-based Piaggio Group, which will further enhance our international market penetration. Our partnership with Piaggio is expected to help Arctic Cat quickly expand its dealer-direct distribution of ATVs in Europe. Initially,

Arctic Cat and Piaggio will cooperate on product distribution, with Arctic Cat selling its ATV products through selected Piaggio dealers in Europe, and with Piaggio selling its motorcycles and motor scooters through selected Arctic Cat North American dealers.
Focused on Revving Snowmobile Sales
The snowmobile business remains a profitable one for us. Unfortunately, we again experienced another year of poor snow conditions during the critical winter selling season. This also impacted snow-related sales of parts, garments and accessories. As a result, snowmobile sales in fiscal 2006 declined 6 percent to $238.1 million compared with $252.5 million in the prior year. Snowmobiles now comprise less than 35 percent of the company's total sales.
Snowmobile customers are intensely brand loyal and driven to purchase machines which capture their imagination with innovation and advances in technology. Extensive research conducted with thousands of customers who have bought Arctic Cat sleds over a 10-year period indicates that only 6 percent are no longer involved with the sport. The vast majority are simply not buying a new snowmobile because they haven't had an opportunity to put many miles on their existing sleds, due to a lack of snow, and they haven't seen enough innovation and technology to motivate them to buy.
We believe we can motivate these customers to buy again with exciting new products that offer significant improvements over what they are currently riding. This is why we are so excited about next year's snowmobile offering.
In March, Arctic Cat unveiled its 2007 model year snowmobile line up, which is the most extensive new model introduction in the company's history. The product line includes:
completely new designs across most snowmobile model segments;
                 
a revolutionary new chassis that provides industry leading ride and comfort;
                 
the snowmobile industry's most advanced 4-stroke snowmobile engine  which is the first 4-stroke engine specifically designed for use in a snowmobile, rather than adapted from another use; as well as
                 
two new, lower emission, large displacement 2-stroke snowmobile engines with 800cc and 1000cc, which will be used in most model segments.
                 
This may be the largest new model introduction in the power sports industry for any one year, as 75 percent to 80 percent of our 2007 model snowmobiles are new. As a result, based on orders already received from our dealers, we expect snowmobile revenues to be higher in fiscal 2007 than they were in fiscal 2006. This is not what you might expect, based on the declining industrywide snowmobile retail sales. It makes sense, however, when you understand that 92 percent of snowmobile customers are repeat buyers  and new, innovative products are what drive them to buy.
Sales of Arctic Cat's parts, garments and accessories totaled $99.8 million, up 4 percent from $95.7 million last year, chiefly driven by increased ATV parts and accessories sales due to our larger installed base of ATVs.We plan to focus on expanding ATV accessory sales with exciting higher-priced products, all of which have demonstrated strong retail demand.
Expecting Record Fiscal 2007 Sales, Higher Earnings
Although I expect fiscal 2007 to be another challenging year, I see a strong future ahead for Arctic Cat.
We are focused on sustaining our profitability and long-term growth across all business segments, through continued market share gains and increased efficiency. And we remain passionate about producing the best-in-class products for which Arctic Cat is known.
Our emphasis on launching innovative, new snowmobile models for the upcoming season is generating positive early results, and is expected to lead to increased snowmobile sales in fiscal 2007.We also anticipate increased revenue from ATVs and parts, garments and accessories, resulting in another record sales year and increased earnings per share in fiscal 2007.
I look forward to updating you on our progress.
Sincerely,
Christopher A. Twomey
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., July 26  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $96.4 million for the fiscal 2007 first quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared to $107.9 million for the same period last year. The net loss for the quarter was $4.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share for the non-cash expensing of stock options as required by SFAS 123(R), which the company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The company reported net earnings in the prior-year period of $448,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, which did not include the non-cash expensing of stock options.
than planned, primarily due to higher all-terrain vehicle sales to dealers," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer.  "We are pleased with our dealers' positive response to our newest model ATVs, which we unveiled at our June dealer show. We also are encouraged that retail sales of Arctic Cat ATVs grew at a much faster pace than the overall ATV industry during the quarter."
"Our first quarter results were better
ATV sales increased 45 percent to $60.2 million in the first quarter versus $41.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The company attributed the ATV sales gains to continued high demand for its Prowler UTV and the timing of shipments.
 Arctic Cat's
As expected, snowmobile sales declined 60 percent to $20.9 million from $52.0 million
in the prior-year quarter. Contributing to these results was the previously disclosed,
planned shift of Arctic Cat's extensive new 2007 model snowmobile production, along with related revenue and earnings, into the company's 2007 second and third fiscal quarters. The company still expects full-year snowmobile revenues to exceed last year based on the strength of its 2007 model line-up, of which nearly 80 percent is new models.
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales grew 6 percent to $15.4 million versus $14.5 million in the year-ago period. PG&A benefited primarily from ATV parts and accessories
 
sales, including Arctic Cat's new SPEEDPoint System of pull-behind attachments that enable ATVs to be used for a broader range of farming and landscaping activities.
During the 2007 first quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 112,500 shares of its common stock, leaving $8.5 million remaining under the company's $20 million share repurchase program.
Outlook
"We anticipate reporting record full-year sales for fiscal 2007," said Twomey.  "However, lower margins are expected to continue to constrain earnings, primarily as a result of our continued shift in product mix to a higher percentage of ATV sales versus snowmobiles."
Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2007 second-quarter net sales for the period ending September 30, 2006, to range between $290 million and $300 million, up from $276.3 million for the same period last year. Net earnings are estimated to be between $1.03 and $1.08 per diluted share, including the impact of SFAS 123(R), which is estimated to be $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter. The company reported earnings of $0.96 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter, which did not include the non-cash expensing of stock options.
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate reporting its seventh consecutive year of record sales. Net sales are estimated to grow 3 percent to 6 percent and be in the range of $754 million to $776 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.19
, including approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per diluted share for the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). In f
iscal 2006, the company reported full-year earnings per diluted share of $1.20, which did not include the non-cash expensing of stock options.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
The fiscal 2007 second quarter earnings include $0.02 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). The company reported net earnings in the prior-year period of $19.2 million, or $0.96 per diluted share.
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Oct. 25  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported  net sales grew to $285.3 million for the fiscal 2007 second quarter ended September 30, 2006, compared to $276.3 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter increased to $20.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share. This was in the range of the company's earnings guidance of $1.03 to $1.08 per diluted share.
e are confident that we remain on track to post sales gains across all of our product lines for the fiscal year."
said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "W
"Our record sales and increased earnings for the second quarter were driven primarily by a 9 percent increase in snowmobile sales, continued strong demand for our Prowler utility ATV, and higher ATV parts and accessories sales,"
Some snowmobile and ATV sales to dealers that were anticipated to occur in the second quarter will now occur in the third quarter, due to the timing of shipments. Arctic Cat continues to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 5 percent to 9 percent for snowmobiles, a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in ATV sales, and a gain of 3 percent to 6 percent for parts, garments and accessories sales.
For the six-month period, net sales were $381.7 million compared to $384.2 million in the first half of last fiscal year. Net earnings were $15.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $19.7 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the prior-year first half. The
fiscal 2007 first half earnings include $0.03 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R).
During its fiscal 2007 second quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 100,000 shares of its common stock, leaving $6.8 million remaining under the company's $20 million share repurchase program.
Product Line Results
$133.8 million compared to $135.8 million in the prior-year second quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales grew 9 percent to $194.0 million versus $177.3 million in the first six months of last fiscal year.
Sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs totaled
The Prowler UTV continued to be a strong contributor to Arctic Cat's ATV business during the second quarter and first six months. During the second quarter, Arctic Cat also began shipping the industry's first twin cylinder diesel ATV with the introduction of its new Diesel 700 model.
"We are excited to begin shipping the first biodiesel-compatible ATV," said Twomey.  "This machine reflects our stewardship goal to be a leader in fuel efficiency."
Arctic Cat's Diesel ATV, with its exceptional low-end torque, is ideally matched to Arctic Cat's line of SPEEDPoint accessories, making the machine highly versatile and allowing operators to change a variety of accessories in less than a minute.
Sales of Arctic Cat snowmobiles totaled $121.5 million in the 2007 second quarter, up 9 percent versus sales of
$111.4 million in the same period last year. Contributing to the increase was the previously disclosed shift of Arctic Cat's extensive new model snowmobile production, and related revenue and earnings, into the company's fiscal 2007 second and third quarters. The company's year-to-date snowmobile sales totaled $142.4 million compared to $163.5 million in the prior-year period.
Arctic Cat continues to anticipate that its full-year snowmobile revenues will exceed last year based on strong dealer orders for its 2007 model line-up, of which 80 percent are new models. In recognition of its snowmobile innovation this year, three 2007 Arctic Cat sleds already have been named among the year's top sleds by a leading industry magazine. Snowmobiles chosen to receive this honor include Arctic Cat's Jaguar Z1, with the first 4-stroke engine built specifically for snowmobiles, the fast F8 Sno Pro, and the M1000 mountain sled with its leading power-to-weight ratio.
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales rose 3 percent to $30.0 million compared to $29.0 million in the prior-year second quarter. PG&A continued to benefit primarily
2
from increased ATV parts and accessories sales. Six-month PG&A sales grew 4 percent to $45.3 million versus $43.5 million in the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2007 third-quarter net sales for the period ending December 31, 2006, to range between $210 million and $230 million, compared to $195.3 million for the same period last year. Net earnings are estimated to be between $0.33 and $0.38 per diluted share, including the impact of SFAS 123(R), which is estimated to be $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter. The company reported earnings of $0.24 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter, which did not include the non-cash expensing of stock options.
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate reporting its seventh consecutive year of record sales.

Exhibit 99.1
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Jan. 24  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales grew to $228.1 million for the fiscal 2007 third quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to $195.3 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter increased to $8.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, including $0.02 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Fiscal 2007 third-quarter earnings also include an income tax benefit of $0.03 per diluted share. The company reported net earnings in the prior-year quarter of $4.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, which did not include the non-cash expense of stock options.
"Contributing to record sales and increased earnings for the third quarter were anticipated higher snowmobile sales and continued strong demand for our Prowler utility ATV," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "Although we expect to post sales gains across all of our product lines this fiscal year, and will report our seventh consecutive year of record sales, challenging market conditions for our snow-related products could impact our full-year profitability."
For the nine-month period, net sales rose to $609.9 million compared to $579.5 million in the same period last year. Net earnings were $23.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $24.3 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, in the nine-month period last year. The fiscal 2007 year-to-date earnings include $0.05 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R).
During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 915,000 shares under its stock repurchase program, comprised of 300,000 shares of common stock and 615,000 shares of class B common stock from Suzuki Motor Corporation. As a result of the buyback, Suzuki owns 33 percent, or 6.1 million shares, of Arctic Cat's common stock.  The company has
(more)
approximately $10.8 million, or 612,000 shares, remaining under its board-authorized repurchase program.
Product Line Results
Sales of Arctic Cat's snowmobiles totaled $106.4 million in the 2007 third quarter versus sales of $74.5 million in the same period last year. Contributing to the increase was the previously disclosed shift of Arctic Cat's extensive new model snowmobile production, and related revenue and earnings, into the company's fiscal 2007 second and third quarters. The company's year-to-date snowmobile sales totaled $248.8 million compared to $238.0 million in the prior-year period.
Sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs totaled $91.8 million, up 1 percent compared to $90.8 million in the prior-year third quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales grew 7 percent to $285.8 million versus $268.1 million in the first nine months of last fiscal year. Arctic Cat's Prowler UTV continued to be a strong contributor to the company's ATV business during the third quarter and first nine months.
"We are very pleased with the success of the Prowler UTV, which is our first entry into the growing UTV segment," said Twomey. The Prowler UTV was recently named as the "Best UTV in its Class" by for its sporty performance, innovative features, style and functionality.
All-Terrain Vehicle Magazine
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales totaled $29.9 million compared to $30.0 million in the prior-year third quarter. Nine-month PG&A sales grew 2 percent to $75.3 million versus $73.4 million in the year-ago period, primarily fueled by increased ATV parts and accessories sales.
Outlook
Arctic Cat anticipates fiscal 2007 fourth-quarter net sales for the period ending March 31, 2007, to range between $150 million and $170 million, compared to $153.3 million for the same period last year. The net loss in the fourth quarter is estimated to be between $0.07 and $0.15 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.02 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). The company reported a net loss of $0.03 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter, which did not include the non-cash expense of stock options.
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate reporting record sales. Net sales are estimated to grow 4 percent to 6 percent and be in the
2
range of $760 million to $780 million. However, a sluggish industrywide retail environment for snow-related products could generate lower PG&A sales and require higher sales incentives on snowmobiles than planned. As a result, Arctic Cat's full-year diluted earnings per share are now anticipated to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.15, including approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share for the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). In fiscal 2006, the company reported full-year net sales of $732.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.20, which did not include the non-cash expense of stock options.

in the same period last year. The fourth-quarter net loss was $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, including $0.02 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). The company reported a net loss in the prior-year fourth quarter of $592,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, which did not include the non-cash expense of stock options.
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., May 15  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $172.6 million for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended March 31, 2007, up 13 percent compared with net sales of $153.3 million
Arctic Cat posted its seventh consecutive year of record sales, with full-year net sales increasing 7 percent to $782.4 million compared with $732.8 million last fiscal year. Full-year net earnings totaled $22.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $23.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006.  The fiscal 2007 net earnings include $0.08 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R).
"We succeeded in posting sales gains across all of our products lines in fiscal 2007 and achieved another year of record sales," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer of Arctic Cat.  "We are pleased that we gained further market share in our ATV and snowmobile businesses, as our retail sales continued to outpace these industries. However, challenging snowmobile market conditions caused by poor snow in the Midwest and East led to
increased sales incentive programs on snowmobiles, which
dampened our overall profitability."
During fiscal 2007, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock. The company has approximately $10.8 million remaining on its current $20 million share repurchase authorization. At the end of the 2007 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported $75 million in cash and no long-term debt.
Arctic Cat Reports Fiscal 2007 Results
Business Line Results
ATV revenues increased for the quarter and full-year due to strong contributions from the Prowler UTV. The company also benefited from increased international ATV sales.
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales grew 15 percent to $145.8 million in the 2007 fourth quarter versus $126.8 million in the same period last year. For fiscal 2007, the company's ATV sales rose 9 percent to $431.5 million compared with $394.9 million last year.
"We succeeded in establishing our international dealer-direct distribution network in all major European markets during fiscal 2007, and we expect strong double-digit international growth in fiscal 2008," said Twomey.
During the 2007 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat began full production of ATV engines at its new engine manufacturing facility in St. Cloud, Minn. This facility enables the company to increase its operational efficiency, profitability and manufacturing flexibility. Currently, the company is producing one ATV engine at this site, with plans to expand its engine production and add new ATV engines to its model line during the current fiscal year.
 "Looking ahead, we expect the Prowler and international sales to drive further ATV sales growth," said Twomey. "In addition, we will introduce new industry leading ATV products at our June dealer show. Overall, we are very excited about our ATV growth plans."
. For the 2007 fiscal year, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales increased 4 percent to $247.0 million compared to $238.1 million in the prior year.
Snowmobile sales declined in the 2007 fourth quarter and were a negative $1.8 million, due to sales incentive accruals. In the prior-year quarter, snowmobile sales totaled $140,000
"As expected, our full-year snowmobile revenues were higher in fiscal 2007 than a year ago, fueled by the largest new model introduction in the company's history," said Twomey. "Arctic Cat's retail snowmobile sales outpaced the industry's overall retail sales in fiscal 2007 on the strength of our new products."
(PG&A) in the 2007 fourth quarter increased 9 percent to $28.6 million versus $26.4 million in the year-ago period, driven by increased sales of snow-related parts and accessories during the quarter. For the full fiscal year, PG&A sales grew 4 percent to $103.9 million, up from $99.8 million last year, primarily due to higher sales of ATV parts and accessories.

Company Announces Growth and Profitability Initiatives
Arctic Cat is announcing three strategic initiatives designed to better position the company for future growth and profitability.
First, the company plans to reorganize its business into three separate units, encompassing  ATVs, snowmobiles and PG&A. Each business unit will be led by a general manager with profit and loss responsibilities. This reorganized structure will enable the company to better focus on growing each business. Second, Arctic Cat plans to relocate its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to the Minneapolis area by the fall of 2007. The company's manufacturing operations will remain in their existing locations and will not be affected. The reorganization and corporate headquarters move is anticipated to cost approximately $1.6 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. The company expects that half of this amount will be a one-time expense. Further details on the reorganization will be announced later this year.
Third, during the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, Arctic Cat plans a one-time reduction in its snowmobile production of approximately 30 percent to help dealers lower their snowmobile inventory levels to more closely match anticipated consumer demand in the year ahead. As previously announced in February, the company streamlined its workforce to better align its cost structure and resources with the current business conditions.
"We remain enthusiastic about the snowmobile business," said Twomey. "We expect to maintain our technological leadership and competitive position in the snowmobile market, and will continue investing in this business at a sustainable and profitable level going forward."
Outlook
As a result of Arctic Cat's planned initiatives in fiscal 2008 to improve its future profitability and growth prospects, the company expects lower net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, in the range of $710 million to $736 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.95
.
Commented Twomey: "We expect continued strong growth in our ATV business in fiscal 2008 and beyond. We have already taken steps to size our workforce to realistically reflect the current snowmobile market. After a one-time production adjustment in fiscal 2008, we expect to modestly and profitably grow our snowmobile business going forward. I am confident and excited about our long-term growth prospects."
Arctic Cat's first-quarter net sales, for the period ending June 30, 2007, are estimated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million versus net sales of $96.4 million in the same period last year. The net loss for the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.47 per diluted share
versus a loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. F
irst-quarter net sales and

earnings will be impacted by lower snowmobile production and a shift in ATV shipments to future quarters to better align with market demand.

Arctic Cat markets its productS through a network of independent dealers located throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, and through distributors representing dealers in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and other international markets. The company trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ACAT. For more information, please visit Arctic Cat's website at www.arcticcat.com.

[PHOTO] NOW THE LARGEST U.S. SNOWMOBILE MANUFACTURER Due to our continuing innovation and technology leadership, Arctic Cat is now the largest U.S. snowmobile manufacturer for the first time in our history. Demand for our extensive and high-performance line of parts, garments and accessories has contributed to our growth.

[PHOTO -- CHRISTOPHER A. TWOMEY] TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WE ACHIEVED OUR SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF RECORD SALES IN FISCAL 2007 AND REPORTED SALES GAINS ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, DESPITE A CHALLENGING AND INTENSELY COMPETITIVE YEAR IN OUR BUSINESS. We also succeeded in gaining further all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and snowmobile market share, as our retail sales continued to outpace sales in these industries. However, difficult snowmobile market conditions caused by another year of poor snow in the Midwest and East led to increased sales incentive programs on snowmobiles, which dampened our overall profitability. Arctic Cat's full-year net sales increased 7 percent to $782.4 million compared with $732.8 million last fiscal year. Full-year net earnings totaled $22.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, including $0.08 per diluted share for the non-cash expense of stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). The company reported prior-year net earnings of $23.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, which did not include the non-cash expense of stock options. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock, reflecting the board of directors' belief that the company's stock remains a good investment and as part of our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value. Arctic Cat has approximately $10.8 million remaining on its current $20 million share repurchase authorization. The company ended the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet, including $75 million in cash and no long-term debt. MORE ATV INDUSTRY "FIRSTS" ATV sales rose 9 percent to $431.5 million, primarily due to strong contributions from our Prowler(R) utility vehicle, which was named "Best Trail Recreational Side-by-Side." The company also benefited from increased international ATV sales, as we succeeded in establishing our international dealer-direct distribution network in all major European markets during fiscal 2007. We believe the "on road" European ATV market represents a significant opportunity to expand our business. Another highlight during the fiscal year was the start of engine manufacturing at our new facility in St. Cloud, Minn., which we opened for strategic reasons in order to be first-to-market with the engines consumers want. This facility also will enable us to increase our operational efficiency, profitability and manufacturing flexibility. We began producing one model of ATV engine at this site. We plan to expand the number of engine models we produce in St. Cloud and add new ATV engines to Arctic Cat's model line during fiscal 2008. Among them will be our new Thundercat(R) 1000, which offers the largest displacement ATV engine in the industry. We introduced the Thundercat 1000 in June 2007. This ATV exemplifies the innovative, technology leading engines Arctic Cat can now make at our St. Cloud facility that are not available any place else in the market. Arctic Cat also is setting new standards by offering the industry's first biodiesel-compatible ATV, with the introduction of our new Diesel 700 model. This machine reflects our stewardship goal to be an environmental leader in all of our markets. It is ideally suited for use with our line of SPEEDPointTM farming and landscaping attachments, making the machine highly functional and versatile across a broad range of applications. Looking ahead, we expect ATV growth to be driven by continued strong sales of the Prowler UTV, increased international penetration and the introduction of new, industry leading ATV products. We are excited about our ATV growth momentum and plans. THE #1 U.S. SNOWMOBILE MANUFACTURER As expected, our full-year snowmobile revenues were higher in fiscal 2007 than a year ago, fueled by the largest new model introduction in Arctic Cat's history. Approximately 80 percent of our 2007 model line-up was comprised of brand new models. With the 2008 model year introductions, nearly all of our snowmobile models are new within the last two years. These innovative products have helped drive retail sales of Arctic Cat's sleds despite a lack of snow in key regions. As a result, for the 2007 fiscal year, the company's snowmobile sales rose 4 percent to $247.0 million. For the first time, Arctic Cat is now the largest-selling U.S. manufacturer of snowmobiles. We continued to gain market share during the fiscal year, as Arctic Cat's retail snowmobile sales outpaced the industry's overall retail sales in fiscal 2007 on the strength of our exciting, new products. In recognition of our snowmobile innovation, three 2007 Arctic Cat sleds were named as the year's top sleds: the Jaguar Z1, with the first 4-stroke engine built specifically for snowmobiles; the F8 Sno Pro(R); and the M1000 mountain sled, which offers an industry leading power-to-weight ratio. CONTINUED PG&A GROWTH Our full-year parts, garments and accessories sales increased 4 percent to $103.9 million, mostly due to higher sales of ATV parts and accessories. We believe the ATV accessory market offers significant opportunities for future growth and we plan to concentrate on further building our PG&A business in the ATV market. We also know that snow-related PG&A products can substantially enhance sales when our customers see snow. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE GROWTH & PROFITABILITY Although Arctic Cat's revenues in fiscal 2007 reached an all-time high, we are not satisfied with our bottom-line results. We have taken several strategic actions that are designed to improve our long-term profitability and growth prospects. First, we reduced our workforce by 4 percent in February 2007 to lower the company's cost structure and align our resources with the current market conditions, particularly for snow-related products. ARCTIC CAT 2007 ANNUAL REPORT 2
Second, we announced plans for a one-time, 30 percent reduction in snowmobile production during fiscal 2008. This adjustment will help our dealers lower their snowmobile inventory levels to more closely match anticipated consumer demand in the year ahead. We have taken this action because the lack of snowfall for 10 consecutive years in various regions of North America has led to lower industrywide, retail snowmobile sales and slightly higher dealer inventories. In fiscal 2007, as in past years, the areas of North America that received good snow conditions experienced strong growth in retail sales by as much as 20 percent to 60 percent. However, in the rest of the country, where snow was sparse or non-existent, retail sales declined and our dealers' inventories have risen slightly. As a result, this year we decided to ask those dealers with increased inventories to order fewer units in fiscal 2008, in order to bring their inventories in line with demand. As inventories decline next year, we expect dealers to increase their snowmobile orders modestly. The newness of our entire snowmobile line-up means that even our dealer carryover inventory is fresh and should sell well with snow. Overall, we continue to be excited about the snowmobile business. Our customer research and sales patterns show that there is pent-up demand among customers who are simply waiting for snow. We plan to keep investing in this business at levels that allow us to maintain our technological leadership and competitive position, while realistically reflecting the current size of the market. Our third strategic initiative is one that has been ongoing, however, we have sharpened our focus on generating greater savings from global, low-cost sourcing. This procurement effort is being led by cross-functional teams from operations, engineering and quality. Our goal is to improve the company's profitability through increased global sourcing, while maintaining our high quality standards. As a result of this initiative, we already have identified opportunities to reduce our costs by more than $8 million in fiscal 2009, with additional opportunities in fiscal 2010. Fourth, we announced our plan to reorganize Arctic Cat into three separate business units for ATVs, snowmobiles and PG&A. Each business unit will be led by a general manager with profit and loss responsibilities. This reorganized structure will enable the company to better focus on profitably growing each business. In a related move, we also announced the planned relocation of our corporate headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to the Minneapolis area by the fall of 2007. The company's manufacturing operations will remain in their existing locations and will not be affected. The reorganization and corporate headquarters move is anticipated to cost approximately $1.6 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008; half of this amount is expected to be a one-time expense. The new location will improve the company's operating efficiencies by placing corporate personnel closer to key business partners. BOARD OF DIRECTOR CHANGES William Hagen, who was one of our founding directors, retired from Arctic Cat's board in fiscal 2007. We are grateful for his many years of dedicated service and countless contributions, and we wish him well. We also welcomed incoming board member David A. Roberts, who serves as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Carlisle Companies. David brings tremendous global, diversified manufacturing expertise that will serve Arctic Cat's shareholders well, as we seek to expand our presence in the power sports industry in North America and internationally. Arctic Cat currently has eight board members, of which the majority are independent directors. FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM RESULTS Although we anticipate that the year ahead will be challenging, we remain excited about Arctic Cat's significant opportunities for growth and efficiency. Going forward, we expect continued strong revenue gains in our ATV business in fiscal 2008 and beyond, driven by the Prowler, new model introductions and increasing international ATV sales. With our international ATV distribution network now in place, we expect strong double-digit international growth in fiscal 2008. We also expect to modestly and profitably grow our snowmobile business, after a one-time production adjustment this fiscal year. As a result of this action, however, we are expecting lower net sales in the range of $710 million to $736 million in fiscal 2008. Yet, the company is well-positioned to gain further market share across our businesses, as we did in fiscal 2007. Arctic Cat will continue to offer the best-in-class products that our customers want and that we are passionately committed to delivering. And we are confident that the strategic initiatives underway will generate increased revenues, improved profitability and greater shareholder value for the long-term. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Sincerely, /s/ Christopher A. Twomey CHRISTOPHER A.

[PHOTO] GAINING ATV MARKET SHARE BY OFFERING THE BEST ATVS Since 1996, Arctic Cat's sales have continually outpaced the growth of the ATV industry and we've gained market share. Contributing to our recent growth is our acclaimed Prowler(R) UTV, a multi-purpose, side-by-side performance utility vehicle. A quieter 2008 model Prowler is available with a 650 H1 engine or the new 700 H1 engine, both manufactured by Arctic Cat at our new state-of-the-art facility in St. Cloud, Minn. Our comprehensive line of ATVs also includes the all-new Thundercat(R) 1000, which is the most powerful ATV ever built and features the new H2 engine from Arctic Cat. Regardless of size, Arctic Cat's ATVs continue to offer best-in-class suspension travel, ground clearance, rack and fuel capacity, and towing power, as well as outstanding performance, style and versatility.

THE LEADER IN SNOW INNOVATION Our exciting new 2008 model snowmobile line-up builds on our legacy of snowmobile innovation. We've completely revamped our line-up within the past two years in order to offer riders even greater power, comfort, performance handling and fuel efficiency than ever before. Our award-winning sleds offer many industry "firsts," such as our introduction of the Twin Spar Chassis, which places riders in an ideal, ergonomic position. This new chassis is the backbone of our F Series, Jaguar and Touring sleds. Our snowmobiles also offer industry-leading features such as adjustable seats, handlebars and footrests, push-button reverse, and heated seats, just to name a few.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., July 25  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $87.9 million for the fiscal 2008 first quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared to $96.4 million for the same period last year. The net loss for the quarter was $7.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
"Our results were impacted by our previously announced plan to reduce snowmobile production by 30 percent this fiscal year, beginning in our first quarter. Despite this action, sales and earnings were slightly better than anticipated due to increased sales of ATV-related parts and accessories," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "During the quarter, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic initiatives in order to better position the company for future growth and profitability."
In May, the company announced three strategic initiatives for fiscal 2008:
A 30 percent reduction in its snowmobile production this fiscal year, as well as a shift in ATV shipment to future quarters, in order to better align dealer inventory levels with anticipated consumer demand;
                 
Reorganization of its ATV, snowmobile, and parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) product lines into three separate business units, to be led by general managers focused on expanding each business; and
                 
Relocation of the company's headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to the Minneapolis area in the fall of 2007. The company's manufacturing operations will remain in their existing locations and are not affected.
                 
During the 2008 first quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 141,000 shares of its common stock, leaving $8.6 million remaining under the company's board-authorized $20 million share repurchase program.
Review of Results
Arctic Cat reported all-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales declined 1 percent to $59.7 million in the 2008 first quarter versus $60.2 million in the same period last year, due to a previously announced shift in the timing of ATV shipments to dealers.
Thundercat 1000 ATV, which offers the most powerful, largest displacement ATV engine in the industry. The Thundercat 1000 features the new H2 engine manufactured exclusively by Arctic Cat at its newly opened engine manufacturing facility.
In June, Arctic Cat unveiled its 2008 model year ATVs to dealers, including the brand new
"We built our new facility, which just began full production last quarter, to strategically position us as first-to-market with the engines consumers want. Having the capability to manufacture our own ATV engines also enables us to increase our operational efficiency, profitability and manufacturing flexibility," commented Twomey.
sets a new benchmark for power, and our dealers' enthusiastic response to it has exceeded our own expectations."
"Our Thundercat ATV exemplifies the innovative, technology-leading engines that Arctic Cat's new engine facility can now make that are not available any place else in the market," Twomey said.  "It
Arctic Cat is expanding the number of engine models it produces, adding new ATV engines to the company's model line during fiscal 2008. In addition to the Thundercat 1000, the company introduced a quieter, 2008 model Prowler UTV utility vehicle with a larger displacement engine, as well as, a value-priced mid range 366cc model.
Arctic Cat also is setting new standards with its new 700 Diesel Super Duty model, the industry's first biodiesel-compatible ATV. This machine reflects the company's stewardship goal to be an environmental leader in all of its markets. It meets all federal and California emissions regulations and is up to 50 percent more fuel efficient than comparably powered gas ATVs. The 700 Diesel is ideally suited for use with Arctic Cat's line of SPEEDPoint farming and landscaping attachments, making the machine highly functional and versatile across a broad range of applications.
.
Arctic Cat expects ATV growth to be driven by continued strong sales of the Prowler UTV, the introduction of new, industry-leading ATV products and increased international penetration
As anticipated, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales were $11.9 million in the 2008 first quarter compared to $20.9 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the previously announced, 30 percent reduction in snowmobile production in fiscal 2008. Arctic Cat has taken this action

because a lack of snowfall for 10 consecutive years in various regions of North America has led to lower industrywide, retail snowmobile sales and slightly higher dealer inventories.
"We decided to ask those dealers with increased inventories to order fewer units in 2008, in order to bring their inventories in line with demand" said Twomey. "After inventories decline this year, we expect dealers to increase their snowmobile orders modestly next year."
With its 2008 model introductions, nearly all of Arctic Cat's snowmobile models are new within the last two years. "The newness of our entire snowmobile line-up means that even our dealer's carryover inventory is fresh and should sell well this winter with snow," said Twomey.
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales grew 6 percent to $16.3 million versus $15.4 million in the year-ago period. PG&A benefited primarily from ATV parts and accessories sales.
"We believe the ATV accessory market offers significant opportunities for future growth and we plan to concentrate on further building our PG&A business in the ATV market," said Twomey. "We also know that snow-related PG&A products can substantially enhance sales when our customers see snow."
Outlook
As a result of Arctic Cat's planned initiatives in fiscal 2008 to improve its future profitability and growth prospects, the company continues to expect net sales for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, to be in the range of $710 million to $736 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.95
.
"This year, we anticipate that our revenues and earnings will be weighted more toward the second half of the fiscal year compared to previous years, as we produce and ship fewer snowmobiles during our June through December quarters, and fewer ATVs during our first two quarters," Twomey said.
For its fiscal 2008 second-quarter ending September 30, 2007, Arctic Cat expects net sales to range between $190 million and $210 million compared to $285.3 million for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter are estimated to be between $0.52 and $0.60 per diluted share.

The 2007 Stock Plan serves as the successor to each of the Company's 1995 Stock Plan and the Company's 2002 Stock Plan, the Company's only other equity incentive plans, and no further grants shall be made under either the 1995 Stock Plan or the 2002 Stock Plan.
The 2007 Stock Plan is described in detail in the Company's 2007 proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 2, 2007 in connection with the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on August 8, 2007.

Except as otherwise provided in an Award or as provided in the next sentence, if a Change in Control occurs, and if the agreements effectuating the Change in Control do not provide for the assumption or substitution of all Awards granted under this Plan, with respect to any Award granted under this Plan that is not so assumed or substituted (a "Non-Assumed Award"), such Awards shall immediately vest and be exercisable and any restrictions thereon shall lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee determines at or prior to the Change in Control, no Award that is subject to any Performance Goal for which the performance period has not expired, shall accelerate at the time of a Change in Control.
(c)
          
Vesting Upon a Change in Control
. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may, with respect to any or all of such Non-Assumed Awards, take any or all of the following actions to be effective as of the date of the Change in Control (or as of any other date fixed by the Committee occurring within the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the date of the Change in Control, but only if such action remains contingent upon the effectuation of the Change in Control) (such date referred to as the "Action Effective Date"):

Disposition of Awards
Unilaterally cancel such Non-Assumed Award in exchange for: (x) whole and/or fractional Shares (or for whole Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional Share) or whole and/or fractional shares of a successor (or for whole shares of a successor and cash in lieu of any fractional share) that, in the aggregate, are equal in value to the Fair Market Value of: (I) in the case of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, the Shares that could be purchased subject to such Non-Assumed Award less the aggregate exercise price for the Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to such Shares; (II) in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards and Other Stock Grants, Shares subject to such Award determined as of the Action Effective Date (taking into account vesting), less the value of any consideration payable on exercise; or (y) cash or other property equal in value to the Fair Market Value of (I) in the case of Options or

Stock Appreciation Rights, the Shares that could be purchased subject to such Non-Assumed Award less the aggregate exercise price for the Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to such Shares or (II) in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Awards and Other Stock Grants, Shares subject to such Award determined as of the Action Effective Date (taking into account vesting) less the value of any consideration payable on exercise.
In the case of Options, unilaterally cancel such Non-Assumed Option after providing the holder of such Option with (1) an opportunity to exercise such Non-Assumed Option to the extent vested within a specified period prior to the date of the Change in Control, and (2) notice of such opportunity to exercise prior to the commencement of such specified period.
(ii)
          
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Award Agreement or the Plan, with respect to any Non-Assumed Awards after satisfaction of one of the foregoing, the Participant will only be entitled to the cash or other property and shall not have any right to the Shares or any shares of the successor.
(iii)
         
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the recipient of a Non-Assumed Award is an Insider, payment of cash in lieu of whole or fractional Shares or shares of a successor may only be made to the extent that such payment (A) has met the requirements of an exemption under Rule 16b-3, or (B) is a subsequent transaction the terms of which were provided for in a transaction initially meeting the requirements of an exemption under Rule 16b-3. Unless an Award Agreement provides otherwise, the payment of cash in lieu of whole or fractional Shares or in lieu of whole or fractional shares of a successor shall be considered a subsequent transaction approved by the original grant of an Option.
.  If a Change in Control occurs, then, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Award Agreement pertaining to a particular Award or as otherwise provided in this Plan, each Award shall be governed by applicable law and the documents effectuating the Change in Control.

General Rule for Awards
Section 15.
Income Tax Compliance
           
In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant, are withheld or collected from such Participant.  In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax obligation by (i) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes, provided that the maximum amount shall not exceed the amount of the required withholding, or (ii) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise
(a)

or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes.
"Deferred Compensation" means any Stock Incentive under this Plan that provides for the "deferral of compensation" under a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as those terms are defined under Code Section 409A) and that would be subject to the taxes specified in Code Section 409A(a)(1) if and to the extent that the Plan and the Award Agreement do not meet or are not operated in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, Deferred Compensation shall not include any amount that is otherwise exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(b)
          
"Specified Employee" means a Participant who is a key employee as described in Code Section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii) and (iii) (and disregarding paragraph (5) thereof) at any time during the 12 months ending on each December 31, beginning December 31, 2007, or such other "identification date" that applies consistently for all plans that provide "deferred compensation" that is subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Each Participant will be identified as a Specified Employee in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A, including with respect to the spin-off or merger of the company with any other company, and such identification shall apply for the twelve (12) month period commencing on the first day of the fourth month following the identification date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant shall be a Specified Employee unless the stock of the Company (or other member of a "controlled group of corporations" as determined under Code Section 1563) is publicly traded on an established securities market as of the date of a Participant's "separation from service" as defined in Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(c)
          
Except to the extent such acceleration or deferral is permitted or complies with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder, neither the Committee nor a Participant may accelerate or defer the time or schedule of any payment of, or the amount scheduled to be paid under, an Award that constitutes Deferred Compensation; , , that payment shall be permitted if it is in accordance with a fixed date or schedule or on account of "separation from service," "disability, " death, "change in control" or "unforeseeable emergency" as those items are defined under Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(d)
          
provided
however
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise, the Committee may not make payment to a Specified Employee of any Award that constitutes Deferred Compensation earlier than six (6) months following the Participant's "separation from service" as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A (or if earlier, upon the Specified Employee's death), except as permitted under Code Section 409A.  Any payments that otherwise would be payable to the Specified Employee during the foregoing six (6) month period will be accumulated and payment will be delayed until the first date after the six (6) month period.  The Committee may specify in the Award Agreement that the amount of the Deferred Compensation delayed shall accumulate interest or earnings during the period of such delay.
(e)
          
17
The Committee may reform any provision in an Award intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provisions without violating the provisions of Code Section 409A and to preserve the economic benefits intended by the Award.
(f)
           
Dividend and Dividend Equivalents.  The Committee may grant dividend or dividend equivalents to any Participant and shall determine the time and manner of payment of the dividend or dividend equivalent; , , that any dividend equivalent that is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code shall be stated as a separate arrangement.

Amendments and Termination
           
The Board may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration, or discontinuation shall be made (i) which would impair the rights of a Participant under an Award theretofore granted, without the Participant's consent, or (ii) which without the approval of the shareholders of the Company would cause the Plan to no longer comply with Rule 16b-3, Section 422 of the Code or any other regulatory requirements or (iii) without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, which would result in a repricing of any Award theretofore granted hereunder.  Further, Section 6(d) shall not be amended more than once every six (6) months, other than to comport with changes in the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder.
(a)
          
The Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Section 3 above or as otherwise provided in this Plan, no such amendment shall impair the rights of any Participant without his or her consent.
(b)
          
The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan.

Section 17.
           
Trust or Fund Created
No
Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and an Eligible Person or any other Person.  To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.  In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards granted hereunder; , , that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.

.  Except with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Awards as to which the Participant has been granted the right to vote, neither a Participant nor the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable to such Participant upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until such Shares have been issued.
(d)
          
No Rights of Shareholders
.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
(e)
          
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
.  The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, or a Director to be retained as a Director, or as a Consultant to be retained as a Consultant, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 24, 2007
 
ARCTIC CAT REPORTS RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2008 SECOND QUARTER
 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Oct. 24  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported
net sales of $205.2 million for the fiscal 2008 second quarter ended September 30, 2007, compared with $285.3 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter were $13.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, versus $20.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, a year ago.
For the six months ended September 30, 2007, net sales were $293.1 million compared with $381.7 million in the first six months of last fiscal year. Net earnings were $6.8 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $15.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the prior-year first half.
"Our revenues were in line with our guidance and earnings were above our expectations, due to the timing of parts, garments and accessory shipments and better margins than anticipated. We continue to adjust our fiscal 2008 production levels to reduce dealer inventory and align it with anticipated consumer demand this year," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "At the same time, we are committed to further enhancing our lean manufacturing and strategic sourcing capabilities. We made progress on our 2008 strategic initiatives during the quarter, in order to position the company for improved growth and profitability in the future." The initiatives are:
 - 
                 
A 30 percent reduction in snowmobile production this fiscal year, as well as a shift in ATV shipments to future quarters, in order to better match dealer inventory levels with expected consumer demand;
 - 
                 
Reorganization of the all-terrain vehicle (ATV), snowmobile, and parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) product lines into three separate business units, to be led by general managers focused on expanding each business; and
 - 
              Relocation of the company's headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to the Minneapolis area early in the 2008 calendar year. The company's core manufacturing operations will remain in Thief River Falls, Minn., and will not be affected.
Arctic Cat anticipates that it will announce its reorganized structure and headquarters location in its fiscal third quarter, ending December 31, 2007.
On September 26, 2007, Arctic Cat announced plans to sell its facility in Madison, S.D., and consolidate those painting, welding and subassembly operations into its Thief River Falls plant. This action enables the company to leverage its efficiency and is expected to save approximately $1 million a year in operational costs.
During the 2008 second quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 317,000 shares of its common stock, leaving $2.4 million remaining under the company's board-authorized $20 million share repurchase program.
 
Review of Results
Arctic Cat reported ATV sales of $77.5 million in the 2008 second quarter versus $133.8 million in the same period last year. ATV sales in the six months totaled $137.3 million compared with $194.0 million in the prior-year six months. ATV sales for both the fiscal 2008 second quarter and six months were impacted by previously announced lower production levels and a shift in ATV shipments to future quarters when the company's new models will be available.
"Although we've adjusted our ATV production schedule to realistically reflect the current market, we continued to see strong interest in several of our innovative, new ATV models,"
said Twomey. These 2008 models include
the
Thundercat 1000 ATV, a quieter Prowler UTV utility vehicle with a larger displacement engine, a 700 H1 EFI model and a value-priced, mid-range 366cc model.
Arctic Cat's Thundercat 1000 ATV offers the most powerful, largest displacement ATV engine in the industry. It features the new H2 engine manufactured exclusively by Arctic Cat at its engine manufacturing facility.
In addition, the company's 700 Diesel Super Duty model offers the industry's first biodiesel-compatible ATV. This machine, which reflects the company's stewardship goal to be an environmental leader, meets all federal and California emissions regulations and is up to 50 percent more fuel efficient than comparably powered gas ATVs. The 700 Diesel is ideally suited for use with Arctic Cat's line of SPEEDPoint farming and landscaping attachments, making the machine highly functional and versatile across a broad range of applications.
Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales were $97.0 million in the 2008 second quarter compared with $121.5 million in the prior-year quarter. In the six months ended September 30, 2007, snowmobile sales totaled $108.9 million versus $142.4 million in the first six months of last year. Snowmobile sales in the fiscal 2008 second quarter and six months declined primarily due to the previously announced, 30 percent reduction in snowmobile production in fiscal 2008. Arctic Cat has taken this action because a lack of snowfall for 10 consecutive years in various regions of North America has led to lower industrywide, retail snowmobile sales and slightly higher dealer inventories. After an inventory adjustment this fiscal year, the company anticipates that dealers will modestly increase their snowmobile orders next fiscal year.
PG&A sales grew to $30.6 million in the 2008 second quarter versus $30.0 million in the year-ago period. For the six months, PG&A sales rose to $46.9 million compared with $45.3 million in the same period last year. PG&A benefited primarily from the timing of shipments.
 
Outlook
                Arctic Cat has previously stated that it anticipates its revenues and earnings will be weighted more toward the second half of the 2008 fiscal year compared to previous years, as it produced and shipped fewer ATVs during its first two quarters, and fewer snowmobiles during the June through December quarters. The company also has stated that it expects to record a charge of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share in its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2008, related to the Madison, S.D., facility consolidation.
                As a result of Arctic Cat's planned initiatives in fiscal 2008 to leverage its efficiency, and improve its future profitability and growth prospects, the company continues to expect net sales for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, to be in the range of $710 million to $736 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.95
.
                For its fiscal 2008 third quarter ending December 31, 2007, Arctic Cat expects net sales to range between $170 million and $180 million compared with $228.1 million for the same period last year. Net loss for the quarter is estimated to be between $0.30 and $0.37 per diluted share.  The net loss for the quarter results primarily from the previously discussed reduction in snowmobile production.

Item 5.03   Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On December 13, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company amended Article V of the Company's Bylaws to allow the Company's shares to be either certificated or uncertificated. This change was required in order for the Company to be eligible to participate in the Direct Registration System, which allows shareholders to have shares registered in their names without the issuance of physical certificates, as well as electronically transfer securities to broker-dealers in order to effect transactions without the risks and delays associated with transferring physical certificates.
 
A copy of Article V of the Company's Bylaws, in its entirety as amended, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Press release issued on January 4, 2008 revising the Registrant's sales and earnings outlook for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007 and full fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 and announcing a $10 million share repurchase authorization.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
                THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Jan. 4, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today revised its sales and earnings outlook for the fiscal 2008 third quarter ended December 31, 2007, due to lower than anticipated sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).  As a result, third-quarter net sales are now estimated at $155 million to $160 million compared to a record $228.1 million in the prior-year third quarter, and versus the company's earlier forecast of $170 million to $180 million.
 
                Arctic Cat expects a third-quarter net loss of $0.55 to $0.60 per diluted share. The company had earlier estimated a 2008 third-quarter net loss of between $0.30 and $0.37 per diluted share, primarily due to the previously disclosed reduction in snowmobile production during the current fiscal year. In the third quarter last year, Arctic Cat posted earnings per diluted share of $0.43, which included
an income tax benefit of $0.03 per diluted share.
 
                Arctic Cat now anticipates sales for the full year ending March 31, 2008, to be in the range of $645 million to $665 million, compared with record net sales in fiscal 2007 of $782.4 million. Earnings per diluted share for the 2008 fiscal year are now estimated to be between $0.01 and $0.07 versus year-ago diluted earnings per share of $1.15. The company previously estimated net sales for the current fiscal year to be in the range of $710 million to $736 million, with full-year diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $0.95.
 
               
"After reporting seven consecutive years of record sales, we are disappointed with these results and the sluggish ATV environment," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer.  "Our preliminary third-quarter results indicate that while retail sales of Arctic Cat ATVs were in line with the overall ATV marketplace, retail sales of ATVs industrywide continued a year-long decline. Sales of Arctic Cat's snowmobiles remain on plan, while sales of our snow-related parts, garments and accessories are above plan, due to December snow accumulations in key regions."
 
 
                The industrywide retail ATV sales slowdown has affected all segments of the market, except the large-displacement engine segment, which has shown modest gains. Arctic Cat's results mirror these trends, showing lower sales of ATVs with engines under 650cc's but continued demand for the company's large-displacement ATVs and Prowler utility vehicle.
 
                In light of the current overall industry environment, Arctic Cat is taking steps to produce fewer ATV units in its March quarter. The company plans to cut its annual ATV production by approximately 10 percent during the fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2008. "This action is in keeping with our aim to vigilantly align production and inventory with consumer demand," said Twomey.
 
                "Arctic Cat remains in a strong financial position, with no long-term debt," Twomey said.  
 
                The company expects to report its actual fiscal 2008 third-quarter results on January 23, 2008.
 
New $10 Million Share Repurchase Authorized
 
Arctic Cat's board of directors has authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $10 million of its common stock. The company has bought back more than 12 million common shares since 1996.
 
"This share repurchase program supports the company's commitment to increase shareholder value and reflects our belief that the stock represents a good investment," said Twomey.
 
Share repurchases under this program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The timing of share repurchases will depend on market conditions and other corporate considerations. Arctic Cat has approximately 17.9 million common and Class B common shares outstanding.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., Jan. 23, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales of $159.6 million for the fiscal 2008 third quarter ended December 31, 2007, compared to a record $228.1 million in the same period last year. The net loss for the quarter was $10.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, versus prior-year third quarter net earnings of $8.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, which included an income tax benefit of $0.03 per diluted share.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, Arctic Cat's net sales were $452.7 million compared to $609.9 million in the same period last year. The company reported a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $23.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, in the nine-month period last year.
 
                Commented Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer:
"We are disappointed in the company's performance. After seven years of record growth, we anticipated that fiscal 2008 would be a difficult year when we took strategic action to reduce dealers' snowmobile inventories. Compounding this was an industrywide challenging retail ATV market, which continued to deteriorate through the third quarter. We remain committed to aligning inventories with demand, leveraging our efficiency and strategic sourcing initiative, and maintaining our competitiveness and technology leadership through innovative new products and features."
 
               
During the quarter, Arctic Cat repurchased approximately 166,000 shares under its stock repurchase program. In addition, the company announced on January 4, 2008, that its
board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $10 million of its common stock. Arctic Cat has approximately 17.9 million common and Class B common shares outstanding.
 
Product Line Results
Sales of Arctic Cat's snowmobiles were $60.0 million in the 2008 third quarter versus $106.4 million in the
same period last year, r
eflecting the company's planned reduction in
 
snowmobile production during the current fiscal year. Early season snowfall in key regions during December generated strong retail snowmobile sales and, combined with the company's planned lower snowmobile production in its current fiscal year, helped reduce dealer inventories. Arctic Cat's year-to-date snowmobile sales totaled $168.9 million compared to $248.8 million in the prior-year period.
 
Sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs totaled
$70.1 million versus $91.8 million in
the prior-year third quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales were $207.4 million compared to $285.8 million in the first nine months of last fiscal year. Arctic Cat's Prowler utility vehicle and ATVs with large-displacement engines continued to be strong contributors to the company's ATV business. As announced on January 4, 2008, due to the industry's sluggish retail ATV sales, Arctic Cat has reduced its planned ATV production for fiscal 2008 in order to align dealer inventories with demand.
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales were essentially flat at $29.5 million compared to $29.9 million in the prior-year third quarter. During the quarter, snowmobile PG&A sales increased as a result of early season snowfalls, offsetting a decline in ATV PG&A sales. Year-to-date PG&A sales totaled $76.4 million versus $75.3 million in the year-ago period, primarily fueled by increased snowmobile parts and accessories sales.
 
Outlook
 
                As previously announced, Arctic Cat lowered its fiscal 2008 production of snowmobiles by approximately 30 percent and ATVs by approximately 10 percent, aligning dealer inventory with consumer demand.
 
Arctic Cat anticipates increased fiscal 2008 fourth-quarter net sales for the period ending March 31, 2008, to range from $192 million to $212 million, compared to $172.6 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to planned fourth-quarter ATV sales to dealers. Net earnings in the fourth quarter are estimated to be between $0.21 and $0.25 per diluted share. The company reported a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.
 
                Arctic Cat expects sales for the full year ending March 31, 2008, to be in the range of $645 million to $665 million, compared with record net sales in fiscal 2007 of $782.4 million. Earnings per diluted share for the 2008 fiscal year are now estimated to be between $0.01 and $0.05 versus year-ago diluted earnings per share of $1.15.

3.
            
Withholding of Tax
.  To the extent that the receipt of the Restricted Shares or the lapse of any Forfeiture Restrictions results in income to Employee for federal or state income tax purposes, Employee shall deliver to the Company at the time of such receipt or lapse, as the case may be, such amount of money or shares of unrestricted Stock as the Company may require to meet its withholding obligation under applicable tax laws or regulations, and, if Employee fails to do so, the Company is authorized to withhold from any cash or Stock remuneration then or thereafter payable to Employee any tax required to be withheld by reason of such resulting compensation income.
 
4.

Employee also agrees (i) that the certificates representing the Restricted Shares may bear such legend or legends as the Company deems appropriate in order to assure compliance with applicable securities laws, (ii) that the Company may refuse to register the transfer of the Restricted Shares on the stock transfer records of the Company if such proposed transfer would be in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company constitute a violation of any applicable securities law and (iii) that the Company may give related instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of the Restricted Shares.

2.
            
Exercise of the SSAR
.
 
(a).  The SSAR may be exercised, in whole or in part, upon vesting in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 2 and during the term set forth in Paragraph 6.  Upon exercise, Employee shall be entitled to receive from the Company a number of shares of the Common Stock with an aggregate market value on the date of exercise equal to the product of: (A) the number of shares in respect of which the SSAR is being exercised, multiplied by (B) the excess of (i) the Market Price of one share of the Common Stock on the date or dates of exercise, over (ii) the Grant Price;
          
Right to Exercise
provided,
 
 
however,
that the maximum amount of this clause (B) shall be Ten Dollars ($10.00).  Fractional shares of the Common Stock shall be paid in cash based on the Market Price on the date of exercise.
 
(b)           .  The SSAR herein granted shall be exercisable at such time as trading of the Company's shares of Common Stock have a Market Price equal to or greater than          and     /100 Dollars ($        ) for thirty (30) of the preceding forty (40) trading days; , in no event shall the SSAR be exercisable earlier than one (1) year from the Effective Date of this Agreement.
Vesting

(c).  The SSAR shall be exercisable by written notice which shall state the election to exercise the SSAR and the number of shares in respect of which the SSAR is being exercised, and such other representations and agreements as to the holder's investment intent with respect to the shares to be issued as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Stock Plan.  Such written notice shall be signed by Employee and shall be delivered in person or by certified mail to the Secretary of the Company.  The certificate or certificates for the shares as to which the SSAR shall have been so exercised shall be registered in the name of Employee, or if Employee so elects, in the name of Employee or one other person as joint tenants, and shall be delivered as soon as practicable after the notice shall have been received.  In the event the SSAR shall be exercised by any person other than Employee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person to exercise the SSAR.  The shares issued upon exercise of the SSAR as provided herein shall be fully paid and nonassessable.
          
Method of Exercise
 
(d).  No shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of the SSAR unless such issuance and such exercise shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed.  Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes, the shares shall be considered transferred to Employee on the date on which the SSAR is exercised with respect to such shares.
          
Restriction on Exercise
 
3..  The number of shares subject to the SSAR herein granted or the Grant Price are subject to adjustment by the Company's Board of Directors in the event of an increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of the Common Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of the Common Stock or the payment of a stock dividend on the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of the Common Stock effected without receipt or payment of consideration by the Company.
            
Adjustment
 
4..  Until stock certificates are issued to Employee, neither Employee nor any beneficiary or transferee thereof shall have any rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company with respect to the shares issuable upon conversion of the SSAR.  Except as expressly provided in Paragraph 3 or in the Plan, no adjustment to the SSAR shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date the certificates representing such shares are issued.
            
No Rights of Shareholder
 
 
5.             .  This SSAR may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Employee only by Employee.  More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the SSAR may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above), pledged, or hypothecated in any way; shall not be assignable by operation of law; and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition of the SSAR contrary to the provisions hereof, and the levy of any execution, attachment, or similar process upon the SSAR, shall be null and void and without effect.  The terms of the SSAR shall be binding upon Employee and his or her personal representative, heirs, successors and assigns.

6.             .  This SSAR shall immediately terminate on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Grant Date and be of no further force and effect.

8.             .  In the event the employment of Employee shall be terminated for any reason whatsoever, the SSAR may be exercised by Employee at any time (i) until the date twelve (12) months after the date the SSAR becomes vested or the date of Retirement (as defined in the 2007 Stock Plan), whichever is later, if such termination was by reason of Retirement, (ii) within one (1) month after such termination if such termination was for any reason other than Retirement, Cause (as defined in the 2007 Stock Plan) or as provided in paragraph 9 hereof, and (iii) no later than the date of termination if such termination was for Cause; that in no event may the SSAR be exercised later than the expiration of the term specified in paragraph 6.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in writing after the date of this Agreement, (A) upon termination by reason of Retirement, the SSAR will continue to vest in accordance with its terms, and (B) upon termination for any reason other than Retirement, the SSAR shall be exercisable only to the extent Employee shall have been entitled to do so at the date of his or her termination of employment.  So long as Employee shall continue to be an employee of the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries, the SSAR shall not be affected by any change of duties or position.  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any such subsidiary to terminate the employment of Employee at any time.
Termination of Employment Relationship
provided, however,
 
9.               If Employee shall die while still employed by the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries, or shall become permanently and totally disabled (as determined by the Committee) while still employed by the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries, the SSAR may be exercised (to the extent that Employee shall have been entitled to do so at the date of his or her death or termination by reason of permanent and total disability, unless otherwise determined by the Committee

10.           .  The existence of the SSAR herein granted shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its shareholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Common Stock or its rights thereof, or dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
                THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., April 8, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today
revised its sales and earnings outlook for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008, on lower than anticipated all-terrain vehicles (ATV) sales, which the company attributed to three factors: continued weak retail sales; the reduction of a planned, large retail customer order; and a parts supply issue.
 
                "The headwind we saw in the retail ATV market at the end of calendar year 2007 continued to worsen in the first quarter of calendar 2008," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer, "causing lower than anticipated wholesale sales to our dealers." Twomey noted that Arctic Cat gained ATV market share during the March quarter, but industrywide ATV retail sales continued to decline which made dealers reluctant to substantially increase their inventory.
 
In addition, two other unforeseeable events occurred during the quarter, further impacting sales. One of Arctic Cat's large multi-store retailers decided to sell ATVs only in its largest footprint stores and, as a result, significantly reduced its planned order for the quarter. Arctic Cat also experienced an ATV sourcing issue with a vendor supplying parts for the Prowler utility vehicle. A temporary supply interruption occurred while Arctic Cat was in the process of transitioning to a different supplier, as part of the company's strategic sourcing initiative. The supply issue was resolved before the end of the fourth quarter, using another supplier. "Unfortunately, because of the supply uncertainty, we stopped taking Prowler orders for a period of time, reducing ATV sales in the March quarter," said Twomey.
 
                As a result of these factors, Arctic Cat's fourth-quarter net sales are now estimated to be $167 million to $169 million compared to $172.6 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Arctic Cat now expects fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share to range between breakeven to a net loss of $0.08.
                Accordingly, Arctic Cat has revised its anticipated sales for the full year ended March 31, 2008, to be in the range of $620 million to $622 million, compared with record net sales in fiscal 2007 of $782.4 million. The company anticipates reporting a net loss per diluted share for the 2008 fiscal year in the range of $0.20 to $0.28 versus year-ago diluted earnings per share of $1.15.
 
                "We are very disappointed about the significant impact of these events on the quarter," said Twomey.  The company had previously announced a reduction in fiscal 2008 production levels in response to the challenging retail climate for recreational vehicles. Twomey said that Arctic Cat continues to focus on lowering costs through its strategic sourcing initiative and leveraging its efficiency, with the aim of returning the company to profitability.
 
                Arctic Cat expects to report its actual fiscal 2008 fourth-quarter results in mid-May.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn., May 15, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported
net sales of $168.9 million for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared with net sales of $172.6 million in the same period last year. Fourth-quarter net earnings were $424,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
 
As previously announced, Arctic Cat's fiscal 2008 fourth-quarter sales and earnings were impacted by: the continued weak retail environment for all-terrain vehicles (ATVs); the reduction of a planned, large multi-store retail customer order; and an ATV parts supply issue on the Prowler utility vehicle that was resolved before the end of the fourth quarter.
 
Arctic Cat posted full-year net sales of $621.6 million compared with record net sales of $782.4 million last fiscal year. The company reported a full-year net loss of $3.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $22.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.
 
"After seven consecutive years of record sales, we are disappointed in the company's performance," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer.  "We anticipated that fiscal 2008 would be a challenging year, as we lowered our production levels to reduce dealer inventories. Our results were further impacted by macro-economic issues that weakened consumer confidence and discretionary spending."
 
Arctic Cat previously announced planned reductions in its fiscal 2008 production of ATVs and snowmobiles, in response to the difficult retail climate for recreational vehicles.
 
"We achieved our goal to significantly reduce dealer inventory levels in fiscal 2008, through planned production cuts," said Twomey. "Although recreational vehicles continue to experience a tough retail market, we believe our current dealer inventory levels will enable growth in sales to dealers in our fiscal 2009."

All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales totaled $142.9 million in the 2008 fourth quarter versus $145.8 million in the
same period last year. For fiscal 2008, Arctic Cat's ATV sales were $350.3 million compared with $431.5 million last fiscal year. ATV revenues were lower for the quarter and full year due to declining industrywide ATV retail sales and the company's previously announced 10 percent cut in its ATV production levels.
 
Snowmobile sales were a negative $7.1 million in the 2008 fourth quarter compared with a negative $1.8 million in the prior-year quarter, due to sales incentives and lower shipments.
For the 2008 fiscal year, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales totaled $161.9 million versus $247.0 million in the prior year, largely due to the company's previously announced 30 percent reduction in fiscal 2008 snowmobile production levels to align inventory with retail demand.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories
(PG&A) in the 2008 fourth quarter grew 15 percent to $33.0 million versus $28.6 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by increased sales of snow-related parts, garments and accessories. For the full fiscal year, PG&A sales rose to $109.4 million, up from $103.9 million last year, fueled by snowmobile parts, garments and accessories, as well as ATV parts and accessories.
 
Outlook
 
"We expect the company to return to profitability in fiscal 2009," said Twomey. "We are focused on achieving growth by offering innovative products that drive market share gains, and lowering costs through our strategic sourcing initiative and by further leveraging our efficiency."
 
Commenting further on Arctic Cat's fiscal 2009 outlook, Twomey said: "Following our planned, lower snowmobile production last year, to align dealer inventory with retail demand, we expect increased snowmobile revenues. We also anticipate flat to slightly higher ATV revenues, based on increased Prowler utility vehicle and international ATV sales, as well as an overall richer product mix."
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, Arctic Cat expects net sales to grow between 5 percent and 8 percent, and be in the range of $650 million to $674 million. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.28
.
 
Arctic Cat's first-quarter net sales, for the period ending June 30, 2008, are estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million versus net sales of $
87.9 million
in the same period
last year. The first-quarter net loss is estimated to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.39 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Arctic Cat
expects its fiscal 2009 first-quarter results to be negatively impacted by a lower tax benefit, caused by an estimated 13 basis point change in the company's first-quarter effective tax rate compared to the prior-year first quarter.
The company anticipates positive revenue and earnings comparisons in its second and third quarters, driven by increased snowmobile, as well as parts, garments and accessories sales.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Minneapolis, Minn., July 24, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported net sales increased 7 percent to $93.9 million for the fiscal 2009 first quarter ended June 30, 2008, from net sales of $87.9 million for the same period last year. The net loss for the quarter was $7.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
 
"Our first-quarter results benefited from the timing of shipments to dealers for snowmobiles and parts, garments and accessories," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer of Arctic Cat. "We continue to expect the company to return to profitability this fiscal year. While our markets will remain challenging, due to persistent weakness in the economy, and higher commodity prices pose some risk to our outlook, we are better positioned to attain modest growth and profitability in the year ahead, due to the strategic actions we took last fiscal year."
 
Arctic Cat's all-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales were down 10 percent to $53.8 million in the 2009 first quarter versus $59.7 million in the same period last year. In the current fiscal year, Arctic Cat anticipates that its
ATV revenues will be flat. The company does not expect core ATV retail sales to pick up until the overall economy strengthens.
 
1000  and Thundercat TRV fit nicely in this growth niche and are very competitive products."
"The growth segments of the ATV market are two-passenger utility ATVs and UTVs, as well as those with the large-displacement engines," said Twomey. "We are confident that our new Prowler XTZ 1000, Thundercat
 
During the first quarter, Arctic Cat unveiled its new 2009 model ATVs to dealers, including an extension of the Prowler UTV line. The company's new high-performance Prowler XTZ 1000 combines a side-by-side with an Arctic Cat-engineered 1000cc engine, making it the most powerful UTV available in the industry. New 2009 model Prowlers also are available in different engine sizes and with options such as a flatbed or big cargo box, a fully enclosed cab and customizable accessories.

Snowmobile sales increased 80 percent to $21.4 million, up from $11.9 million in the prior-year first quarter, due to the timing of shipments. "We are encouraged to see the generally high level of enthusiasm for our snowmobile business from dealers and customers," Twomey said.
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's new 2009 model line-up is a 177 horsepower turbocharged four-stroke engine, which is offered in several 2009 models. This is the largest horsepower engine in the snowmobile industry and currently exceeds 2012 EPA emissions standards. In addition, the company's mountain machines continue to be among the lightest and most powerful, and its utility line of snowmobiles, particularly important in the Canadian market, has been completely redesigned on the F3 chassis.
 
"Consolidating the number of chassis platforms is a result of our lean initiative to reduce design and manufacturing costs and improve margins, while offering customers exciting new, best-in-class products," said Twomey.
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales grew 15 percent to $18.7 million versus $16.3 million in the year-ago period. PG&A benefited from both ATV- and snowmobile-related sales. New products and lower dealer inventories generated increased orders.
 
"We are optimistic that we will continue to grow PG&A sales, with additional focus and attention under our new leadership for this business," said Twomey.
 
Outlook
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, Arctic Cat expects net sales to grow between 5 percent and 8 percent, and be in the range of $650 million to $674 million, based on increased snowmobile revenues,  anticipated ATV revenues, and a better overall product mix. Full-year diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.28.
 
Arctic Cat
remains focused on achieving growth by offering innovative products that drive market share gains, lowering costs through its strategic sourcing initiative and by further leveraging its efficiency. The company expects to save approximately $5 million to $6 million in fiscal 2009 through its strategic sourcing initiatives, although these savings will be partially offset by higher commodity prices.
 
Arctic Cat's second-quarter net sales, for the period ending September 30, 2008, are estimated to be in the range of $189 million to $199 million versus net sales of $205.2 million in the same period
last year. The second-quarter net earnings is estimated to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share versus net earnings of
$13.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share,
in the prior-year quarter.

In addition, Mr. Jordan will have specific responsibility for all operations and departments of the Company except product validation and the Chief Financial Officer (together with functions currently reporting to the Chief Financial Officer).
 
                Before joining the Company, Mr. Jordan served from 2003 to 2008 as Vice President of The Home Depot and President of THD At-Home Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Home Depot, and, prior to that time, held senior leadership positions at General Electric Company from 1998 to 2003, serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of its GE Water Technologies business unit and Manager, Business Development of GE Power Systems.  From 1993 to 1997, Mr. Jordan held management and executive positions with Memtec Limited, a global material sciences based purification and separation business.

(iv)          if a change in control otherwise occurs which would be required to be reported in response to the current Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.
 
3.             . If a Change in Control shall have occurred and Executive is thereafter terminated while this Agreement is in effect, Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in subsection 4(d) unless such termination is (A) because of Executive's death, (B) by the Company for Cause or Disability, or (C) by Executive other than for Good Reason.
Termination Following Change in Control
 
(a)           .  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Disability" shall have two different meanings.  For purposes of benefits due under any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy (whether short-term, long-term, or any applicable salary continuation policy provided during any elimination period), the definition of Disability shall conform to the definition provided in such policy.   For purposes of any payment made to Executive in excess of the benefits due under any such Company-sponsored disability insurance policy, the definition of Disability shall be at least as restrictive as the applicable definition provided in Code Section 409A.  The Executive's employment shall terminate upon the Disability of the Executive unless waived by the Company, where the definition of Disability shall conform to the definition of disability set forth in any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy.
Disability
 
 
(b)           .  For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to immediately terminate the employment of Executive for "Cause" if the Executive shall:
Cause
 
(i)            Willfully or materially breach this Agreement or continually fail to perform the duties that the Executive is required to perform under the terms of this Agreement;
 
(ii)           Willfully violate other reasonable and substantial rules governing Executive performance, including, without limitation, prohibitions against unauthorized use of drugs or alcohol without treatment;
 
(iii)          Violate or willfully refuse to obey  reasonable instructions of the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Board of Directors, that such instructions are not in violation of this Agreement;
provided
 
(iv)          Willfully engage in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise;
 
(v)           In the performance of Executive's duties under this Agreement, engage in any act of misconduct, including misconduct involving moral turpitude, which is injurious to the Company; or
 
(vi)          Be convicted of or plead guilty to any criminal charge or indictment, the nature of which the Company determines, in its sole discretion, has a detrimental impact on the general reputation of the Company.
 
An act or failure to act is considered "willful" if done or not done with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that the act or failure to act was in the best interests of the Company. In the event of termination for "Cause", Executive shall not be entitled to any severance payments or any other payments under this Agreement. Executive shall not be terminated for Cause unless and until the Company shall have delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive's conduct was Cause and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
(c)           . Executive shall be entitled to terminate his or her employment for Good Reason following a Change in Control, and in such case shall be entitled to the benefits provided in subsection 4(d) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean, without Executive's express written consent, any of the following:
Good Reason
 
(i)            the authority, powers, functions, responsibilities or duties assigned to Executive, as compared to those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, are materially and adversely diminished (except for any diminution that occurs solely as a result of the fact that the Company ceases to be a public company);
 
(ii)           a reduction by the Company in Executive's annual base salary in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control;
 
(iii)          the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location more than twenty-five miles from Thief River Falls, Minnesota, or from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota or the Company requiring Executive to be based anywhere other than the Company's principal executive offices except for requiring travel on the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with Executive's business travel obligations prior to the Change in Control;
 
(iv)          the failure by the Company to continue to provide Executive with benefits at least as favorable to those enjoyed by Executive under any of the Company's pension, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability, deferred compensation, incentive awards, bonus, stock options, or savings plans in which Executive was participating immediately prior to the Change in Control, the taking of any action by the Company which would directly or indirectly
 
 
materially reduce any of such benefits or deprive Executive of any material fringe benefit enjoyed immediately prior to the Change in Control, or the failure by the Company to provide Executive with the number of paid vacation or sick days to which Executive is entitled immediately prior to the Change in Control, provided, however, that the Company may amend any such plan or programs as long as such amendments do not reduce any benefits to which Executive would be entitled;
 
(v)           the failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in Section 8;
 
(vi)          the taking of any action by the Company that would materially adversely affect the physical conditions existing at the time of the Change in Control in or under which Executive performs his employment duties;
 
(vii)         any material breach of this Agreement by the Company; or
 
(viii)        any purported termination of Executive's employment which is not made pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of this Agreement; for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective.
 
(d)           . Any purported termination of Executive's employment by the Company or by Executive shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 7. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth a summary of the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment.
Notice of Termination
 
(e)           . For purposes of this Agreement, "Date of Termination" shall mean:
Date of Termination
 
(i)            if Executive's employment is terminated for Disability as defined by any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy, 30 days after Notice of Termination is given; and
 
(ii)           if Executive's employment is terminated pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or for any other reason (other than death or Disability), the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination pursuant to subsection (b) above shall not be less than 10 days, and in the case of a termination pursuant to subsection (c) above shall not be less than 10 nor more than 30 days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is given).
 
(f)            . If, within 10 days after any Notice of Termination is given, the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties, or by a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or the time for appeal therefrom having expired and no appeal having been perfected); provided, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence. Notwithstanding the pendency of any such dispute, the Company shall continue to pay Executive full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to, base salary and a year-end bonus in an amount at least equal to the year-end bonus paid with respect to the fiscal year immediately preceding the Change in Control) and continue Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which Executive was participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is finally resolved in accordance with this subsection. Amounts paid under this subsection are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts under this Agreement.
Dispute of Termination
 
4.             . Following a Change in Control, upon termination of Executive's employment or during a period of Disability, Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits:
Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability
 
(a)           During any period that Executive fails to perform full-time duties with the Company as a result of a Disability as defined by any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy, the Company shall
 
 
pay Executive the base salary of Executive at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period plus a pro rata portion of an amount equal to the year-end bonus paid to Executive for the fiscal year immediately preceding the Change in Control in accordance with the Company's regular payroll practices, until such time as Executive is determined to be eligible for long term disability benefits in accordance with any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy then in effect.
 
(b)           If Executive's employment shall be terminated by the Company for Cause or by Executive other than for Good Reason or Disability, the Company shall pay to Executive his full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have no further obligation to Executive under this Agreement, except with respect to any accrued benefits to which Executive is entitled under any Company pension or welfare benefit plan, insurance program or as may otherwise be required by law.
 
(c)           If Executive's employment shall be terminated by the Company or by Executive for Disability, or by reason of death, the Company shall pay to Executive (or Executive's designated beneficiaries or estate, if no beneficiary is designated) any and all benefits to which Executive is entitled under any Company-sponsored insurance program then in effect within thirty (30) days of such Disability or death.  Any payment made to Executive in excess of those provided by any Company-sponsored disability insurance policy shall be paid in accordance with the requirements of and subject to the applicable definitions of Code Section 409A.
 
(d)           If Executive's employment by the Company shall be terminated (A) by the Company other than for Cause or Disability or (B) by Executive for Good Reason, then Executive shall be entitled to each of the benefits provided by (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) below, subject to the provisions of (v) and (vi) below.  All payments pursuant to this Section 4(d) shall be paid six (6) months after the Date of Termination or over the course of a specified period of time with respect to and as provided in subsection (iii); that an amount of such payments permitted by Section 409A of the Code, inclusive of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, shall be paid to Executive in equal portions over the course of the first six (6) months after the Date of Termination in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.
provided
 
(i)            the Company shall pay Executive Executive's full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time the Notice of Termination is given and any other form or type of compensation otherwise payable for such period;
 
(ii)           in lieu of any further salary payments for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as a severance payment (the "Severance Payment") an amount equal to 2.99 times the average of the annual compensation which was paid to Executive by the Company (or any corporation ("Affiliate") affiliated with the Company within the meaning of section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code")) and included in Executive's gross income for Federal income tax purposes for the five calendar years (or, if Executive has been employed by the Company for less than five, the number of complete calendar years of employment) (the "Base Period") preceding the earlier of the calendar year in which a Change in Control of the Company occurred or the calendar year of the Date of Termination. Such average shall be determined in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 280G(d) of the Code. Compensation paid to Executive by the Company (or an Affiliate) shall include every type and form of compensation included in Executive's gross income in respect of Executive's employment by the Company (or an Affiliate), including compensation income recognized as a result of the exercise of stock options or sale of the stock so acquired, except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under section 280G(d) of the Code.
 
(iii)          For a 36 month period after the Date of Termination, the Company shall arrange to provide Executive with life, disability, accident and health insurance benefits substantially similar to those which Executive is receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Notice of Termination.  Executive shall be responsible for the payment of his or her portion of the premiums for such benefits (recognizing that Executive shall remain responsible for payment of the same relative percentage of total premiums as Executive paid prior to the Date of Termination). Benefits otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this paragraph (iii) shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by Executive during such 36
 
 
month period, and any such benefits actually received by Executive shall be reported to the Company.
 
(iv)          Except to the extent such payment would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code as determined under subsection (d)(v) hereof, the Company shall also pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in the event Executive has a bona fide claim for wrongful termination (including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement).
 
(v)           The Severance Payment shall be reduced by the value of benefits actually provided in (iii) above and by the amount of any other payment or the value of any benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with the termination of employment or contingent upon a Change in Control of the Company (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the Company or an Affiliate) unless (1) Executive shall have effectively waived receipt or enjoyment of such payment or benefit prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payment, (2) in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to Executive, such other payment or benefit does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, or (3) in the opinion of such tax counsel, the Severance Payment (in its full amount or as partially reduced, as the case may be) plus all other payments or benefits which constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code are reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of the Code, and such payments are deductible by the Company. The value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred cash payment shall be determined by the Company in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
 
(vi)          If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding that, notwithstanding the good faith of Executive and the Company in applying the terms of this Subsection 4(d), the aggregate "parachute payments" paid to or for Executive's benefit are in an amount that would result in any portion of such "parachute payments" not being deductible by the Company or its Affiliates by reason of section 280G of the Code, then Executive shall have an obligation to pay the Company upon demand an amount equal to the sum of (1) the excess of the aggregate "parachute payments" paid to or for Executive's benefit over the aggregate "parachute payments" that would have been paid to or for Executive's benefit without any portion of such "parachute payments" not being deductible by reason of section 280G of the Code; and (2) interest on the amount set forth in clause (1) of this sentence at the applicable Federal rate (as defined in section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of Executive's receipt of such excess until the date of such payment.
 
(e)           Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits after the Date of Termination, or otherwise except as specifically provided in this Section 4.
 
5.             . In order to assure the performance by the Company or its successor of its obligations under this Agreement, the Company may at any time deposit in trust an amount equal to the maximum payment that will be due Executive under the terms hereof; , , that the Company shall deposit in trust the amount equal to the maximum payment due Executive immediately upon an Unfriendly Change in Control.  Under a written trust instrument, the Trustee shall be instructed to pay to Executive (or Executive's legal representative, as the case may be) the amount to which Executive shall be entitled under the terms hereof, and the balance, if any, of the trust not so paid or reserved for payment shall be repaid to the Company. If the Company deposits funds in trust, payment shall be made by the Trustee to Executive in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  If and to the extent there are not amounts in trust sufficient to pay Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall remain liable for any and all payments due to Executive. In accordance with the terms of such trust, at all times during the term of this Agreement, Executive shall have no rights, other than as an unsecured general creditor of the Company, to any amounts held in trust and all trust assets shall be general assets of the Company and
Funding of Payments
provided
however
 
 
subject to the claims of creditors of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Unfriendly Change of Control" shall be a Change in Control which has not been approved by a majority of the Incumbent Directors in office immediately prior to the Change in Control.
 
6.             .
Successors; Binding Agreement
 
(a)           The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement.
 
(b)           This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, successors, heirs and designated beneficiaries. If Executive should die while any amount would still be payable to Executive hereunder if Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Executive's designated beneficiaries, or, if there is no such designated beneficiary, to Executive's estate.
 
7.             . For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by united States first class mail, postage pre-paid, addressed to the last known residence address of Executive or in the case of the Company, to its principal office to the attention of its then Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to its Secretary, or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
Notice
 
8.             . If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is required to comply with Code Section 409A, the Company shall have the authority, without the consent of the Executive to interpret and/or amend such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code 409A.
Compliance with Code 409A
 
9.             . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the parties. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party to this Agreement of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or similar time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. The invalidity or unenforceability or any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

The Letter of Credit Fee will accrue on the face amount of such standby Letter of Credit outstanding from time to time at the LIBO Rate Margin, payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the Facility Termination Date or earlier termination of the Commitments; provided, however, that from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default and continuing thereafter until such Event of Default shall be remedied to the written satisfaction of the Required Lenders, upon written notice from the Administrative Agent, the annual rate at which the Letter of Credit Fee accrues with respect to each standby Letter of Credit shall be equal to the sum of (A) the annual rate that would accrue but for this proviso, and (B) 2%.
 
(iii)
         
In addition, the Borrowers shall pay to the Issuing Lender, on demand, any and all of the Issuing Lender's customary fees in connection with the fronting, negotiation and administration of, and any drawings or acceptances under, any Letter of Credit.
 
The Borrower shall pay the amount of each draft drawn under any Letter of Credit to the Issuing Lender on demand, together with interest at the Floating Rate from the date that such draft is paid by the Issuing Lender until payment of such amount in full.  The Issuing Lender may (at its option) charge any deposit account maintained with the Issuing Lender for the amount of any draft drawn under a Letter of Credit.
(c)
          
Reimbursement by Borrower.
 
Each Lender shall be deemed to hold a participation interest in each Letter of Credit equal to that Lender's Percentage of the face amount of that Letter of Credit.  If the Issuing Lender makes any payment pursuant to the terms of any Letter of Credit and is not promptly reimbursed, the Issuing Lender may request that each other Lender pay such Lender's Percentage of the unreimbursed amount.  Upon receipt of any such request prior to 11:00 a.m. on a Business Day, the recipient shall be unconditionally and irrevocably obligated to pay its Percentage of the unreimbursed amount to the Issuing Lender in immediately available funds prior to 3:00 p.m. on such date.  Notices received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day.  If payment is not made by a Lender when due hereunder, interest on the unpaid amount shall accrue from the date of the Issuing Lender's request through the date of payment at the Federal Funds Rate.  After making any payment to the Issuing Lender under this subsection in connection with a particular Letter of Credit, a Lender shall be entitled to participate to the extent of its Percentage in the related reimbursements received by the Issuing Lender from the Borrower or otherwise. Upon receiving any such reimbursement, the Issuing Lender will distribute to each Lender its Percentage of such reimbursement.  At the option of the Issuing Lender, any payment by a Lender hereunder may be deemed an Advance in accordance with Section 2.1 and payable under the Revolving Notes.
(d)
          
Reimbursement by Lenders.
 
Unless otherwise approved by the Lenders, no Letter of Credit shall have an initial or any renewal term of more than one year. Unless otherwise agreed by the Required Lenders in writing, the Borrower shall deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, not less than 5 Business Days before the Facility Termination Date, an amount equal to the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding, less the balance (if any) then outstanding in the L/C Cash Collateral Account.

(a)
          
Floating Rate Fundings.
 
So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower may request that a portion of any requested Borrowing constitute a LIBO Rate Funding, or may convert all or any part of any outstanding Floating Rate Funding into a LIBO Rate Funding, or may request that a LIBO Rate Funding be converted at the end of the applicable Interest Period to another LIBO Rate Funding, by giving notice to the Administrative Agent of such request or conversion not later than 10:30 a.m. on a Business Day which is at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested Borrowing or conversion. Each such notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy transmission, shall specify the date and amount of such Borrowing or conversion, and the Interest Period therefor. The Interest Period applicable to each LIBO Rate Funding shall begin on a Business Day, and the amount of each LIBO Rate Funding shall be equal to $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 greater than $1,000,000. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the principal amount specified by the Borrower in the applicable request for a LIBO Rate Funding shall bear interest from and including the first day of
(b)
          
LIBO Rate Fundings.
 
the Interest Period specified therein to but not including the last day of such Interest Period, at the LIBO Rate applicable thereto, determined as set forth herein. Unless the Borrower requests a new LIBO Rate Funding in accordance with the procedures set forth above, or prepays the principal of an outstanding LIBO Rate Funding at the expiration of an Interest Period, the Lenders shall automatically and without request of the Borrower convert each LIBO Rate Funding to a Floating Rate Funding on the last day of the relevant Interest Period.
 
The applicable LIBO Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent between the opening of business and noon on the second Business Day prior to the beginning of such Interest Period, whereupon notice thereof (which may be by telephone) shall be given by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower and each of the Lenders. Each such determination of the applicable LIBO Rate shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable error. The Administrative Agent, upon written request of the Borrower, shall deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the applicable LIBO Rate hereunder.
(c)
          
Setting of LIBO Rates.
 
In no event shall more than four LIBO Rate Fundings be outstanding at any one time. In no event may the Borrower request a LIBO Rate Funding if, after giving effect to such LIBO Rate Funding, the Borrower would be required to prepay a LIBO Rate Funding in order to make any regularly scheduled principal payment.
(d)
          
Limitations on LIBO Rate Fundings.
 
. From and after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default and continuing thereafter until such Default or Event of Default shall be remedied to the written satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, the outstanding principal balance of the Notes shall bear interest, until paid in full, at an annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the interest rate otherwise in effect with respect thereto, and (ii) 200 basis points (2.00% per annum) (the "Default Rate"). Calculation of interest at the Default Rate shall not be deemed a waiver or excuse of any such Default or Event of Default.

Any partial reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount shall reduce each Lender's Revolving Commitment pro rata in accordance with that Lender's Percentage.
 
. On each date set forth below, if the Revolving Commitments have not been terminated and the Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount exceeds the amount set forth below opposite such date, the Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount shall automatically reduce to the amount set forth opposite such date:
(b)
          
Automatic Reductions
 
 
Each reduction in the Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount shall be distributed pro rata to each Lender's Revolving Commitment in accordance with that Lender's Percentage. If, after giving effect to any such reduction, the Revolving Facility Outstandings exceed the then-applicable Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall immediately remit to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such excess, without notice or demand by any Lender Party. Such amount shall be applied to the prepayment of the Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion elect; and if any such amount remains after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Obligations the undrawn amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit, such remainder shall be deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account and shall secure the Obligations and otherwise be governed in accordance with Section 7.3.

. All payments of principal of and interest due under the Notes shall be made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon on the date due at such place as the Administrative Agent may from time to time designate in writing, and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next following Business Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge the Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Administrative Agent for the amount of any such payment on its due date, or (at the option of the Administrative Agent) to effect a Borrowing in such amount, all without receipt of any request for such charge or Borrowing, but the Lender's failure to so charge such account or effect such Borrowing shall in no way affect the obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment.

Making of Payments
 
. Unless the Administrative Agent has been notified by a Lender or the Borrower prior to the date on which such Lender or the Borrower is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds of an Advance to be made by it hereunder or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of one or more of the Lenders hereunder (such payment by a Lender or the Borrower (as the case may be) being herein

Assumed Payments
 
called a ), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that it does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may (but shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on such date and, if such Lender or the Borrower (as the case may be) has not in fact made the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon for each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate (i) equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day, in the case of a Required Payment owing by a Lender, or (ii) equal to the applicable rate of interest as provided in this Agreement, in the case of a Required Payment owing by the Borrower.
"Required Payment"
 
. The Borrower agrees that each Lender shall have all rights of setoff and bankers' lien provided by applicable law, and in addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that if at any time any amount is due and owing by the Borrower under this Agreement to any Lender at a time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, any Lender may apply any and all balances, credits, and deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter in the possession of that Lender (excluding, however, any trust or escrow accounts held by the Borrower for the benefit of any third party) to the payment thereof.
(c)
          
Setoff
 
. If any payment of principal of or interest on any Floating Rate Funding or any fees payable hereunder falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day, and (in the case of principal) additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the period of such extension.
(d)
          
Due Date Extension
 
. Except as otherwise provided herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, each payment received from the Borrower shall be applied to such obligation as the Borrower shall specify by notice received by the Administrative Agent on or before the date of such payment, or in the absence of such notice, as the Required Lenders shall determine in their discretion. Except as otherwise provided herein, after the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the Lenders shall have the right to apply all payments received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower as the Required Lenders may determine in their discretion. The Borrower agrees that the amount shown on the books and records of the Lender Parties as being the principal balance of and interest on the Notes shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

Increased Costs on LIBO Rate Fundings
 
thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall:
 
subject that Lender to or cause the withdrawal or termination of any exemption previously granted to that Lender with respect to, any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its LIBO Rate Fundings or its obligation to make LIBO Rate Fundings, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to that Lender of the principal of or interest under this Agreement in respect of its LIBO Rate Fundings or its obligation to make LIBO Rate Fundings (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of that Lender imposed by the jurisdictions in which that Lender's principal executive office is located); or
(i)
           
 
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any reserve included in the determination of interest rates pursuant to Section 2.4), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, that Lender; or
(ii)
          
 
impose on that Lender any other condition affecting its making, maintaining or funding of its LIBO Rate Fundings or its obligation to make LIBO Rate Fundings;
(iii)
         
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to that Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Funding, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by that Lender under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect to a LIBO Rate Funding, then that Lender will notify the Borrower of such increased cost and within fifteen (15) days after demand by that Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis of such demand and representing that that Lender has made similar demand on one or more other commercial borrowers with revolving or term loans in excess of $500,000) the Borrower shall pay to that Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate that Lender for such increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that no such increased cost or such reduction shall be payable by the Borrower for any period longer than ninety (90) days prior to the date on which notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower, unless such increased cost or such reduction shall apply retroactively, in which case, the Borrower shall pay such additional amount or amounts as will compensate that Lender for such increased cost or such reduction for the longer of ninety (90) days prior to the date on which notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower or the retroactive period applicable to such increased cost or such reduction. Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle that Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.10. If the Borrower receives notice from any Lender of any event which will entitle that Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.10, the Borrower may prepay any then outstanding LIBO Rate Fundings or notify that Lender that any pending request for a LIBO Rate Funding shall be deemed to be a request for a Floating Rate Funding, in each case subject to the provisions of Section 2.11.
 
. If any Lender determines at any time that its Return has been reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy Rule Change, that Lender may require the Borrower to pay it the amount necessary to restore that Lender's Return to what it would have been had there been no Capital Adequacy Rule Change. For purposes of this 2.10, the following definitions shall apply:
(b)
          
Capital Adequacy
 
, for any calendar quarter or shorter period, means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the sum of interest and ongoing fees earned by a Lender under this Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital that Lender is required to maintain during such period as a result of its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by that Lender based upon its total capital requirements and a reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect. Return may be calculated for each calendar quarter and for the shorter period between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of termination in whole of this Agreement.
(i)
           
"Return"
 
means any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that applies to any Lender, or the interpretation thereof by any governmental or regulatory authority. Capital Adequacy Rules include rules requiring financial institutions to maintain total capital in amounts based upon percentages of outstanding loans, binding loan commitments and letters of credit.
(ii)
          
"Capital Adequacy Rule"
 
means any change in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this Agreement, but does not include any changes in applicable requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any increases in the capital that any Lender is required to maintain to the extent that the increases are required due to a regulatory authority's assessment of that Lender's financial condition.
(iii)
         
"Capital Adequacy Rule Change"
 
includes (but is not limited to) the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, and any assignee of any interest of any Lender hereunder and any participant in the loans made hereunder.
(iv)
         
"Lender"
 
The initial notice sent by a Lender shall be sent as promptly as practicable after that Lender learns that its Return has been reduced, shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore that Lender's Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, shall state in reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in that Lender's Return and that Lender's calculation of the amount of such reduction, and shall include that Lender's representation that it has made similar demand on one or more other commercial borrowers with revolving or term loans in excess of $500,000. Thereafter, that Lender may send a new notice during each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore that Lender's Return for that quarter. A Lender's calculation in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.
 
. If with respect to any Interest Period:
(c)
          
Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
 
any Lender determines that deposits in U.S. dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the London interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period; or
(i)
           
 
any Lender otherwise determines that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBO Rate; or
(ii)
          
 
any Lender determines that the LIBO Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to that Lender of maintaining or funding a LIBO Rate Funding for such Interest Period, or that the making or funding of LIBO Rate Fundings has become impracticable as a result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of that Lender materially affects such LIBO Rate Fundings;
(iii)
         
 
then that Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and (A) upon the occurrence of any event described in the foregoing clause (i) the Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations with that Lender in order to determine an alternate method to determine the LIBO Rate for that Lender, and during the pendency of such negotiations with that Lender, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make any new LIBO Rate Fundings, and (B) upon the occurrence of any event described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), for so long as such circumstances shall continue, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make any new LIBO Rate Fundings.
 
(d)
          
Illegality
. If any change in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any governmental authority, central bank, comparable agency or any other regulatory body charged with the interpretation, implementation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, comparable agency or other regulatory body, should make it or, in the good faith judgment of that Lender, shall raise a substantial question as to whether it is unlawful for that Lender to make, maintain or fund LIBO Rate Fundings, then (i) that Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, maintain or convert into LIBO Rate Fundings shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness (and to the extent it shall be unlawful for one or more of the Lenders to maintain any such LIBO Rate Fundings, such LIBO Rate Fundings shall be immediately converted to Floating Rate Fundings), and (iii)  for the duration of such unlawfulness, any notice by the Borrower requesting the Lenders to make or convert into LIBO Rate Fundings shall be construed as a request to make or to continue making Floating Rate Fundings.
 
Funding Losses.
Section 2.11
        
 
Upon demand by any Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed), the Borrower shall indemnify that Lender against any loss or expense which that Lender may have sustained or incurred (including, without limitation, any net loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by that Lender to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Fundings) or which that Lender may be deemed to have sustained or incurred, as reasonably determined by that Lender, (i) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with any LIBO Rate Fundings, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or convert any LIBO Rate Fundings on a date specified therefor in a notice thereof or (iii) due to any payment or prepayment of any LIBO Rate Funding on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such LIBO Rate Funding. For this purpose, all notices under Section 2.4(b) shall be deemed to be irrevocable.
 
Discretion of Lenders as to Manner of Funding.
Section 2.12
        
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain all or any part of its LIBO Rate Fundings in any manner it deems fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, Section 2.11 hereof) all determinations hereunder shall be made as if that Lender had actually funded and maintained each LIBO Rate Funding during each Interest Period for such LIBO Rate Funding through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the appropriate LIBO Rate for such Interest Period.
 
Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of Provisions.
Section 2.13
        
 
Determinations and statements of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.10 and 2.11 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower shall have no right to review any records of any Lender or its other customers to determine the accuracy of any statement by that Lender under Section 2.10(a) or 2.10(b) regarding that Lender's demands upon other customers of that Lender.  Each Lender may use reasonable averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation pursuant to such Sections 2.10 and 2.11 and the provisions of Sections 2.10 and 2.11 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
 
Computation of Interest and Fees.
Section 2.14
        
 
Interest under the Notes and the fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

ARTICLE VIII The Administrative Agent
 
Authorization.
Section 8.1
           
 
Each Lender and the holder of each Note irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act on behalf of such Lender or holder to the extent provided herein or in any document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and to take such other action as may be reasonably incidental thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, each Lender irrevocably (i) authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that the Administrative Agent may have hereunder or thereunder, (ii) appoints the Administrative Agent as nominal beneficiary or nominal secured party, as the case may be, under the Loan Documents and all related UCC-1 financing statements, and (iii) authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as agent of and for such Lender for purposes of holding, perfecting and disposing of the collateral under the Loan Documents.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders or, if so required pursuant to Section 9.2, upon the instructions of all Lenders; provided, however, that except for action expressly required of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, and the Administrative Agent shall not in any event be required to take any action which is contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law.
 
Distribution of Payments and Proceeds.
Section 8.2
                                  
 
After deduction of any costs of collection, as provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any fee payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such under this Agreement, any Fee Letter or any other agreement, the Administrative Agent shall remit to each Lender that Lender's pro rata share of all payments of principal and interest and of all fees and other amounts payable hereunder for the benefit of the Lenders that are received by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.  Each Lender's interest in the Loan Documents shall be payable solely from payments, collections and proceeds actually received by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents; and the Administrative Agent's only liability to the Lenders hereunder shall be to account for each Lender's pro rata share of such payments, collections and proceeds in accordance with this Agreement.  If the Administrative Agent is ever required for any reason to refund any such payments, collections or proceeds, each Lender will refund to the Administrative Agent, upon demand, its pro rata share of such payments, collections or proceeds, together with its pro rata share of interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with such refund.
(a)
          
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender has wrongfully refused to fund its applicable Percentage of any Borrowing or other Advance as required hereunder, or if the principal balance of any Lender's Note is for any other reason less than its applicable Percentage of the aggregate principal balances of the Notes then outstanding, the Administrative Agent may remit all payments received by it to the other Lenders until such payments have reduced the aggregate amounts owed by the Borrower to the extent that the aggregate amount owing to such Lender hereunder is equal to its applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount owing to all of the Lenders hereunder.  The provisions of this paragraph are intended only to set forth certain rules for the application of payments, proceeds and collections in the event that a Lender has breached its obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Lender from such obligations.
(b)
          
 
Expenses.
Section 8.3
                                  
 
All payments, collections and proceeds received or effected by the Administrative Agent may be applied, first, to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all costs, expenses, damages and liabilities at any time incurred by or imposed upon the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including but not limited to all reasonable attorney's fees (whether paid to outside counsel or allocated to the Administrative Agent by in-house counsel), foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of any collateral).  If the Administrative Agent does not receive payments, collections or proceeds sufficient to cover any such costs, expenses, damages or liabilities within 30 days after their incurrence or imposition, each Lender shall, upon demand, remit to the Administrative Agent its Percentage of the difference between (i) such costs, expenses, damages and liabilities, and (ii) such payments, collections and proceeds, together with interest on such amount for each day following the thirtieth day after demand therefor until so remitted at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each such day.
 
Payments Received Directly by Lenders.
Section 8.4
           
 
If any Lender or other holder of a Note shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise) on account of the Obligations other than through distributions made in accordance with Section 8.2, such Lender or holder shall promptly give notice of such fact to the Administrative Agent and shall purchase from the other Lenders or holders such participations in the Obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause the purchasing Lender or holder to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender or holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchasing Lender restored to the extent of such recovery (but without interest thereon).
 
Indemnification.
Section 8.5
           
 
Each Lender severally (but not jointly) hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, as well as the Administrative Agent's agents, employees, officers and directors, ratably according to their respective Percentages from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgment, demands, damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) of any kind or nature whatsoever, which are imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent or its agents, employees, officers or directors in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent; , , that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of any such losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs disbursements, or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall (a) be responsible for any recitals, representations or warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (b) be responsible for the validity, genuineness, perfection, effectiveness, enforceability, existence, value or enforcement of any collateral security, (c) be under any duty to inquire into or pass upon any of the foregoing matters, or to make any inquiry concerning the performance by the Borrower or any other obligor of its obligations, or (d) in any event, be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by it or them, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and
 
powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
 
Administrative Agent and Affiliates.
Section 8.7
           
 
The Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder in its individual capacity as any other Lender, and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as fully as if the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
Credit Investigation.
Section 8.8
           
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have been the case had its obligations hereunder been incurred and the Advances made directly by such Lender to the Borrower without the intervention of the Administrative Agent or any other Lender.  Each Lender agrees and acknowledges that the Administrative Agent makes no representations or warranties about the creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other party to this Agreement or with respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith.
 
Resignation and Assignment of Administrative Agent.
Section 8.9
           
 
The Administrative Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders.

If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the resigning Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof.
(a)
          
 
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon be entitled to receive from the prior Administrative Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such successor Administrative Agent may reasonably request and the resigning or assigning Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any resignation or assignment pursuant to this Section, the provisions of this Section shall inure to the benefit of the retiring Administrative Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent hereunder.
(b)
          
 
Defaults.
Section 8.10
        
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (other than under paragraph (a) of Section 7.1) hereof unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower specifying the
 
occurrence of such Default or Event of Default.  In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 8.5 hereof) take such actions with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may take any action, or refrain from taking any action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.
 
Obligations Several.
Section 8.11
                           
 
The obligations of each Lender hereunder are the several obligations of such Lender, and neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the obligations of any other Lender hereunder, nor will the failure by the Lender Parties to perform any of their obligations hereunder relieve the Administrative Agent or any other Lender from the performance of its respective obligations hereunder.  Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken by any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or pursuant to or in connection with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders, together or with or without the Administrative Agent, as a partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity.
 
Assignments.
Section 8.12

Any assignment hereunder may be made only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower; provided, however, that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment.

affiliates of such Lender, provided that, unless consented to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), no such sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of Revolving Commitments shall relieve the transferring Lender from its obligations (to the extent such affiliate does not fulfill its obligations) hereunder; and

each Lender may at any time sell, assign, transfer, or negotiate all or any part of its Revolving Commitment, Advances, Notes, and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents to one or more Lenders, and any such sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation shall relieve the transferring Lender from its obligations hereunder to the extent of the obligations so transferred (except, in any event, to the extent that the Borrower, any other Lender or the Administrative Agent has rights against such transferring Lender as a result of any default by such transferring Lender under this Agreement);
 
provided, however, that any partial sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation pursuant to this Section shall be pro rata as to all of the Revolving Commitment, Notes and Advances transferred.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS,  October 23, 2008  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported
net sales of $204.3 million for the fiscal 2009 second quarter ended September 30, 2008, compared with $205.2 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter were $16.9 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, versus $13.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
For the six months ended September 30, 2008, Arctic Cat's net sales were $298.2 million compared with $293.1 million in the first six months of last fiscal year. Net earnings were $10.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $6.8 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the prior-year first half.
 
"Our second-quarter and six-month results primarily benefited from continued growth in our parts, garments and accessories business, and a lower effective tax rate," said Christopher A. Twomey, chairman and chief executive officer. "Year-to-date, we've also seen positive results from the snowmobile dealer inventory-reduction initiatives we took last year. We remain cautious, however, about our prospects in the last six months of our fiscal year, due to the challenging economic climate."
 
During the quarter, Arctic Cat announced that Claude J. Jordan joined the company as president and chief operating officer. Jordan brings more than 20 years of experience in senior management positions, most recently with The Home Depot and General Electric.
 
Review of Results
 
Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales in the fiscal 2009 second quarter increased 1 percent to $98.4 million, up from $97.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date snowmobile sales grew 10 percent to $119.8 million versus $108.9 million in the first six months of last fiscal year.
 
During the second quarter, Arctic Cat unveiled three new 2009 model snowmobiles: the Sno Pro 600, M8 HCR and the Z1 Turbo Sno Pro. The Z1 Turbo  which tested faster than a Corvette in the quarter-mile  is the world's fastest production snowmobile. The company introduced these new models at the Hay Days Grass Drags in Minnesota. Hay Days, an annual
grass drag racing event, is the unofficial kick-off of the snowmobile season and said to be the world's largest snowmobile event, attracting more than 30,000 snowmobile enthusiasts. Arctic Cat was encouraged to see strong interest in its products by attendees of this year's show.
In the 2009 second quarter, the company reported that ATV sales declined 8 percent to $71.6 million versus $77.5 million in the same quarter last year. For the first six months, ATV sales were down 9 percent to $125.4 million compared with $137.3 million in the prior-year six months.
 
The growth areas in the ATV market continue to be units with large-displacement engines in both the ATV and side-by-side utility segments. Arctic Cat's new 2009 model line-up extends its side-by-side Prowler UTV line. The company's new high-performance Prowler XTZ 1000 combines a side-by-side utility vehicle with an Arctic Cat-engineered 1000cc engine, offering the most powerful UTV available in the industry. Arctic Cat's new 2009 ATV model Thundercat
1000 also offers a very competitively positioned product that features the industry's largest-displacement engine. Additionally, as the first manufacturer to offer a 2-rider ATV vehicle, Arctic Cat builds on its innovative reputation with the new luxury cruiser Thundercat TRV
1000, which not only has enough power to go anywhere, it can do so in comfort and style, with heated handlebars, passenger handgrips, touring windshield and lockable travel case, among its many available features.
 
Arctic Cat's PG&A sales grew 12 percent to $34.3 million in the 2009 second quarter versus $30.6 million in the year-ago period. Contributing to the PG&A sales growth in the quarter were strong pre-season sales of snow-related products. For the six months, PG&A sales rose 13 percent to $53.0 million compared with $46.9 million in the same period last year.
 
Outlook
 
                For its fiscal 2009 third quarter ending December 31, 2008, Arctic Cat expects net sales to range between $179 million and $189 million compared with $159.6 million for the same period last fiscal year. The net loss for the quarter is estimated to be between $0.25 and $0.35 per diluted share versus a net loss of $0.58 per diluted share in the prior-year third quarter.
 
               
Commented Twomey: "We
believe that innovative products will drive retail sales and market share gains. Dealer inventory levels are critical to the overall health of our business and w
e are confident that last year's inventory reduction measures, and our strong product line-up, position us well compared to our competitors.
We also remain focused on further cost reductions through our strategic sourcing initiatives and leveraging our efficiencies.
Despite these positive factors, t
he current state of the U.S. economy, impacted by weak consumer spending and the global financial crisis, makes it difficult to fully assess the impact on our customers and business. As a result, we are not providing full-year guidance at this time.
We will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, industry trends and dealer inventories."

Fiscal 2009 Third-Quarter Highlights:
 
                 
Third-quarter loss per share improves to $0.15 on increased snowmobile sales;
                 
Company announces profitability initiatives to strengthen financial results;
                 
Provides fourth-quarter outlook
 
MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 29, 2009  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported net sales of $174.7 million for the fiscal 2009 third quarter ended December 31, 2008, compared to $159.6 million in the same quarter last year. The net loss for the quarter improved to $2.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, versus the prior-year third quarter net loss of $10.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, Arctic Cat's net sales totaled $472.9 million compared to $452.7 million in the same period last year. The company reported net earnings of $7.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the nine-month period last year.
 
"Increased snowmobile sales to dealers, which generated higher gross margins, and lower operating expenses contributed to a narrower loss for the quarter. As a result, the company is profitable through the first nine months of our fiscal year," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer.
 
Commenting further, Twomey said: "Unfortunately, overall demand for recreational products remains weak, due to the year-long deterioration in global economic conditions, higher unemployment, historically low consumer confidence and the continued credit crisis. As a result, i
ndustrywide ATV retail sales declined further in the December quarter and we do not see a quick recovery. Retail sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs fared somewhat better than the industry as a whole for the quarter and year to date. However, because of the weak retail environment, w
e are now planning significantly lower ATV sales to our dealers in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year period, in order to better align dealer inventories with consumer demand. This action will negatively impact
our revenue and profitability this fiscal year, but it is necessary given prevailing market conditions
. Given this situation, we are implementing several profitability
 
 
initiatives aimed at improving our margins, reducing operating expenses and achieving profitability in our next fiscal year 2010.
"
 
Product Line Results
 
Sales of Arctic Cat's snowmobiles rose 51 percent to $90.9 million in the 2009 third quarter versus $60.0 million in the fiscal third quarter last year. Innovative new products, lower North American dealer inventories and increased international sales led to significantly higher snowmobile sales in the quarter. Arctic Cat's year-to-date snowmobile sales totaled $210.7 million, up 25 percent from $168.9 million in the prior-year period.
 
"
We are pleased with the response to our 2009 model introductions.
Our newest snowmobiles demonstrate our ongoing strategy to grow market share by offering industry
-leading technologies with products such as our Z1 Turbo Sno Pro, which is the world's fastest production snowmobile and exceeds 2012 EPA emissions standards," said Twomey.
 
Sales of Arctic Cat's ATVs were
down 18 percent to $57.8 million versus $70.1 million in
the prior-year third quarter. Arctic Cat's 2009 third quarter results benefitted from sales of the Prowler utility vehicle and large-displacement engine models, such as the launch of the new two-rider TRV 1000 and Prowler 1000 XTZ, as well as the Thundercat 1000 ATV. However, this was not enough to offset the
continued weak environment for ATVs in general
. Year-to-date, Arctic Cat's ATV sales totaled $183.2 million, down 12 percent compared to $207.4 million in the first nine months of last fiscal year.
 
Parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) sales in the fiscal 2009 third quarter were $26.1 million, down 11 percent compared to $29.5 million in the prior-year third quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments of snow-related preseason products, which the company reported in its fiscal second quarter.
Year-to-date PG&A sales totaled $79.1 million, up 4 percent versus $76.4 million in the year-ago period.
 
Company Announces Profitability Initiatives
 
Based on lower sales volumes, Arctic Cat is
implementing several initiatives aimed at returning the company to profitability in its next fiscal year, ending March 31, 2010. Specifically, the company is focused on: rescaling its business to meet anticipated demand; improving gross margins, reducing operating expenses; and conserving cash.
 
As a result, Arctic Cat is streamlining its production operations from three production lines to two. The company also recently eliminated approximately 100 positions, or 7 percent of
 
 
its 1,400 employees.
Arctic Cat does not expect to take a material charge for the operational streamlining and workforce reduction.
 
Arctic Cat also will implement various other initiatives aimed at improving gross margins by 300 to 400 basis points and lowering operating expenses by 10 percent to 15 percent. The company continues to focus on achieving greater efficiency through lean manufacturing and global low-cost sourcing.
 
Additionally, t
o preserve cash for operations, Arctic Cat's board of directors has voted to suspend regular quarterly cash dividends effective immediately on its common stock. Suspending the dividend will conserve more than $5 million in cash annually.
 
"The board's decision to suspend the dividend is prudent, given the current slowdown in our industry, the company's anticipated near-term earnings and the general macroeconomic conditions," said Twomey. "While we cannot predict when the economy will improve, we expect that as conditions normalize, our future earnings levels would permit resumption of dividend payments."
 
Outlook
 
For the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter ending March 31, 2009, Arctic Cat expects net sales in the range of $90 million to $100 million. The net loss for the 2009 fourth quarter is estimated to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per diluted share. Arctic Cat plans to ship half as many ATVs in the 2009 fourth quarter as in the prior-year period, to better align dealer inventories with consumer demand. The company reported net sales of $168.9 million and net earnings of $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year.
 
For the full year ending March 31, 2009, Arctic Cat anticipates net sales in the range of $562 million to $572 million and a net loss of between $0.46 and $0.56 per diluted share. The company reported fiscal 2008 net sales of $621.6 million and a net loss of $0.18 per diluted share.

Dated: May 28, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., May 28, 2009  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported a net loss of $16.7 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, on net sales of $90.7 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009, which was within the company's previously stated guidance range. Arctic Cat's 2009 fourth quarter results include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.75 million, or a $0.10 loss per diluted share,
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142
.
The non-cash goodwill write-down has no impact on Arctic Cat's cash flow or liquidity.
 
Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the fourth quarter net loss would have been $15.0 million, or $0.83 per diluted share. For the prior-year fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008, Arctic Cat reported net earnings of $424,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, on net sales of $168.9 million.
 
For the fiscal 2009 full year, Arctic Cat posted net sales of $563.6 million compared to $621.6 million last fiscal year. The company reported a fiscal 2009 net loss of $9.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, including the $0.10 per share goodwill impairment charge, versus a net loss of $3.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008.
 
"Arctic Cat was profitable through the first nine months of fiscal 2009, due to increased snowmobile sales to dealers and distributors and lower operating expenses, but overall retail demand for recreational products remained weak in the fourth quarter as expected," said Christopher A. Twomey, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer. "In light of the difficult retail environment, we continued our plan to further reduce dealer inventories during the quarter, resulting in lower inventory levels across all product lines. However, this necessary action negatively impacted the company's revenue and profitability for the fourth quarter and full year
."
 
Business Line Results
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales totaled $64.1 million in the 2009 fourth quarter versus $142.9 million in the
same period last year. For fiscal 2009, Arctic Cat's ATV sales were $247.3 million compared with $350.3 million last fiscal year. ATV revenues were down for the quarter and full year due to lower ATV retail sales during the current economic downturn, and the company's decision to lower production to reduce dealer inventory.
 
Snowmobile sales improved to a negative $3.4 million in the 2009 fourth quarter due to lower promotional sales incentives on dealer inventory compared with a
negative $7.1 million in the prior-year quarter. For the 2009 fiscal year, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales rose to $207.3 million versus $161.9 million in the previous year. Contributing to the full-year snowmobile sales growth were innovative new products, lower North American dealer inventories and increased international sales.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories
(PG&A) in the 2009 fourth quarter were $30.0 million versus $33.0 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full fiscal year, PG&A sales were essentially flat at $109.0 million versus $109.4 million in fiscal 2008.
 
Impairment Charge
 
As noted above, Arctic Cat reported a non-cash impairment charge of $1.75 million, or a $0.10 loss per diluted share, due to the write-down of goodwill. The company recently completed its annual goodwill evaluation in accordance with SFAS No. 142. This evaluation resulted in an impairment charge due to the company's fiscal year fourth quarter and annual operating results, and continued decline in Arctic Cat's stock price resulting in a market capitalization below book value.  The charge is non-cash and does not affect the company's cash flow or liquidity.
 
Outlook
 
As previously announced on January 29, 2009, Arctic Cat is continuing to implement initiatives aimed at returning the company to profitability on lower anticipated sales volumes. At this time, Arctic Cat estimates sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, in the range of $425 million to $460 million, based on achieving ATV sales of $188 million to $203 million, snowmobile sales in the range of $140 million to $152 million and PG&A sales of $97 million to $105 million. Given the degree of economic uncertainty affecting the recreational products market, Arctic Cat does not believe it can accurately project fiscal 2010 earnings per share at this time, although the company expects improved per share results compared with fiscal 2009.
 
 
 
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2010 outlook includes the following assumptions: the continuation of the weak global economic environment negatively impacting sales of recreational products; increasing gross margins up to 300 basis points through global low-cost sourcing, improved commodity pricing and greater efficiencies from lean manufacturing; achieving a 12 percent to 17 percent reduction in operating expenses; and improving cash flow from operations and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet by lowering inventory.
 
As part of the company's efforts to reduce operating expenses and align production with anticipated product demand, Arctic Cat announced today the elimination of a total of 60 positions, or approximately 5 percent of its 1,200 employees.  Arctic Cat does not expect to record a material charge for the workforce reduction.
 
Commenting on the company's outlook, Twomey said: "We do not expect any meaningful recovery in the recreational products market in the year ahead. Near-term, we are focused on rescaling the business and conservatively managing it to meet anticipated demand. We also are taking appropriate actions to preserve cash for operations and maintain dealer health, as well as developing select innovative products that position Arctic Cat to emerge as a stronger company as the economy recovers."

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 29, 2009  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, on net sales of $69.4 million for the first quarter ended June 30, 2009.  Arctic Cat reported a net loss in the fiscal 2009 first quarter of $7.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $93.9 million.
 
Commenting on the first quarter results, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer Christopher A. Twomey said: "Economic conditions remained difficult during the quarter and continued to affect the recreational products market overall. Given the current recessionary environment, we are pleased with the company's improved results on lower sales. We made significant progress on our goals to reduce our cost structure and strengthen the balance sheet."
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2010 first quarter financial results versus the same quarter last year:
 
                 
Operating expenses declined 23 percent to $16.2 million from $21.0 million;
 
                 
Inventories were reduced 19 percent to
$127.1 million from $156.2 million;
 
                 
Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end increased to $7.9 million from $5.8 million; and
 
                 
The company had no short- or long-term debt versus $12.1 million in short-term debt in the prior-year quarter.
 
"Through strong inventory management, expense controls and a rescaled business, we are on track to deliver improved operating results this fiscal year on lower sales," said Twomey.
 
During the fiscal first quarter, Arctic Cat entered into an amended credit facility agreement on June 17, 2009, that extends the agreement until March 31, 2010, and increases the company's borrowing capacity to $60 million.
 
Business Line Results
 
All-terrain vehicle (
ATV) sales totaled $32.2 million in the first quarter versus $53.8 million in the same period last year, as Arctic Cat rescaled its business to align inventory levels with present wholesale and retail demand.
 
Commented Twomey: "With the current retail ATV sales slump driven by the recession, we are working harder than ever to offer consumers the innovative products they want, in the ATV segments that currently show some signs of improvement." These include special-purpose recreational vehicles, such as Arctic Cat's: side-by-side Prowler utility models; the two-rider TRV; as well as vehicles with large-displacement engines exemplified by Arctic Cat's Thundercat 1000, which remains the industry's most powerful engine. Pursuing this strategy, Arctic Cat expects to maintain or increase its North American ATV market share again this year.
 
Snowmobile sales were $17.9 million
in the first quarter compared to $21.4 million in the prior-year quarter, due to economic factors. Although Arctic Cat anticipates lower worldwide snowmobile orders in fiscal 2010 as a result of the recession, the company expects to maintain or increase its North American market share by continuing to offer consumers leading-edge technologies, such as the new powered up 800cc engine which will be used in models across all market segments and aligns with the company's reputation for offering the world's fastest snowmobiles.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the first quarter were $19.3 million, up from $18.7 million in the prior-year quarter. To help fuel PG&A sales in fiscal 2010, Arctic Cat is expanding its product offerings to generate additional revenue and profit through the company's established dealer network. The company's new PG&A products include the Drift line of snowmobile garments, which is designed to appeal to more price-sensitive shoppers and has the potential to attract new customers. Also new for fiscal 2010 are two lubricant products.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat is implementing operational efficiency initiatives aimed at returning the company to long-term profitability on lower anticipated sales volumes. The company's fiscal 2010 outlook includes the following assumptions: the continuation of the weak global economic environment negatively impacting sales of recreational products; increasing gross margins up to 300 basis points through global low-cost sourcing, improved commodity pricing and greater efficiencies from lean manufacturing; achieving a 12 percent to 17 percent reduction in operating expenses; and improving cash flow from operations and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet by lowering inventory.
Arctic Cat continues to estimate sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, in the range of $425 million to $460 million, based on achieving ATV sales of $188 million to $203 million, snowmobile sales in the range of $140 million to $152 million and PG&A sales of $97 million to $105 million. Arctic Cat has not provided fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance, although the company expects improved per share results compared with fiscal 2009.
 
Commenting on the company's outlook, Twomey said: "We continue to expect that this will be a challenging year for the recreational products industry in this recessionary economic environment. Near-term, we remain focused on conservatively managing our business to meet lower anticipated demand. We are continuing our efforts to improve the company's operational performance. We also are taking appropriate actions to preserve cash and maintain dealer health, as well as developing select innovative products that position Arctic Cat to emerge as a stronger company once the economy recovers."

In order to promote Vendor's sale of Inventory to its Dealers, Vendor has requested that CDF provide financing to its Dealers and has agreed to enter into this Agreement to induce CDF to provide such financing.
 
NOW, THEREFORE,
to induce CDF to extend financing to Vendor's Dealers, Vendor and CDF agree as follows:
 
1.
                                      
Representations and Warranties
.
 
A.
                                  
Whenever a Dealer requests the shipment of Inventory from ACSI and that CDF finance such Inventory, ACSI may deliver to CDF one or more invoices describing the Inventory.  By delivery of an invoice relating to Inventory (for the avoidance of doubt, including but not limited to any Purchased Accounts and the inventory related to such accounts), ACSI represents, warrants and covenants to CDF as follows:
 
(a)
                                 
The invoice issued by ACSI represents a valid obligation of Dealer, is legally enforceable according to its terms, relates to a bona fide sale of Inventory by ACSI to Dealer, as requested by Dealer, and is not subject to any claim, setoff or defense to payment by Dealer; and that Dealer requested that its acquisition of the Inventory be financed by CDF.
 
(b)
                                
ACSI will transfer to Dealer all of its right, title and interest in and to the Inventory so described, contingent only upon CDF's approval to finance the transaction.
 
(c)
                                 
ACSI's title to the Inventory will be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances when transferred to Dealer.
 
(d)
                                
The Inventory is in new (meaning (i) not previously sold at retail or (ii) not registered or titled in any state) and unused condition (excepting for normal wear and tear incidental to demonstration as approved by CDF); it is of the kind, quality and condition represented or warranted to Dealer; it meets or exceeds all applicable federal, state and local safety, construction and other standards; and, if it is a type of Inventory customarily crated or boxed, such crate or box is factory sealed; and the Inventory is in salable condition suitable for ordinary retail sale.
 
If ACSI breaches any of the above representations, warranties or covenants, ACSI will immediately (i) pay to CDF an amount equal to the total unpaid principal balance  and any finance charges owed to CDF on all Inventory related to the breach, and (ii) reimburse CDF for all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by CDF as a result of the breach.
 
B.
                                    
Vendor also represents, warrants and covenants to CDF as follows:
 
(a)
                                 
Due Organization; Authority
.
  Vendor is and will continue to be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its formation, is and will continue to be duly qualified and licensed to do business in every jurisdiction where such qualification or licensing is necessary to carry out its obligations under this Agreement and has and will continue to have the power, authority and legal right to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.
 
(b)
                                
Due Authorization; Enforceability
.  This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Vendor and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Vendor, constitutes its valid and legally
 
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity.
 
(c)
                                 
No Violation
.
  The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the performance by Vendor of its obligations hereunder will not (i) constitute or create a breach of any agreement to which Vendor is a party, (ii) violate or conflict with any provision of its charter or by-laws or other organizational documents, or any law, governmental rule or regulation, judgment or order applicable to it, or any provision of any indenture, mortgage, contract or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its property is bound, (iii) constitute a default under any credit facility or agreement to which it is a party or by which it or its property is bound, or (iv) require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with or the taking of any action in respect of or by, any federal or state governmental authority or agency (including any local governmental authority or agency) or other third party, except as have been duly obtained, given or accomplished and are in full force and effect.
 
2.
                                      
Inventory Financing
.  CDF will only be bound to finance Inventory with respect to which CDF has agreed to finance in the exercise of its sole discretion  and then only if:  (a) ACSI delivers to CDF an invoice, acceptable in form and content to CDF, relating to CDF's agreement/approval within thirty (30) days after CDF issues its agreement/approval; (b) ACSI ships the Inventory to the respective Dealer not more than ten (10) days before or not more than three (3) days after the date of the invoice/EDI transmission relating to such Inventory; and (c) CDF has not revoked its agreement/acceptance before the shipment of the Inventory to Dealer (prior to funding an approval CDF shall have the right to cancel an approval upon oral or written notice to ACSI at any time prior to shipment).  If ACSI fails to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, CDF shall not be obligated to finance the Inventory, even though CDF may have previously agreed to finance such Inventory. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if CDF has not advanced funds with respect to any approval by the date such approval expires, or by such date as CDF and ACSI may have otherwise agreed to, then any invoice relating to such approval shall be deemed not received by CDF and CDF shall have no obligation to finance such invoice. With respect to invoices which satisfy the above conditions CDF shall pay ACSI the amount of the invoice, subject to the terms of the financing program then in effect between ACSI and CDF. CDF may deduct, setoff, withhold and or apply any sums or payments due from Vendor to CDF under this Agreement, any guaranty or due from Vendor to CDF under any other agreement, against any sums due from CDF to Vendor from any advance to be made by CDF against any invoice.
 
3.
                                      
Purchase of Inventory
.  Whenever CDF deems it necessary in its sole discretion to repossess or if CDF otherwise comes into possession, actual or constructive, of any Inventory in which it has a security interest or other lien, including but not limited to any Inventory acquired by a Dealer in replacement of Inventory previously held by Dealer, ACSI will purchase such Inventory from CDF at the time of CDF's repossession or other acquisition of possession thereof in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
 
(a)
                                 
ACSI will purchase such Inventory, regardless of its condition, at the point where CDF repossesses it or where it otherwise comes into CDF's possession;
 
(b)
                                
The purchase price ACSI will pay to CDF for such Inventory will be due and payable immediately in full, and will be an amount equal to the total unpaid principal balance owed to CDF with respect to such Inventory;
 
(c)
                                 
ACSI shall not assert or obtain any interest in or to any Inventory acquired by ACSI until the purchase price therefor is paid in full;
 
(d)
                                
If an invoice delivered to CDF by ACSI does not identify the Inventory covered thereby by serial number, but only by model number, and ACSI cannot prove to CDF's reasonable satisfaction that an item of Inventory is covered by a particular invoice, then for purposes of determining the age or price of an item of Inventory under this Agreement, the item of Inventory shall be deemed to be covered by the most recent invoice which has an item with the same model number as the item of Inventory tendered for purchase by ACSI;
 
(e)
                                 
ACSI hereby agrees that in the event that CDF refinances Inventory for a Dealer by means of a buyout of a Dealer's debt from another financing source or otherwise, such Inventory shall be subject to purchase by ACSI pursuant to the terms of this Agreement notwithstanding the fact that CDF did not finance the initial purchase of such Inventory by Dealer from ACSI;
 
(f)
                                   
The aggregate repurchase obligations for ACSI for Inventory pursuant to of this Agreement shall not exceed the Repurchase Cap per any consecutive twelve-month period with the first period beginning on the Effective Date. "" as used herein shall mean the greater of (i) Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000.00) or (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the ANR (as defined below) of all Dealers for the prior consecutive twelve-month period with the first period beginning on the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the repurchase terms

For purposes of clarity, ACSI's liability pursuant to this  shall be counted towards the cap described in this .  "" as used in this shall mean (a) all indebtedness of any nature of any Dealer  (excluding Tracker Marine Retail, LLC) owed to CDF (as determined on a managed basis without regard for securitization) whether existing or arising hereafter with respect to Inventory, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses, reimbursement obligations or otherwise (as determined on a managed basis without regard for securitization) and (b) all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by CDF in attempting to collect such indebtedness from any Dealer. ACSI will immediately pay to CDF the amount of the guarantied Dealer Liabilities upon receipt of notice from CDF that such Dealer Liabilities exist with respect to any Dealer.  ACSI's guaranty under this is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.   If for any calendar year (beginning with calendar year 2010), CDF's respective share of the aggregate annual loss with respect to the financing program for ACSI's Dealers (excluding Tracker Marine Retail, LLC) as described herein (as determined on a managed basis without regard for securitization) is less than 0.50% of ANR  (as defined above), after giving effect to the loss sharing to be contributed by ACSI for such calendar year, then the difference between CDF's respective share of such annual loss amount and 0.50% of ANR for such calendar year will be shared evenly with the ACSI within 60 days of such calendar year's year-end.  The loss and the ANR for any year during which this Vendor Agreement shall be in effect for only a part of such calendar year shall be prorated.  All determinations of applicable losses shall be based upon CDF's internally calculated profit and loss report, with respect to the financing program for ACSI's Dealers as described herein, as determined by CDF in its sole discretion in accordance with its then current internal cost allocation and accounting policies and procedures, which policies and procedures may change from time to time. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Tracker Marine Retail, LLC shall not be included in any of the calculations set forth in this .

such Dealer Liabilities even if CDF has not (i) notified the applicable Dealer that it is in default, or (ii) exercised any of CDF's rights or remedies against such Dealer, any other person or any current or future collateral.  If any Dealer hereafter undergoes any change in its ownership, identity or organizational structure, this guaranty will extend to all current and future obligations which such new or changed legal entity owes to CDF.  ACSI irrevocably waives any right of notice of the number and amount of advances made by CDF to any Dealer in reliance on this guaranty and any claim or action against any Dealer; all rights of offset against CDF or Dealer; and all defenses to the enforceability of this guaranty (including, without limitation, fraudulent inducement).  ACSI further waives all defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral and defenses which any Dealer may assert on the underlying Dealer Liabilities, including, but not limited to, breach of warranty, fraud, payment of disputed amounts, statute of frauds, bankruptcy, statute of limitations, lender liability and deceptive trade practices.

No modification, waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of this shall be binding upon CDF except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed on CDF's behalf by any authorized officer or agent of CDF and delivered by CDF to ACSI.  CDF's failure at any time to require strict performance by ACSI of any of the provisions contained in this shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of CDF at any time to demand strict performance therewith.

Notwithstanding anything in this to the contrary, the right of recovery against ACSI under this is limited to the extent it is judicially determined with respect to ACSI that entering into this guaranty would violate Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable federal, state or other laws relating to fraudulent transfers or the like, in which case ACSI shall be liable under this only for amounts aggregating up to the largest amount that would not render ACSI's obligations under this subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any such comparable laws

19.
                                
BINDING ARBITRATION
.
 
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship resulting in or from this Agreement, the breach of any duties hereunder or any other relationship, transaction or dealing between the parties (collectively "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of either:
 
(a) The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"); or (b) United States Arbitration & Mediation ("USA&M").  Any arbitration proceeding must be instituted, with respect to any Dispute, within two (2) years after the date the incident giving rise thereto occurred, whether or not any damage was sustained or capable of ascertainment or either party knew of such incident.  Failure to institute an arbitration proceeding within such period will constitute an absolute bar and waiver to the institution of any proceeding, whether arbitration or a court proceeding, with respect to such Dispute.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this limitations provision will be suspended temporarily as of the date any of the following events occur with respect to Dealer or either party hereto and will not resume until the date the Dealer or either party hereto is no longer subject to:  (i) bankruptcy, (ii) receivership, (iii) any proceeding regarding an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (iv) any legal proceeding, civil or criminal, which prohibits Dealer or either party from foreclosing any interest it might have in the collateral of the other party.  The party first filing an arbitration claim shall designate which arbitration forum and rules are to be applied for all disputes between the parties.  The arbitration rules are found at www.adr.org for AAA, and at www.usam-midwest.com for USA&M.  AAA claims may be filed in any AAA office.  Claims filed with USA&M shall be filed in its Midwest office located at 720 Olive Street, Suite 2020, St. Louis, Missouri 63101.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that either party may pursue claims against the other that do not exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) in the aggregate in a court of competent jurisdiction.  Except as otherwise stated herein, all notices, arbitration claims, responses, requests and documents will be sufficiently given or served if mailed or delivered: (a) to CDF at 5595 Trillium Boulevard, Hoffman Estates, Illinois. 60192, Attention:  General Counsel; and (b) to any other party at the address specified herein; or such other address as the parties may specify from time to time in writing.  The parties agree that all arbitrators selected will be attorneys with at least five (5) years secured transactions experience.  A panel of three arbitrators shall hear all claims exceeding One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), exclusive of interest, costs and attorneys' fees.  Each party hereby consents to a documentary hearing for all arbitration claims, by submitting the dispute to the arbitrator(s) by written briefs and affidavits, along with relevant documents.  However, arbitration claims will be submitted by way of an oral hearing, if any party requests an oral hearing within forty (40) days after service of the claim, and that party remits the appropriate deposit for AAA's fees and arbitrator compensation within ten (10) days of making the request.  Each party agrees that failure to timely pay all fees and arbitrator compensation billed to the party requesting the oral hearing will be deemed such party's consent to submitting the Dispute to the arbitrator on documents and such party's waiver of its request for oral hearing. The site of all oral arbitration hearings will be in the Division of the Federal Judicial District in which AAA or USA&M maintains a regional office that is closest to Vendor.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment or order and confirmed or enforced by either party in any state or federal court having competent jurisdiction thereof.  Nothing herein will be construed to prevent CDF's or Vendor's use of bankruptcy, receivership, injunction, repossession, replevin, claim and delivery, sequestration, seizure, attachment, foreclosure, and/or any other prejudgment or provisional action or remedy relating to any Inventory for any current or future debt owed by either party to the other.  Any such action or remedy will not waive CDF's or Vendor's right to compel arbitration of any Dispute.  The non-prevailing party will pay all of the costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the prevailing party in any arbitration proceeding.  If either party brings or appeals any judicial action to vacate or modify any award rendered pursuant to arbitration or opposes the confirmation of such award and the party bringing or appealing such action or opposing confirmation of such award does not prevail, such party will pay all of the costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, arbitrators fees and expenses and attorneys' fees) incurred by the other party in defending such action.  Additionally, if either party brings any action for judicial relief in the first instance without pursuing arbitration prior thereto, the party bringing such action for judicial relief will be liable for and will immediately pay to the other party all of the other party's costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees) to stay or dismiss such judicial action and/or remove it to arbitration.  The failure of either party to exercise any rights granted hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of any of those rights. This Agreement concerns transactions involving commerce among the several states.  The arbitrators will not be empowered to award exemplary or punitive damages.  The arbitrator(s) will decide if any inconsistency exists between the rules of the applicable arbitral forum and the arbitration provisions contained herein.  If such inconsistency exists, the arbitration provisions contained herein will control and supersede such rules. The agreement to arbitrate will survive termination of this Agreement.
 
20.
                              
JURY TRIAL WAIVER; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; PUNITIVE DAMAGE WAIVER
. IF THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE WILL BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE WITHOUT A JURY. VENDOR AND CDF WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING. SIMILARLY, IF THIS AGREEMENT OR A PARTICULAR DISPUTE HEREUNDER IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, VENDOR HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY LOCAL, STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN ILLINOIS AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH VENDOR MAY HAVE BASED ON IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS TO THE CONDUCT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT. VENDOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AGAINST CDF IN ANY PROCEEDING OR AWARD, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION.
 
21.
                              
GOVERNING LAW
. THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WILL GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL TRANSACTIONS HEREUNDER AS TO INTERPRETATION, ENFORCEMENT, VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT AND IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT
 
("FAA"), TO THE EXTENT INCONSISTENT, WILL SUPERSEDE THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE AND GOVERN ALL ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
the parties have entered into this Agreement as of the date first written above.

(NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported net earnings of $14.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, on net sales of $166.3 million for the second quarter ended September 30, 2009. Arctic Cat reported net earnings in the fiscal 2008 second quarter of $16.9 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, on net sales of $204.3 million.
 
For the six months ended September 30, 2009, Arctic Cat's net earnings were $8.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, on net sales of $235.7 million. In the first six months of last year, the company reported net earnings of $10.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, on net sales of $298.2 million.
 
Commented Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer Christopher A. Twomey: "We continued to face difficult selling conditions during the second quarter, given the global economic environment. Despite this, we are pleased with the company's continued progress on our goals to reduce the company's cost structure and strengthen the balance sheet."
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2010 second quarter financial results versus the same quarter last year:
 
                 
Gross margins increased 410 basis points in the quarter and 230 basis points year to date;
                 
Operating expenses declined 12 percent to $23.3 million from $26.6 million, and fell 17 percent year-to-date;
                 
Operating profit rose 7 percent to $21.9 million from $20.5 million;
                 
Inventories were reduced 23 percent to
$133.6 million from $172.3 million;
                 
Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end rose to $11.2 million from $3.7 million; and
                 
The company had no short-term debt at quarter end compared to $14.8 million a year ago.
 
"Through strong inventory management, expense controls and a rescaled business, we continue to remain on track to deliver improved operating results this fiscal year on lower sales,"
 
said Twomey.
 
Arctic Cat announced on October 20, 2009 that the company has entered into an agreement for GE Capital, Commercial Distribution Finance to become the exclusive provider of floorplan financing for Arctic Cat's U.S. dealers. The new multi-year financing program will replace Arctic Cat's current financing agreement with Textron Financial Corporation, which had previously announced its intent to exit the dealer floorplan business. The new financing program is expected to begin December 1, 2009.
 
"We are very pleased to partner with GE Capital, and we expect that this agreement will continue to provide our ATV and snowmobile dealers with innovative financing programs and superior service," said Twomey.
 
Business Line Results
 
"Our continued focus on achieving our operating efficiency initiatives has enabled Arctic Cat to increase our gross margin percentage, despite lower demand for recreational vehicle products at this time," said Twomey. "We expect that Arctic Cat will be well-positioned as a stronger, leaner company as our markets recover."
 
Snowmobile sales totaled $85.7 million
in the second quarter compared to $98.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Year to date, snowmobile sales were $103.7 million versus $119.8 million in the same period last year. Although Arctic Cat continues to anticipate lower worldwide snowmobile orders in fiscal 2010 as a result of the recession, the company expects to maintain or increase its North American market share by offering consumers leading-edge technologies, such as the new powered up 800cc engine that is being used in its models across all market segments.
 
All-terrain vehicle (
ATV) sales totaled $51.7 million in the second quarter versus $71.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Year to date ATV sales were $83.9 million compared to $125.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2009. With retail industry ATV sales continuing to decline during the recession, Arctic Cat has worked to reduce dealer inventories and, at the same time, increase market share.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the second quarter totaled $28.8 million versus $34.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Year to date, PG&A sales were $48.1 million compared to $52.9 million in the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat is implementing operational efficiency initiatives aimed at returning the company to long-term profitability on lower anticipated sales volumes. The company's fiscal 2010
outlook includes the following assumptions: the continuation of the weak global economic environment negatively impacting sales of recreational products; increasing gross margins up to 300 basis points through global low-cost sourcing, improved commodity pricing and greater efficiencies from lean manufacturing; achieving a 12 percent to 17 percent reduction in operating expenses; improving cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet by lowering inventory.
 
Arctic Cat continues to estimate sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 in the range of $425 million to $460 million, based on achieving ATV sales of $188 million to $203 million, snowmobile sales in the range of $140 million to $152 million and PG&A sales of $97 million to $105 million. Arctic Cat has not provided fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance, although the company expects improved per share results compared with fiscal 2009.
 
Commenting on the company's outlook, Twomey said: "This is a challenging year for the recreational products industry. Near-term, we remain focused on conservatively managing our business to meet lower anticipated demand. We are continuing our efforts to improve the company's operational performance. We also are taking appropriate actions to preserve cash and maintain dealer health, as well as developing select innovative products that position Arctic Cat to emerge as a stronger company once the economy recovers."

Notice of Borrowing
 
(a)           Whenever Borrowers desire funding of a Borrowing of Revolver Loans, Borrower Agent shall give Agent a Notice of Borrowing.  Such notice must be received by Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the Business Day of the requested funding date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and (ii) at least three Business Days prior to the requested funding date, in the case of LIBOR Loans.  Notices received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.  Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) the amount of the Borrowing, (B) the requested funding date (which must be a Business Day), (C) whether the Borrowing is to be made as Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, and (D) in the case of LIBOR Loans, the duration of the applicable Interest Period (which shall be deemed to be 30 days if not specified).
 
(b)           Unless payment is otherwise timely made by Borrowers, the becoming due of any Obligations (whether principal, interest, fees or other charges, including Extraordinary Expenses, LC Obligations, Cash Collateral and Bank Product Debt) shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans on the due date, in the amount of such Obligations.  The proceeds of such Revolver Loans shall be disbursed as direct payment of the relevant Obligation.  In addition, Agent may, at its option, charge such Obligations against any operating, investment or other account of a Borrower maintained with Agent or any of its Affiliates.
 
(c)           If Borrowers establish a controlled disbursement account with Agent or any Affiliate of Agent, then the presentation for payment of any check or other item of payment drawn on such account at a time when there are insufficient funds to cover it shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans on the date of such presentation, in the amount of the check and items presented for payment.  The proceeds of such Revolver Loans may be disbursed directly to the controlled disbursement account or other appropriate account.
 
 
4.1.2.          .  Each Lender shall timely honor its Revolver Commitment by funding its Pro Rata share of each Borrowing of Revolver Loans that is properly requested hereunder.  Except for Borrowings to be made as Swingline Loans, Agent shall endeavor to notify Lenders of each Notice of Borrowing (or deemed request for a Borrowing) by 12:00 noon on the proposed funding date for Base Rate Loans or by 3:00 p.m. at least two Business Days before any proposed funding of LIBOR Loans.  Each Lender shall fund to Agent such Lender's Pro Rata share of the Borrowing to the account specified by Agent in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested funding date, unless Agent's notice is received after the times provided above, in which event Lender shall fund its Pro Rata share by 11:00 a.m. on the next Business Day.  Subject to its receipt of such amounts from Lenders, Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Revolver Loans as directed by Borrower Agent.  Unless Agent shall have received (in sufficient time to act) written notice from a Lender that it does not intend to fund its Pro Rata share of a Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has deposited or promptly will deposit its share with Agent, and Agent may disburse a corresponding amount to Borrowers.  If a Lender's share of any Borrowing is not in fact received by Agent, then Borrowers agree to repay to Agent the amount of such share, together with interest thereon from the date disbursed until repaid, at the rate applicable to such Borrowing.

Each Swingline Loan shall constitute a Revolver Loan for all purposes, except that payments thereon shall be made to Agent for its own account.  The obligation of Borrowers to repay Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by the records of Agent and need not be evidenced by any promissory note.
 
(b)           To facilitate administration of the Revolver Loans, Lenders and Agent agree (which agreement is solely among them, and not for the benefit of or enforceable by any Borrower) that settlement among them with respect to Swingline Loans and other Revolver Loans may take place periodically on a date determined from time to time by Agent, which shall occur at least once each week.  On each settlement date, settlement shall be made with each Lender in accordance with the Settlement Report delivered by Agent to Lenders.  Between settlement dates, Agent may in its discretion apply payments on Revolver Loans to Swingline Loans, regardless of any designation by Borrower or any provision herein to the contrary.  Each Lender's obligation to make settlements with Agent is absolute and unconditional, without offset, counterclaim or other defense, and whether or not the Revolver Commitments have terminated, an Overadvance exists or the conditions in are satisfied.  If, due to an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to a Borrower or otherwise, any Swingline Loan may not be settled among Lenders hereunder, then each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased from Agent a Pro Rata participation in each unpaid Swingline Loan and shall transfer the amount of such participation to Agent, in immediately available funds, within one Business Day after Agent's request therefor.

Borrowers shall confirm each such request by prompt delivery to Agent of a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, if applicable, but if it differs in any material respect from the action taken by Agent or Lenders, the records of Agent and Lenders shall govern.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability for any loss suffered by a Borrower as a result of Agent or any Lender acting upon its understanding of telephonic or e-mailed instructions from a person believed in good faith by Agent or any Lender to be a person authorized to give such instructions on a Borrower's behalf.

The failure of any Lender to fund a Loan, to make any payment in respect of LC Obligations, or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations, and no Lender shall be responsible for default by another Lender.  Lenders and Agent agree (which agreement is solely among them, and not for the benefit of or enforceable by any Borrower or any other Obligor) that, solely for purposes of determining a Defaulting Lender's right to vote on matters relating to the Loan Documents and to share in payments, fees and Collateral proceeds thereunder, a Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to be a "Lender" until all its defaulted obligations have been cured.

The allocations set forth in this Section are solely to determine the rights and priorities of Agent and Lenders as among themselves, and may be changed by agreement among them without the consent of any Obligor.  This Section is not for the benefit of or enforceable by any Borrower or any other Obligor.
 
5.5.2.
         
Erroneous Application
.  Agent shall not be liable for any application of amounts made by it in good faith and, if any such application is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender or other Person to which such amount should have been made shall be to recover the amount from the Person that actually received it (and, if such amount was received by any Lender, such Lender hereby agrees to return it).
 
5.6.
        
Application of Payments
.
  The ledger balance in the main Dominion Account as of the end of a Business Day shall be applied to the Obligations at the beginning of the next Business Day.  If, as a result of such application, a credit balance exists, the balance shall not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers and shall be made available to Borrowers in its operating account as long as no Default or
Event of Default exists and no Revolver Loans are outstanding.  Each Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any payments or Collateral proceeds, and agrees that Agent shall have the continuing, exclusive right to apply and reapply same against the Obligations, in such manner as Agent deems advisable, notwithstanding any entry by Agent in its records.
 
5.7.
        
Loan Account; Account Stated

Loan Account
.  Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual and customary practices an account or accounts ("") evidencing the Debt of Borrowers resulting from each Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit from time to time.  Any failure of Agent to record anything in the Loan Account, or any error in doing so, shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrowers to pay any amount owing hereunder.  Agent may maintain a single Loan Account in the name of Borrower Agent, and each Borrower confirms that such arrangement shall have no effect on the joint and several character of its liability for the Obligations.
Loan Account
 
5.7.2.
         
Entries Binding
.  Entries made in the Loan Account shall constitute presumptive evidence of the information contained therein.  If any information contained in the Loan Account is provided to or inspected by any Person, then such information shall be conclusive and binding on such Person for all purposes absent manifest error, except to the extent such Person notifies Agent in writing within 30 days after receipt or inspection that specific information is subject to dispute.
 
5.8.
        
Taxes
.
 
5.8.1.
         
Payments Free of Taxes
.  Any and all payments by any Obligor on account of any Obligations shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if an Obligor shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (b) the Obligor shall make such deductions; and (c) Borrowers shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.  Without limiting the foregoing, Borrowers shall timely pay all Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower Agent by a Lender or Issuing Bank (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower, Borrower Agent shall deliver to Agent a receipt issued by the Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Agent.
 
5.9.

5.9.1.
         
Exemption
.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which an Obligor is resident for tax
purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to Agent and Borrower Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Agent or Borrower Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by Agent or Borrower Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Agent or Borrower Agent as will enable Agent and Borrower Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
 
5.9.2.
         
Documentation
.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, a Foreign Lender shall deliver to Agent and Borrower Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender hereunder (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of Agent or Borrower Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), (a) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; (b) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (c) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (i) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of any Obligor within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and (ii) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN; or (d) any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax, duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit Borrowers to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

Nature and Extent of Each Borrower's Liability
.
 
5.10.1.
       
Joint and Several Liability
.  Each Borrower agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Agent and Lenders the prompt payment and performance of, all Obligations and all other agreements of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligations hereunder constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection, that such obligations shall not be discharged until Full Payment of the Obligations, and that such obligations are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability, subordination or any future modification of, or change in, any Obligations or Loan Document, or any other document, instrument or agreement to which any Obligor is or may become a party or be bound; (b) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section) or any other Loan Document, or any waiver, consent or indulgence of any kind by Agent or any Lender with respect thereto; (c) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect a Lien or to preserve rights against, any security or guaranty for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by Agent or any Lender in respect thereof (including the release of any security or guaranty); (d) the insolvency of any Obligor; (e) any election by Agent or any Lender in an Insolvency Proceeding for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (f) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; (g) the disallowance of any claims of Agent or any Lender against any Obligor for the repayment of any Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; or (h) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, except Full Payment of all Obligations.
5.10.2.
       
Waivers
.
 
(a)
          
Each Borrower expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel Agent or Lenders to marshal assets or to proceed against any Obligor, other Person or security for the payment or performance of any Obligations before, or as a condition to, proceeding against such Borrower.  Each Borrower waives all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor other than Full Payment of all Obligations.  It is agreed among each Borrower, Agent and Lenders that the provisions of this are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and that, but for such provisions, Agent and Lenders would decline to make Loans and issue Letters of Credit.  Each Borrower acknowledges that its guaranty pursuant to this Section is necessary to the conduct and promotion of its business, and can be expected to benefit such business.
Section 5.10
 
(b)
          
Agent and Lenders may, in their discretion, pursue such rights and remedies as they deem appropriate, including realization upon Collateral or any Real Estate by judicial foreclosure or non-judicial sale or enforcement, without affecting any rights and remedies under this .  If, in taking any action in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or otherwise, each Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that any Borrower might otherwise have had.  Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations.  Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower's rights of subrogation against any other Person.  Agent may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent but shall be credited against the Obligations.  The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent or any other Person is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.
Section 5.10

5.10.3.
       
Extent of Liability; Contribution

Section 5.10
 
(b)
          
If any Borrower makes a payment under this of any Obligations (other than amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable) (a "") that, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount that such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payments in the same proportion that such Borrower's Allocable Amount bore to the total Allocable Amounts of all Borrowers, then such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and to be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.  The "" for any Borrower shall be the maximum amount that could then be recovered from such Borrower under this without

Guarantor Payment
Allocable Amount
Section 5.10
rendering such payment voidable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state fraudulent transfer or conveyance act, or similar statute or common law.
 
(c)
          
Nothing contained in this shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay Loans made directly or indirectly to that Borrower (including Loans advanced to any other Borrower and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred to, or for the benefit of, such Borrower), LC Obligations relating to Letters of Credit issued to support such Borrower's business, and all accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder.  Agent and Lenders shall have the right, at any time in their discretion, to condition Loans and Letters of Credit upon a separate calculation of borrowing availability for each Borrower and to restrict the disbursement and use of such Loans and Letters of Credit to such Borrower.

Borrowers acknowledge and agree that Agent's and Lenders' willingness to extend credit to Borrowers and to administer the Collateral on a combined basis, as set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at Borrowers' request.
 
5.10.5.
       
Subordination
.

Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act until it has received such instructions or assurances, and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.  Instructions of Required Lenders shall be binding upon all Lenders, and no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders.

99.1  Press release issued on January 27, 2010, regarding the registrant's results of operations for the third quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, January 27, 2010  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported net earnings of $2.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, on net sales of $131.0 million for the third quarter ended December 31, 2009. Arctic Cat reported a net loss in the prior-year third quarter of $2.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, on net sales of $174.7 million.
 
In the first nine months, Arctic Cat reported net earnings of $11.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to prior-year net earnings of $7.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. Arctic Cat's net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2010 totaled $366.7 million versus $472.9 million in the same period last year.
 
Commented Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer Christopher A. Twomey: "We are pleased with the company's further progress in delivering improved operating results during the third quarter and year to date, particularly given the continued difficult selling conditions in the power sports market. Our focus on lowering Arctic Cat's cost structure through lean manufacturing efficiencies, low-cost sourcing and expense controls led to higher gross margins and operating profits. In addition, our efforts to reduce inventories resulted in a much stronger balance sheet."
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2010 third-quarter and year-to-date financial results versus the same period last year:
 
 
                
Gross margins increased 550 basis points and 350 basis points year to date;
                
Operating expenses declined 9 percent to $22.0 million from $24.2 million, and fell 14 percent year to date;
                
Operating profit for the quarter jumped $4.5 million to $624,000 from a loss of $3.9 million; operating profit is up 63 percent year to date;
                
Inventories were reduced 29 percent to
$106.3 million from $150.4 million;
                
Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end rose to $50.4 million up from $5.4 million; and
                
The company had no short- or long-term debt at quarter end.
 
During the third quarter, Arctic Cat announced on October 20, 2009, that it entered into an agreement for GE Capital, Commercial Distribution Finance to become the exclusive provider of floorplan financing for Arctic Cat's U.S. dealers. The new multi-year financing program replaces Arctic Cat's financing agreement with Textron Financial Corporation, which is exiting the dealer floorplan business.
 
Arctic Cat also announced on November 12, 2009, a new three-year, $60 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The facility is available for the company's ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Bank of America, N.A., structured and underwrote the new facility, which
replaces an existing credit facility that was scheduled to expire in March 2010.
 
Business Line Results
 
"We are successfully rescaling Arctic Cat's business to achieve improved profitability in the current lower-demand environment for recreational products," said Twomey.
"A key part of our strategy this fiscal year has been to reduce dealer inventories, in order to position the company for future growth when the retail power sports market recovers."  Year to date, Arctic Cat's overall dealer inventories are down 19 percent.
 
Snowmobile sales totaled $58.7 million
in the third quarter compared to $90.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date Arctic Cat snowmobile sales were $162.3 million versus $210.7 million in the same period last year. While overall North American retail snowmobile sales for the industry are down year to date, Arctic Cat's retail sales have outperformed the industry and the company has gained market share. Arctic Cat has increased its North American market share by offering consumers leading-edge technologies, such as the new
 
powered-up 800cc engine that is being introduced in its new models across all market segments.
 
All-terrain vehicle (
ATV) sales totaled $48.2 million in the third quarter versus $57.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date ATV sales were $132.1 million compared to $183.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2009. The economic slowdown over the past year has resulted in lower industry wide retail sales of ATVs, although Arctic Cat's retail ATV sales have outperformed the industry and the company has gained market share. During the current fiscal year, the company has launched seven new 2010 ATV models and is introducing power steering on select units in the fourth quarter.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the second quarter totaled $24.2 million versus $26.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date PG&A sales were $72.3 million compared to $79.1 million in the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
Arctic Cat is implementing operational efficiency initiatives aimed at returning the company to long-term profitability on lower anticipated sales volumes. The company's fiscal 2010 outlook includes the following assumptions: the continuation of the weak global economic environment negatively impacting sales of recreational products; increasing gross margins up to 300 basis points through global low-cost sourcing, improved commodity pricing and greater efficiencies from lean manufacturing; achieving a 12 percent to 17 percent reduction in operating expenses; improving cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet by lowering inventory.
 
Arctic Cat continues to estimate sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, in the range of $425 million to $460 million. The company has not provided fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance, although it expects improved per share results compared with fiscal 2009.
 
"We remain focused on achieving continued operational efficiencies and are on track to deliver improved operating results this fiscal year on anticipated lower sales," said Twomey.

Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end rose to $71.1 million up from $11.4 million; and
 
                 
The company had no short- or long-term debt at quarter end.
 
Business Line Results
 
Arctic Cat continued its strategy to rescale the business, gain market share and reduce dealer inventories, in order to achieve improved profitability in a weak recreational products market. While t
he recession in the past year resulted in lower industry wide retail sales of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and snowmobiles, Arctic Cat's retail sales in both of these product segments continued to outperform the industry and the company gained ATV and snowmobile market share.
 
ATV sales totaled $55.8 million in the fourth quarter versus $64.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Full year ATV sales were $188.0 million compared to $247.3 million in fiscal 2009. The company's ATV sales benefited from its introduction of power steering on select ATV units in the 2010 fourth quarter. Arctic Cat also plans to introduce a new exciting 2011 model in the ATV product group during its fiscal 2011 first quarter.
 
Snowmobile sales increased to $597,000
in the 2010 fourth quarter. Arctic Cat's prior-year fourth quarter snowmobile sales were
a negative $3.4 million, mainly due to sales incentives.
Full-year snowmobile sales were $162.9 million versus $207.3 million last year. Arctic Cat increased its North American market share by offering consumers leading-edge technologies, such as the new powered-up 800cc engine, that was introduced in 2010 models across all market segments. As a result, Arctic Cat's new 2010 model M8 mountain snowmobile became the United States' #1 selling sled in its class.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fourth quarter totaled $27.6 million versus $30.0 million in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2010, PG&A sales were $99.9 million compared to $109.0 million in the prior year.
 
Outlook
 
"We are pleased with our progress in returning Arctic Cat to profitability in fiscal 2010, and we expect further improvement in fiscal 2011," Twomey said.
"Arctic Cat is better positioned today
for long-term growth when the retail powersports market recovers."
 
Arctic Cat remains focused on leveraging its operational efficiency and improving its profitability in a continued low-demand recreational vehicle market.
 
The company's fiscal 2011 outlook includes the following assumptions: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 10 to 12 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales in a range of up or down approximately 5 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories declining 25 to 30 percent; increasing gross margins between 100 to 200 basis points; achieving flat operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet.
 
Arctic Cat estimates sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, in the range of $447 million to $460 million. The company anticipates that fiscal 2011 earnings will be in the range of $0.18 to $0.33 per diluted share.
 
"We are confident that our strategies will enable Arctic Cat to deliver improved operating results again this fiscal year, despite what is expected to be a continued challenging retail marketplace," said Twomey.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, June 10, 2010  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to transition its snowmobile engine manufacturing from Suzuki Motor Corporation. Arctic Cat will begin manufacturing some of its own snowmobile engines in St. Cloud, Minn., after the 2014 model year. Currently, Suzuki supplies all engines for Arctic Cat's snowmobiles. Suzuki will continue to supply the company with engine parts to service existing engines after the 2014 model year.
 
Commented Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer Christopher A. Twomey: "Suzuki has been an outstanding engine supply partner for more than 25 years and remains a significant shareholder in Arctic Cat. However, we are changing our engine strategy in order to gain more control over our products, and enhance our ability to meet regulatory and performance requirements. This also will enable us to better utilize our current engine manufacturing capacity, resulting in potentially better costs."
 
Twomey added: "Our St. Cloud engine facility has been a great addition for the company since we began manufacturing our ATV engines there in 2007."
 
The 56,000-square- foot plant is located on 15 acres and currently employees 41 people. At this time, the company plans to use existing plant capacity and personnel during the transition. Arctic Cat
expects snowmobile engine production to begin in St. Cloud in fiscal 2015.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 29, 2010  Arctic Cat Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAT) today reported that its net loss narrowed to $4.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on net sales of $63.4 million for the fiscal 2011 first quarter ended June 30, 2010.  In the prior-year first quarter of fiscal 2010, Arctic Cat reported a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, on net sales of $69.4 million. The company historically reports a net loss in its fiscal first quarter, due to the seasonal nature of its products, with the majority of its sales and earnings occurring in its fiscal second and third quarters.
 
Commenting on the first quarter results, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer Christopher A. Twomey said: "We are pleased with the company's improved results. Overall, we have made remarkable strides given that the powersports sector has yet to recover from the economic recession. During the quarter, we achieved higher gross margins on lower sales volumes and further strengthened our balance sheet. We made additional progress on our strategy to closely match wholesale and retail sales, in order to reduce dealer inventories and align them with current consumer demand in our markets. We gained ATV market share by offering innovative world-class products. We also continued to aggressively work on lowering our cost structure."
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2011 first quarter financial results versus the same quarter last year:
 
                 
North American dealer inventories declined 23 percent;
                 
Gained ATV market share;
                 
Gross margins improved 610 basis points;
                 
Factory inventory declined 31 percent to
$88.1 million from $127.1 million;
                 
Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end rose to $58.6 million from $7.9 million;  and
                 
The company has no short or long-term debt.
 
Business Line Results
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales totaled $27.8 million in the first quarter versus $32.2 million in the same period last year. Arctic Cat continued to match wholesale sales with actual retail demand in order to further reduce dealer inventories.  At the same time, the company pursued its strategy to introduce new models and features in the ATV segments with the greatest consumer demand.
 
In the first quarter, Arctic Cat introduced two side-by-side Prowler utility vehicles for the 2011 model year: the Prowler HDX and the Prowler 550 XT. The three-passenger Prowler HDX is designed to be a heavy-duty utility workhorse. Its versatile rear cargo box hauls up to 1,000 lbs. and offers removable sides to create a convenient flatbed. In addition, power steering and an extra long wheelbase give it a smooth, comfortable ride. For the newly introduced Prowler 550 XT, Arctic Cat offers a sporty new look. Arctic Cat also extended its critically acclaimed electric power steering package, among other feature enhancements, to additional ATV models, including Arctic Cat's two-rider TRVs.
 
Snowmobile sales totaled $17.1 million in the first quarter compared to $17.9 million in the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, Arctic Cat announced that it entered into an agreement to transition its snowmobile engine manufacturing from Suzuki Motor Corporation. Arctic Cat will begin manufacturing some of its own snowmobile engines at its engine manufacturing facility in St. Cloud, Minn., after the 2014 model year. Currently, Suzuki supplies all engines for Arctic Cat's snowmobiles.
 
In making the announcement, Twomey noted: "Suzuki has been an outstanding engine supply partner for more than 25 years and remains a significant shareholder in Arctic Cat. However, we are changing our engine strategy in order to gain more control over our products, and enhance our ability to meet regulatory and performance requirements. This also will enable us to better utilize our current engine manufacturing capacity, which should result in lower costs."
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the first quarter were $18.5 million versus $19.3 million in the prior-year quarter. To help fuel PG&A sales in fiscal 2011, Arctic Cat is continuing to expand its new accessories and garment offerings to generate additional revenue and earnings.
 
Outlook
 
"Through a rescaled business and strong expense controls, we are on track to deliver improved operating results and increased profitability again this fiscal year," Twomey said.
Arctic Cat is focused on leveraging its operational efficiency and improving its profitability in a continued low-demand recreational vehicle market. The company's fiscal 2011 outlook includes the following assumptions: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 10 to 12 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales in a range of up or down approximately 5 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories declining 20 to 30 percent; increasing gross margins between 100 to 200 basis points; achieving flat operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet.
 
Arctic Cat continues to estimate sales for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, in the range of $447 million to $460 million. The company anticipates that fiscal 2011 earnings will be in the range of $0.18 to $0.33 per diluted share.
 
Commented Twomey: "Arctic Cat remains positioned for long-term growth when the retail powersports market recovers."

Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 28, 2010  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) announced today that Christopher Twomey, 62, plans to retire as chief executive officer at the end of December 2010. He will continue to serve as executive board chair to ensure a smooth transition. The company named Claude Jordan, 54, to succeed Twomey as president and chief executive officer on January 1, 2011.
 
The company's leadership succession plan accommodates Twomey's decision to retire after serving as Arctic Cat's CEO for 24 years. He became president and CEO in 1986, was named a director of the company in 1987 and assumed the board chair position in 2003. During his tenure, Twomey led Arctic Cat through an initial public offering in 1990, increased the number of employees from 99 to more than 1,300 people, and grew revenues from $7.5 million to more than $450 million in fiscal 2010. Under Twomey's leadership, Arctic Cat also entered the all-terrain vehicle (ATV) business, which now accounts for the largest percent of the company's revenues. Twomey's contributions to the industry were recognized by his being named to the Snowmobile Hall of Fame in 2008.
 
"First, the board wants to thank Chris for his leadership of the company for more than two decades. He built Arctic Cat into a market leader in the power sports industry, and is leaving the company in strong financial shape with an outstanding team. We look forward to continuing to work with Chris as board chair," said Kenneth Roering, lead director of Arctic Cat's board. "The board also congratulates Claude on his new role. He has a proven record of success at Arctic Cat and a deep understanding of the company's business. We are confident in his ability to continue to profitably grow the company and enhance shareholder value."
 
Jordan joined Arctic Cat as president and chief operating officer in 2008, and was elected to the company's board of directors in August 2010. During that time, Jordan has been responsible for Arctic Cat's operations and has led the company's ATV business for the past two years, implementing significant product line changes and increasing Arctic Cat's ATV market share.
Twomey commented: "During the past two years, Claude played a significant role in the company's return to profitability, despite a recession that hit the power sports industry hard. His understanding, energy and passion for this business will serve Arctic Cat well."
 
"I'm excited to build upon Arctic Cat's strong reputation, and I look forward to working with our dedicated employees to grow this business," Jordan stated. "My initial priorities are to continue carrying out Arctic Cat's strategic plan and to further enhance the company's profitability and operational efficiency. Arctic Cat is well-positioned for success. We have the vision, proven strategies and talented people to achieve our long-term goals."
 
Before joining Arctic Cat, Jordan was employed most recently in executive positions with The Home Depot and General Electric. Jordan served as vice president of The Home Depot and president/general manager of its THD At-Home Services, Inc. business from 2003 until 2008.
 
Prior to that, Jordan was with General Electric Company from 1998 to 2003. During his last four years with General Electric, he served as president and CEO of GE Water Technologies, a worldwide water treatment manufacturing, sales and services business. Before heading GE Water Technologies, Jordan spent a year in business development with GE Power Systems, managing mergers and acquisitions for new initiatives.
 
Jordan earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., a master's degree from Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and an M.B.A. from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, January 27, 2011  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported net earnings of $9.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, on net sales of $152.0 million for the fiscal 2011 third quarter ended December 31, 2010. Arctic Cat reported net earnings in the prior-year third quarter of $2.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, on net sales of $131.0 million.
 
For the nine months ended December 31, 2010, Arctic Cat's net earnings were $22.6   million, or $1.22 per diluted share, on net sales of $391.2 million. In the first nine months of last fiscal year, the company reported net earnings of $11.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, on net sales of $366.7 million.
 
Commented Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer Claude Jordan: "We are very pleased with the company's strong third-quarter and year-to-date performance. Our results were fueled by higher sales across all product lines, including double-digit gains in our snowmobile business. The combination of increased volume, product mix, product cost-reduction efforts, higher selling prices and a continued focus on efficiency led to another quarter of significantly improved gross margins and profitability."
 
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2011 third quarter and year-to-date financial results versus the same periods last year:
 
                 
Gross margins improved 430 basis points in the quarter and 370 basis points year to date;
 
                 
Operating profit for the quarter rose to $12.2 million from $0.6 million, and year to date increased to $32.7 million from $13.9 million;
 
                 
Factory inventory declined 27 percent to
$77.2 million from $106.3 million;
 
                 
Total cash and short-term investments rose to $107.1 million from $50.4  million; and
 
                 
The company has no short- or long-term debt.
 
"We are excited by the traction and momentum we've achieved year to date," said Jordan. "We continued to successfully execute against our objectives to reduce dealer and factory inventory, improve gross margins and keep operating expenses flat as a percent of sales."
 
 
Business Line Results
 
Snowmobile sales grew 33 percent to $77.8 million in the third quarter compared to $58.7 million in the prior-year quarter, led by increases in both North American dealer sales and international sales to distributors. Year-to-date snowmobile sales increased 15 percent to $186.5 million versus $162.3 million in the same period last year, led by higher international sales to distributors.
 
All-terrain vehicle (ATV) sales rose 1 percent to $48.6 million in the third quarter versus $48.2 million in the prior-year quarter, chiefly driven by sales of the company's new Prowler HDX heavy duty utility vehicle. During the quarter, Arctic Cat announced the launch of three all-new 2011 ATV models: the full-featured, value-priced 350 4X4 automatic; the valued-priced 425 EFI 4X4 automatic; and the XC450i 4X4, a crossover model for consumers seeking four-wheel-drive capabilities in a sport ATV. Arctic Cat's year-to-date ATV sales were up 1 percent to $133.0 million compared to $132.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
 
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the third quarter grew 6 percent to $25.6 million versus $24.2 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by stronger garments sales including the new Drift garment line. Year-to-date PG&A sales totaled $71.7 million, down 1 percent from $72.3 million in the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
"We remain confident that the company is on track to deliver improved operating results, increased profitability and enhanced shareholder value again this fiscal year," Jordan said.
 
Arctic Cat is focused on improving its profitability in a continued low-demand recreational vehicle market, which remains well below pre-recession industry sales levels. The company's fiscal 2011 outlook includes the following assumptions: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 15 to 20 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales increasing 5 to 10 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories declining 20 to 30 percent; improving gross margins between 200 to 300 basis points; achieving flat to slightly down operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet.
 
Based on its year-to-date results and expectations of future performance, Arctic Cat is raising and narrowing its estimated full-year earnings for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2011. The company now anticipates that fiscal 2011 earnings will be in the range of $0.57 to $0.65 per diluted share, driven by increased international revenue, as well as higher gross margins resulting from higher volume, product mix and cost reduction efforts. The company's previous guidance anticipated fiscal 2011 earnings of $0.40 to $0.55 per diluted share. The company continues to estimate fiscal 2011 net sales of $453 million to $463 million.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, May 12, 2011  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported that net earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, increased to $13.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, up from prior-year net earnings of $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Arctic Cat's net sales for the fiscal 2011 full year grew to $464.7 million versus $450.7 million last fiscal year.
Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer, commented: "We are pleased with the continued improvement in Arctic Cat's full-year profitability and revenue. Contributing to our fiscal 2011 results were increased sales of snowmobiles and snow-related parts, garments and accessories. Our ongoing emphasis on controlling our cost structure led to higher gross margins and operating profits in fiscal 2011, while additional inventory reductions further strengthened the company's balance sheet."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2011 full-year financial results versus last fiscal year:
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 2011 fourth quarter ended March 31, 2011, Arctic Cat reported a net loss of $9.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, on net sales of $73.5 million. Arctic Cat reported a net loss in the prior-year fourth quarter of $9.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, on net sales of $84.0 million. Due to the seasonality of Arctic Cat's business, the company typically reports lower results in its fiscal first and fourth quarters, and its fiscal second and third quarters are historically its strongest.

Business Line Results
Arctic Cat's fourth-quarter snowmobile sales were a negative $4.5 million, primarily due to sales incentives, versus sales of $597,000 in the prior-year quarter. Full-year snowmobile sales grew 12 percent to $182.0 million compared to $162.9 million last year, due to strong U.S. and international snowmobile sales.
"In fiscal 2011, we were pleased to see snowmobile sales rebound from their recessionary levels a year ago," said Jordan. "In March, we unveiled 23 exciting, all-new snowmobiles, representing 75 percent of our 2012 model year line-up, which we believe will have a positive impact on fiscal 2012 snowmobile sales. We remain firmly focused on being a technology innovation leader. Our latest first-to-market technologies will further enhance sled performance and rider comfort."
In addition to offering the world's fastest snowmobiles, Arctic Cat's newly introduced 2012 models are equipped with an exclusive new chassis, suspension, and drive and braking technologies.
Arctic Cat's ATV sales totaled $48.0 million in the fourth quarter versus $55.8 million in the prior-year quarter, as the business continued to focus on lowering dealer inventory. Full-year ATV sales declined 4 percent in fiscal 2011 to $181.1 million compared to $188.0 million in fiscal 2010.
"Industry-wide ATV retail sales continued to decline in fiscal 2011, however, we gained traction with three new ATV products that were introduced in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter. These included two value-priced models  the full-featured 350 4x4 automatic and the 425 EFI 4x4 automatic  as well as a new crossover XC450i ATV. These new products, combined with our existing strong line-up, allowed us to take market share in fiscal 2011," said Jordan. "We also are excited to soon enter the growing sport side-by-side segment with our new Wildcat sport side-by-side model. Although we haven't yet disclosed specific details on this product, we recently previewed the Wildcat at our snow dealer show and plan to begin shipping this off-road vehicle to dealers during fiscal 2012."
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter rose 9 percent to $29.9 million versus $27.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The growth in PG&A was due primarily to a strong snow season in North America that resulted in higher sales of snow-related parts, garments and accessories. For fiscal 2011, PG&A sales totaled $101.6 million compared to $99.9 million in the prior year.
Outlook
"We remain pleased with our progress to further improve Arctic Cat's profitability and sales in fiscal 2011, and we expect to make continued gains in fiscal 2012," Jordan said. "Our successful efforts to reduce dealer inventories leave Arctic Cat well-positioned for future sales growth, assuming the economy continues its current rate of improvement. We also remain focused on leveraging the company's operational efficiencies, in order to further enhance profitability."
Arctic Cat Reports Fiscal 2011 Results  3
 
The company's fiscal 2012 outlook includes the following assumptions: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 10 to 15 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales up approximately 5 to 10 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories declining 10 to 20 percent; achieving flat operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet. At this time, the company expects gross margins to improve between 20 to 60 basis points in fiscal 2012, although commodity costs will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, Arctic Cat anticipates sales in the range of $488 million to $502 million, an increase of 5 percent to 8 percent versus fiscal 2011. The company estimates that fiscal 2012 earnings will increase 7 percent to 17 percent and be in the range of $0.75 to $0.82 per diluted share.
"We are confident that our strategies will enable Arctic Cat to deliver improved shareholder value again this fiscal year," said Jordan.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 28, 2011  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported that net sales increased 18 percent to $74.9 million in the fiscal 2012 first quarter ended June 30, 2011, up from net sales of $63.4 million in the prior-year first quarter. The company's first quarter net loss improved to $2.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. Arctic Cat historically reports a net loss in its fiscal first quarter, due to the seasonal nature of its products; the majority of the company's sales and earnings occur in its fiscal second and third quarters.
Commented Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer: "We are very pleased with Arctic Cat's double-digit sales gains and improved profitability in the 2012 first quarter. Revenue grew across all product lines, with particularly strong sales of our Prowler side-by-side utility vehicles contributing to the quarter's results. We continued to focus on our strategies to increase sales by offering innovative products featuring first-to-market technologies, and to improve profitability through a continued emphasis on operational excellence and a lower cost structure."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's 2012 first quarter financial results versus the same quarter last year:

In the first quarter, Arctic Cat unveiled a partial lineup of its 2012 ATVs and side-by-sides. New models include the MudPro 700i LTD, with electronic power steering, and the Prowler 700i HDX, which received a sporty, new round tube surround frame for 2012. The three-passenger Prowler HDX is designed to be a heavy-duty utility workhorse. Its versatile rear cargo box hauls up to 1,000 lbs. and offers removable sides to create a convenient flatbed. In addition, power steering and an extra long wheelbase give it a smooth, comfortable ride. Arctic Cat also added enhanced features throughout its extensive ATV and side-by-side Prowler line-up.
"Sales of our ATVs outperformed the industry in the first quarter and we gained market share," said Jordan. "We are excited to launch our first entry into the growing sport side-by-side market with our Wildcat model, and we remain on track to ship this off-road vehicle to dealers in fiscal 2012. Looking ahead, we expect continued growth in fiscal 2012 in our ATV segment, due to the competitive strength of our core ATV and Prowler offerings, and the growth potential for the Wildcat sport side-by-side model."
On July 27, 2011, Arctic Cat unveiled the all-new Wildcat V-Twin 1000i H.O. as the most potent pure-sport recreational off-road vehicle (ROV) ever built. With 17 inches of suspension travel, 13 inches of ground clearance, a full-perimeter frame and the largest displacement engine in its class, the Wildcat is a full-production version of what was previously reserved for off-road race vehicles. In addition to industry-leading suspension travel, standard features on the Wildcat include power steering, and front and rear LED lights.
"The Wildcat has no equalperiod," said Jordan. "Our customers asked for a high-performance side-by-side and we happily responded with a no-compromise, pure-sport hot rod that redefines what's possible with a production off-road vehicle."
Snowmobile sales rose 2 percent to $17.4 million in the first quarter compared to $17.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Arctic Cat unveiled an extensive new 2012 model line-up in March, with 23 all-new snowmobiles representing 75 percent of the current offerings. The company anticipates that the breadth of its new models and innovative technologies will have a positive impact on fiscal 2012 snowmobile sales.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the first quarter grew 7 percent to $19.7 million versus $18.5 million in the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, Arctic Cat launched a PG&A e-commerce website for the U.S. market, giving consumers a convenient online shopping option for the full range of Arctic Cat PG&A products. Arctic Cat continues to expand its new accessories and garment offerings.

Company Raises Fiscal 2012 Outlook
"We are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2012 and are optimistic about the year ahead, as we celebrate the 50
th
anniversary of the Arctic Cat brand," Jordan said. "Based on the higher than anticipated sales and earnings in the first quarter, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2012. The company is well-positioned for future sales growth across our product lines. We expect significantly higher snowmobile sales, due to our new model line-up. In addition, we are excited about the upcoming launch of our Wildcat sport side-by-side model, coupled with the strength of our core ATV and Prowler offerings. Further, we remain focused on enhancing profitability by continuing to leverage the company's operational efficiencies."
The company's fiscal 2012 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 10 to 15 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales up approximately 5 to 10 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories decreasing 10 to 20 percent; achieving flat to slightly down operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more cash on the balance sheet. At this time, the company expects gross margins to improve between 20 to 60 basis points in fiscal 2012, although commodity costs will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, Arctic Cat now anticipates sales in the range of $520 million to $530 million, an increase of 12 percent to 14 percent versus fiscal 2011. The company estimates that fiscal 2012 earnings will increase 34 percent to 43 percent and be in the range of $0.94 to $1.00 per diluted share. Previously, the company expected sales in the range of $488 million to $502 million for fiscal 2012 and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.75 to $0.82 per diluted share.
"We are confident that our strategies will enable Arctic Cat to deliver improved shareholder value again this fiscal year," said Jordan.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, December 28, 2011  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today announced that it has purchased all of Suzuki Motor Corporation's approximately 6.1 million shares of Arctic Cat Class B common stock for a purchase price of $79.3 million. The stock buyback reduces Arctic Cat's outstanding shares from 18.4 million to 12.3 million, increasing non-Suzuki shareholders' ownership of outstanding common shares by approximately 33 percent, and leaves Arctic Cat's public share float unchanged. Arctic Cat funded this purchase with existing cash on its balance sheet. The company expects to end its 2012 fiscal year with more than $60 million in cash and no debt, after deducting cash used for the share purchase from Suzuki.
Commented Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer: "Based on our current cash position and ongoing cash generation, we feel comfortable with this share purchase and believe it provides great value to our remaining shareholders. Suzuki has been a major shareholder since 1988 and a valued engine supplier for the Arctic Cat brand since 1976. We have benefited significantly from this long-standing relationship. Although Suzuki will no longer have an ownership stake in Arctic Cat, we look forward to continuing to purchase snowmobile engines for the next two model years, in addition to having Suzuki supply Arctic Cat with snowmobile engine parts to service existing engines after that time."
As previously announced on June 10, 2010, Suzuki will supply snowmobile engines to Arctic Cat through the 2014 model year, as well as engine parts to service existing engines. Arctic Cat will move snowmobile engine manufacturing to its St. Cloud, Minn., facility, where the company has manufactured ATV engines since 2007.
In conjunction with the buyback of all of Suzuki's Class B Arctic Cat shares, Suzuki's representative has resigned from Arctic Cat's board of directors, effective immediately. This is a position granted Suzuki as part of its ownership of the Class B shares, does not continue following the buyback and brings the total number on Arctic Cat's board to seven, the majority of which are independent directors.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, January 26, 2012  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported net earnings of $17.0 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, on net sales of $207.0 million for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2011. In the prior-year third quarter, Arctic Cat reported net earnings of $9.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, on net sales of $152.0 million.
"We are very pleased with the company's strong third-quarter and year-to-date performance. Arctic Cat continued to execute well during the quarter, producing double-digit sales and earnings gains," said Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer. "Our focus on introducing innovative products and technologies, such as our extensive new snowmobile line-up and the Wildcat sport side-by-side, contributed to the strong third-quarter results and helped generate increased sales across all product lines."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2012 third quarter financial results versus the same quarter last year:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross margins in the fiscal 2012 third quarter rose 154 basis points, primarily due to higher volumes, selling prices and improved product mix, coupled with lower sales incentives. The company continues to expect full-year gross margin improvement of 20 to 60 basis points.
Total cash and short-term investments at quarter end were $76.3 million compared to $107.1 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Arctic Cat used $79.3 million in cash during the fiscal 2012 third quarter to purchase all of Suzuki Motor Corporation's 6.1 million shares of Arctic Cat Class B common stock. The
Arctic Cat Reports Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Results  2
 
stock buyback was funded entirely with existing cash on the company's balance sheet. The transaction reduced Arctic Cat's outstanding shares from 18.4 million to 12.3 million, increasing non-Suzuki shareholders' ownership of outstanding common shares by approximately 33 percent while leaving Arctic Cat's public share float unchanged.
Commented Jordan: "We believe that this stock buyback provides immediate and long-term value to our remaining shareholders, who should see the benefit in improved earnings per diluted share from reduced shares over the next four quarters."
Following the share purchase from Suzuki, Arctic Cat continues to have a strong balance sheet. Given the company's current cash position and projected cash generation, Arctic Cat expects to end the current 2012 fiscal year with more than $60 million in cash.
As previously announced, Suzuki will continue to supply snowmobile engines to Arctic Cat through the 2014 model year, as well as engine parts to service existing engines. Arctic Cat will move snowmobile engine manufacturing to its St. Cloud, Minn., facility, where the company has manufactured ATV engines since 2007.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, Arctic Cat's net earnings increased to $36.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, on net sales of $486.8 million. In the first nine months of last fiscal year, the company reported net earnings of $22.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, on net sales of $391.2 million.
Business Line Results
Snowmobile sales rose 61 percent to $125.2 million in the fiscal 2012 third quarter, up from $77.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Sales continued to be fueled by Arctic Cat's extensive new 2012 model line-up, announced in March 2011, with 23 all-new snowmobiles representing 75 percent of the current offerings.
ATV sales increased 12 percent to $54.4 million in the fiscal 2012 third quarter versus $48.6 million in the same period last year, with strong contributions from Arctic Cat's Prowler line of side-by-sides. During the third quarter, Arctic Cat began shipping limited quantities of its all-new Wildcat V-Twin 1000i H.O. sport recreational off-road vehicle (ROV) to dealers. The Wildcat ROV was introduced to the public through demonstrations and rides held throughout North America. Arctic Cat is ramping up production of the Wildcat in the fiscal fourth quarter in order to meet demand for this off-road sport vehicle.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2012 third quarter grew 7 percent to $27.4 million versus $25.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The growth was primarily due to snowmobile-related parts, garments and accessories sales. With the launch of its e-commerce site in Canada, Arctic Cat now offers online PG&A sales throughout North America. The company also launched a wide range of accessories for Wildcat vehicle customization.

Company Raises Fiscal 2012 Outlook
"With product innovation driving increased sales and our continued progress on operational excellence and execution, we are raising our fiscal 2012 sales and earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter," said Jordan. "We remain well-positioned for future sales growth across all product lines."
Arctic Cat continues to expect higher snowmobile retail sales in fiscal 2012, due to its new model line-up. The company also anticipates continued gains in its ROV business, fueled by the competitive strength of the Prowler side-by-side offerings and the growth potential for the Wildcat pure-sport ROV model. Additionally, the company remains focused on further enhancing profitability through operational efficiencies.
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2012 outlook now includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: ATV industry retail sales declining approximately 10 to 15 percent; snowmobile industry retail sales up approximately 3 to 5 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories decreasing 10 to 20 percent; achieving lower operating expense levels as a percent of sales; increasing cash flow from operations; and ending the year with more than $60 million in cash on its balance sheet and no debt. The company expects gross margins to improve between 20 to 60 basis points in fiscal 2012.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, Arctic Cat now anticipates sales in the range of $568 million to $575 million, an increase of 22 percent to 24 percent versus fiscal 2011. The company estimates that fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70, an increase of 129 percent to 143 percent. Previously, the company expected fiscal 2012 sales in the range of $530 million to $545 million and earnings in the range of $1.10 to $1.15 per diluted share.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, May 15, 2012(BUSINESS WIRE) Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ:ACATNews) today reported net earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, rose 130 percent to $29.9 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, up from prior-year net earnings of $13.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. Arctic Cat's net sales for the fiscal 2012 full year grew 26 percent to $585.3 million versus net sales of $464.7 million last fiscal year.
"We are very pleased with the company's continued strong sales and earnings performance in fiscal 2012," said Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer. "Sales rose across all product lines for the full year. Double-digit gains in our snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle segments were fueled by the introduction of innovative products and technologies, such as our extensive new snowmobile line-up and the Wildcat sport side-by-side. Higher sales volumes, coupled with our focus on operational excellence and cost control, led to another year of outstanding financial results."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2012 full-year financial results versus last fiscal year:
 
 
 
 
 
For the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter ended March 31, 2012, Arctic Cat reported an improved net loss of $6.2 million, or a loss of $0.49 per diluted share, on 34 percent net sales growth to $98.5 million. In the prior-year fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported a net loss of $9.6 million, or a loss of $0.52 per diluted share, on net sales of $73.5 million. Due to the seasonality of Arctic Cat's business, the company typically reports lower results in its fiscal first and fourth quarters, while its fiscal second and third quarters are historically its strongest.
Business Line Results
"Snowmobile sales in fiscal 2012 benefitted from the tremendous enthusiasm generated by the largest introduction of new models in Arctic Cat's history," said Jordan. Arctic Cat had five of the top 10-selling snowmobile models for the 2012 model year. In addition, two of Arctic Cat's 2012 sleds were named snowmobile of the year  the XF1100 Turbo Sno Pro and the F1100 Turbo Sno Pro.
In the 2012 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales were a negative $6.8 million, primarily due to sales incentives, versus negative sales of $4.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Full-year snowmobile sales rose 38 percent to $250.4 million compared to $182.0 million last fiscal year. Sales for the full year were driven by Arctic Cat's extensive new 2012 model line-up, with 23 all-new snowmobiles representing 75 percent of the company's offerings. In addition to producing the world's fastest snowmobiles, Arctic Cat's 2012 models featured two new chassis  the ProCross performance and ProClimb mountain platforms  as well as new suspension, drive and braking technologies.
Added Jordan, "We are continuing to build on our new chassis platforms with exciting new sleds for the 2013 model year. Looking ahead, we also remain committed to investing in research and development, in order to remain an industry innovation leader and in anticipation of manufacturing our own snowmobile engines."
Among the new 2013 model year snowmobiles introduced to dealers in March 2012 are the ProCross F Sno Pro RR (race replica) sled that features high-performance trail racing suspension and styling. Also new is the Procross XF CrossTour, a crossover model that combines the best of snowmobile touring, trail and deep-snow capabilities. The CrossTour, available in either the 800 2-stroke or the 1100 turbo and non-turbo 4-stroke engine, offers riders trail performance and touring comfort with its wide ski stance, ample storage and a heavy-duty rear bumper that easily accepts accessories, such as an optional passenger seat. Arctic Cat's ProClimb M Series mountain snowmobiles also received further enhancements to performance and handling. The turbocharged M1100 four-stroke mountain model, with 177 horsepower, remains the industry's most powerful production engine available to date.
As previously announced, Suzuki is supplying snowmobile engines to Arctic Cat through the 2014 model year, as well as engine parts to service existing engines beyond that time. Beginning with the 2015 model year, Arctic Cat will manufacture its own snowmobile engines at its St. Cloud, Minn., facility, where the company has produced ATV engines since 2007.
In the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat's ATV sales increased 58 percent to $75.8 million versus $48.0 million in the same period last year, chiefly due to strong dealer demand for the all-new Wildcat V-Twin 1000i H.O. sport recreational off-road vehicle (ROV). Full-year ATV sales rose 25 percent to $226.9 million driven by both Wildcat and international sales.
"We remain very pleased with the strong demand for our new Wildcat off-road sport vehicle," commented Jordan. "We believe this segment presents a great growth opportunity."
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter were nearly flat at $29.5 million versus $29.9 million in the prior-year quarter. For the 2012 full-year, PG&A sales grew 6 percent to $107.9 million compared to $101.6 million last fiscal year. The growth was primarily due to accessories sales for ATVs/Wildcat and snowmobiles, as well as ATV parts and garments.
Company Issues Fiscal 2013 Outlook
In fiscal 2013, Arctic Cat anticipates continued gains in its ATV/ROV business, fueled by the growth potential for the Wildcat pure-sport ROV model and Prowler side-by-side offerings. Additionally, the company remains focused on further enhancing profitability through operational efficiencies.
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: core ATV North America industry retail sales flat to down 5 percent; snowmobile North America industry retail sales flat to up 2 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories flat to down 5 percent; achieving flat operating expense levels as a percent of sales; and increasing cash flow from operations. The company expects gross margins to improve between 20 and 60 basis points in fiscal 2013.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, Arctic Cat anticipates sales in the range of $631 million to $650 million, an increase of approximately 8 percent to 11 percent versus fiscal 2012. Assuming diluted weighted average shares of 14 million, the company estimates that fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50, an increase of 40 percent to 45 percent compared to fiscal 2012.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 26, 2012  Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported the company swung to net earnings of $2.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, 2012, up from a prior-year net loss of $2.3 million, or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share. Arctic Cat's net sales for the fiscal 2013 first quarter grew 49 percent to $111.3 million versus net sales of $74.9 million in the same quarter last year.
"We are very pleased to start our new fiscal year with another quarter of outstanding sales and earnings," said Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's president and chief executive officer. "Sales rose across all product lines in the first quarter, led by strong contributions from our new Wildcat pure sport and Prowler side-by-side vehicles, and core ATVs. We continued to leverage higher sales volumes and a lower cost structure to deliver improved profitability in the first quarter."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 first-quarter financial results versus the prior-year quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
Business Line Results
Sales in Arctic Cat's all-terrain vehicle (ATV) business rose 93 percent to $73.0 million, up from $37.9 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to strong dealer and customer demand for the all-new Wildcat V-Twin 1000i H.O. pure-sport ROV, as well as Prowler side-by-side utility vehicles and core ATVs.
Arctic Cat Reports Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Results  2
Commented Jordan: "Wildcat sales are on track to meet our high expectations this fiscal year for the growing ROV market. In addition, with the further reductions achieved in our ATV/ROV inventory in fiscal 2012, dealer inventory is now near optimum levels and we are starting to see increased demand from our dealers."
In August 2012, Arctic Cat will begin shipping new model year 2013 ATVs/ROVs, including five ATV models and a new limited edition Wildcat 1000 ROV. The new limited Wildcat will offer upgraded styling features, as part of a standard package.
Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales in the fiscal 2013 first quarter rose 4 percent to $18.0 million, up from $17.4 million in the prior-year quarter. For the 2013 model year, the company is building snowmobiles on its new ProCross performance and ProClimb mountain chassis platforms, introduced in fiscal 2012, and will continue offering innovative suspension, drive and braking technologies. Arctic Cat is committed to investing in research and development, in order to remain an industry innovation leader and in anticipation of manufacturing its own snowmobile engines in fiscal 2015.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2013 first quarter increased 3 percent to $20.4 million versus $19.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Contributing to the growth were accessory sales for the Wildcat ROV. Arctic Cat's growing line of Wildcat accessories now includes 43 wide-ranging options for riding enjoyment and vehicle customization. Among the top-selling Wildcat accessories are front and rear bumpers, flip up windshields, skid plates and winches.
Company Raises Fiscal 2013 Sales and Earnings Outlook
"We are bullish about our future," said Jordan. "We expect to generate further revenue and earnings growth by continuing our product development focus and entering new segments that we're not in today. Our goal for fiscal 2013 is to deliver the highest net earnings in Arctic Cat's 50-year history."
In fiscal 2013, Arctic Cat anticipates continued gains in its ATV/ROV business, fueled by the growth potential for the Wildcat and Prowler ROV offerings, and many exciting new products being developed. Additionally, the company remains focused on further enhancing profitability through operational efficiencies and a continued focus on cost controls.
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: ATV North America industry retail sales flat to up 5 percent; ROV North America industry retail sales up 10 to 20 percent; snowmobile North America industry retail sales flat to up 2 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories flat to down 5 percent; operating expense levels that are flat to down slightly as a percent of sales; and increasing cash flow from operations.

Sales in Arctic Cat's all-terrain vehicle (ATV) business rose 19 percent to $69.7 million, up from $58.8 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to strong global demand from dealers and customers for the Wildcat side-by-side.
During the fiscal 2013 second quarter, Arctic Cat began shipping its new 2013 model year ATVs/ROVs. In addition to offering the Wildcat V-Twin 1000i H.O., the company introduced the new Wildcat 1000 Limited side-by-side, which offers upgraded styling features as part of a standard package. Arctic Cat's new 2013 models also include five value-priced ATVs, such as the new 500 Core ATV. Additionally, the company introduced three new ATV packages  Limited, XT and CORE  to provide more optional features.
Commented Jordan: "Our entry into the growing sport ROV segment has gone exceptionally well with the Wildcat side-by-side. It is being well-received by enthusiasts and Wildcat sales year to date continue to meet our high expectations. We now have two Wildcat offerings in our portfolio and anticipate launching additional innovative products into this market segment."
Jordan added: "In August, we were excited to see the Wildcat 1000 named as the top pure sport ROV by a leading industry magazine, after the editors conducted a head-to-head shootout' comparison against the only competing pure sport side-by-side in the market."
Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales in the fiscal 2013 second quarter rose 12 percent to $128.6 million, up from $114.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The company's new 2013 model year snowmobiles have received numerous industry awards, including: Editor's Choice for the F1100 Turbo RR (race-replica); Best High Performance for the F800 Sno Pro RR; and Best Crossover for the CrossTour 1100 Turbo.
Arctic Cat is building its 2013 model year snowmobiles on the new ProCross performance and ProClimb mountain chassis platforms, both of which offer innovative suspension, drive and braking technologies. In addition, during the fiscal 2013 second quarter, the company partnered with world champion snowmobile racer Tucker Hibbert to create a limited edition Tucker Hibbert race-replica model honed to high performance excellence and available to snowmobilers whose passion reflects the same race-winning attitude shared by Tucker Hibbert and Arctic Cat.
Arctic Cat's new 2013 model year snowmobiles also include:

Arctic Cat remains committed to investing in research and development across its product lines, in order to remain an industry innovation leader and in anticipation of manufacturing its own snowmobile engines in fiscal 2015.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2013 second quarter were down 2 percent to $30.8 million versus $31.4 million in the prior-year quarter. While sales of Wildcat accessories and parts grew significantly in the quarter, snowmobile garment sales were down versus the prior-year period. Arctic Cat continues to anticipate increased PG&A sales for the fiscal 2013 full year.
Company Raises Fiscal 2013 Sales and Earnings Outlook
"Our strategies are working and we are on track to deliver the highest net earnings in Arctic Cat's 50-year history for fiscal 2013," said Jordan. "We expect to continue generating higher revenue and earnings by developing innovative new products and entering new segments. We remain focused on new product development as an important catalyst to achieving our future growth goals."
In fiscal 2013, Arctic Cat anticipates continued gains in its ATV/ROV business, fueled by the growth potential for the Wildcat and Prowler ROV offerings, and many exciting new products being developed. Additionally, the company remains focused on further enhancing profitability through operational efficiencies and cost controls.
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: ATV North America industry retail sales flat to up 5 percent; ROV North America industry retail sales up 10 to 20 percent; snowmobile North America industry retail sales flat to up 2 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories flat to down 5 percent; operating expense levels that are flat to down slightly as a percent of sales; and increasing cash flow from operations. The company expects gross margins to improve between 20 and 60 basis points in fiscal 2013.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, Arctic Cat is raising its full-year sales guidance to a range of $664 million to $684 million, an increase of approximately 13 percent to 17 percent versus

fiscal 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial Release
ARCTIC CAT REPORTS RECORD EPS IN FISCAL 2013 THIRD QUARTER
Quarterly EPS increased 41 percent to record $1.30 versus $0.92 in prior-year quarter;
Net sales up 5 percent in quarter to $218.0 million on strong North American ATV/side-by-side sales;
Company reports record year-to-date net earnings and earnings per diluted share;
Raising full-year earnings outlook for fiscal 2013
MINNEAPOLIS(BUSINESS WIRE)Jan. 24, 2013 Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ:ACAT) today reported record earnings per diluted share of $1.30 on net earnings of $17.9 million for the fiscal 2013 third quarter ended December 31, 2012, compared to prior-year earnings per diluted share of $0.92 on net earnings of $17.0 million. Net sales in the fiscal 2013 third quarter increased 5 percent to $218.0 million versus net sales of $207.0 million in the same quarter last year.
"We are very pleased to report record earnings per share and increased sales in our third quarter, compared to a strong prior-year quarter of double-digit sales and earnings gains," said Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer. "The company's results are in line with our expectations for continued top- and bottom-line growth. During the fiscal third quarter, we made further progress on our growth strategy to enter new market segments by introducing two new Wildcat pure sport side-by-sides that will begin shipping during the fiscal fourth quarter. These included our first four-seat Wildcat model and a high-performance, 90-plus horsepower Wildcat 1000 X model. We now have four models in our Wildcat line, all of which we launched in the past 13 months."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 third quarter financial results versus the prior-year quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the nine months ended December 31, 2012, Arctic Cat reported the highest net earnings and earnings per diluted share in the company's history. Year-to-date earnings per diluted share rose 68 percent to a record $3.25 on record net earnings of $44.8 million, compared to prior-year earnings per diluted share of $1.94 on net earnings of $36.1 million. The company's year-to-date net sales increased 15 percent to $558.4 million versus net sales of $486.8 million in the first nine months last year.
Business Line Results
Sales in Arctic Cat's all-terrain vehicle (ATV)/side-by-side business rose 28 percent to $69.6 million, up from $54.4 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to strong global demand from dealers and distributors for the Wildcat side-by-side. Year-to-date ATV/side-by-side sales grew 40 percent to $212.2 million compared to $151.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012.
"Sales of Wildcat side-by-sides met our high expectations for the third quarter and year to date," said Jordan. "We remain pleased with consumer and dealer enthusiasm for the Wildcat, and anticipate growing revenue contributions from our expanding Wildcat line."
Arctic Cat's ATV/side-by-side business rose to 38 percent of consolidated sales year-to-date, up from 31 percent of consolidated sales in the same period last year. "As part of our overall growth strategy, we are focused on further increasing our ATV/side-by-side business as a percent of Arctic Cat's total sales going forward, driven by innovative product launches in this market segment," said Jordan. "We continued to advance this goal with our recent launch of two new Wildcat models. In addition, we have a robust new product pipeline for future growth."
Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales in the fiscal 2013 third quarter were down 2 percent to $122.4 million from $125.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date snowmobile sales increased 5 percent to $269.0 million, up from $257.3 million in the same period last year, led by growth in Canada and other international markets."
Commented Jordan: "We anticipated that this would be a tough quarterly comparison for our snowmobile sales, as we are up against strong snowmobile sales in the year-ago quarter. Last year, we unveiled the largest new snowmobile introduction in the company's history, with 23 all-new models representing 75 percent of our offerings."
Arctic Cat's new 2013 model year snowmobiles have received industry awards as the Best High Performance for the F800 Sno Pro RR (race-replica) and Best Crossover for the CrossTour 1100 Turbo. The company's 2013 model year snowmobiles are built on its new ProCross performance and ProClimb mountain chassis platforms, both of which offer innovative suspension, drive and braking technologies.
Arctic Cat is committed to investing in research and development across its product lines, in order to remain an industry innovation leader and in anticipation of manufacturing its own snowmobile engines.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2013 third quarter were down 5 percent to $26.0 million versus $27.4 million in the prior-year quarter. An increase in Wildcat parts and accessories sales in the fiscal 2013 third quarter was not sufficient to offset a decline in snowmobile garment sales, due to lower than expected early season snowfall. Year-to-date PG&A sales totaled $77.1 million, down 2 percent from $78.4 million in the year-ago period. For the fiscal 2013 full year, Arctic Cat continues to anticipate increased PG&A sales of 1 percent to 3 percent.
Company Raises Fiscal 2013 Earnings Outlook
"We remain on track to deliver the highest net earnings in Arctic Cat's 50-year history for the fiscal 2013 full year," said Jordan. "We expect to continue generating higher revenue and earnings by developing innovative new products and entering new market segments. Our strategies are working and we are raising our full-year earnings guidance."
In fiscal 2013, Arctic Cat anticipates continued gains in its ATV/side-by-side business, fueled by the growth potential for the Wildcat and Prowler side-by-side offerings, and many exciting new products being developed. Additionally, the company remains focused on further enhancing profitability through operational efficiencies and cost controls.
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: ATV North America industry retail sales flat to up 5 percent; side-by-side North America industry retail sales up 10 to 20 percent; snowmobile North America industry retail sales down 2 percent to up 2 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories flat to up 5 percent; operating expense levels that are down slightly as a percent of sales; and increasing cash flow from operations. The company expects gross margins to improve between 20 and 60 basis points in fiscal 2013.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, Arctic Cat now estimates that fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, an increase of 60 percent to 66 percent compared to fiscal 2012. Previously, the company estimated fiscal 2013 earnings of $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share. The company continues to anticipate sales for the full 2013 fiscal year in the range of $664 million to $684 million, an increase of approximately 13 percent to 17 percent versus fiscal 2012.
Board Additions
Arctic Cat added two new members to its board of directors in the fiscal 2013 third quarter. Joe Puishys is president and CEO of Apogee Enterprises and Stan Askren is chairman and CEO of HNI Corporation. Arctic Cat now has eight members on its board of directors, the majority of whom are independent.
"We look forward to benefiting from their insights, as we pursue continued growth and enhanced operational efficiency," said Jordan.

Financial Release
ARCTIC CAT REPORTS FISCAL 2013 RESULTS
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS(BUSINESS WIRE)May. 15, 2013 Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today reported record net earnings and earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. Net earnings rose 33 percent to $39.7 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, up from prior-year net earnings of $29.9 million, or $1.72 per diluted share. Arctic Cat's net sales for the fiscal 2013 full year increased 15 percent to $671.6 million versus $585.3 million last fiscal year.
"We had another year of outstanding financial performance and are very pleased to report record net earnings and EPS for the fiscal 2013 full year," said Claude Jordan, Arctic Cat's chairman and chief executive officer. "Higher sales volumes, combined with our ongoing focus on operational excellence and cost control, again contributed to strong top- and bottom-line results for fiscal 2013."
Among the highlights of Arctic Cat's fiscal 2013 full-year financial results versus last fiscal year:
 
 
 
 
 
 
As expected, for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported an improved net loss of $5.1 million, or a loss of $0.38 per diluted share, on 15 percent net sales growth to $113.2 million. In the prior-year fourth quarter, Arctic Cat reported a net loss of $6.2 million, or a loss of $0.49 per diluted share, on net sales of $98.5 million. Due to the seasonality of Arctic Cat's business, the company typically reports lower results in its fiscal first and fourth quarters, while the fiscal second and third quarters are historically its strongest.
Commenting on the 2013 fourth quarter, Jordan said: "Our business performed well in the quarter, with sales increasing across all product lines. We continued to pursue our strategy to enter new growth segments and launch innovative new products, including two all-new Wildcat sport side-by-sides. As a result, we again had double-digit sales gains in our ATV and side-by-side segments in the 2013 fourth quarter."
Based on the strength of the company's performance, strong cash flow and future prospects, Arctic Cat's board of directors has authorized the reinstatement of a quarterly cash dividend and a $30 million share repurchase program, which were announced separately today. "We are committed to enhancing shareholder value, and are pleased to reinstate a quarterly dividend and announce a new stock buyback program," commented Jordan.
Business Line Results
 Arctic Cat's ATV/side-by-side sales increased 16 percent to $87.6 million in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, up from $75.8 million in the same period last year, chiefly due to strong dealer demand for Wildcat side-by-sides and North American ATVs and Prowlers. Full-year ATV/side-by-side sales rose 32 percent to $299.8 million, driven by ATV, Prowler and Wildcat sales.
ATVs and Side-by-Sides
"We remain focused on further increasing our ATV/side-by-side business as a percent of Arctic Cat's total sales going forward," said Jordan. "In the fourth quarter, we continued to advance this goal with the launch of two new Wildcat models. In addition, we have a robust new product pipeline for future growth."
In the 2013 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat introduced two all-new Wildcats that both include industry leading rear travel of 18 inches and 13 inches of ground clearance:
 
 
In addition to the Wildcat 4 and the Wildcat X, Arctic Cat announced a new 50-inch wide, trail-legal Wildcat that will begin shipping in the latter part of fiscal 2014. Its narrower stance allows riders access to authorized ATV trails, making it a versatile option for consumers. The Wildcat trail-legal version builds on the success of the pure-sport Wildcat, which was recognized as the "Best-In-Class Extreme Performance ROV" by a prominent industry magazine.
The Wildcat is now available in: Base and Limited models; the four-seat Wildcat 4; and the high-horsepower Wildcat X.
In the 2013 fourth quarter, Arctic Cat's snowmobile sales improved to a negative $5.3 million, primarily due to sales incentives, versus negative sales of $6.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Full-year snowmobile sales increased 5 percent to $263.7 million compared to $250.4 million last fiscal year.
Snowmobiles 
As part of Arctic Cat's snowmobile growth strategy, the company announced in February 2013 expanded engine supply and co-brand agreements with Yamaha Motor Corporation, beginning with the 2014 model year. The agreement gives Arctic Cat customers a broader range of snowmobile engine choices, including access to select 4-stroke engines from Yamaha. In addition, Arctic Cat will build select Yamaha snowmobiles in Arctic Cat's Thief River Falls, Minn., factory according to Yamaha's specifications.
In the quarter, Arctic Cat unveiled its new 2014 snowmobile model line-up, featuring 10 new models, including the all-new ZR 6000 El Tigre high-performance sled. The company also introduced two new available engines: a Yamaha 4-stroke 135 horse-power engine; and a clean 600cc 2-stroke 125 horse-power engine. The 600cc engine will be the first Arctic Cat-designed and built snowmobile engine and will be manufactured in the company's engine facility in St. Cloud, Minn., beginning with the 2014 model year.
Sales of parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter increased 5 percent to $31.0 million versus $29.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The growth was primarily due to snowmobile parts sales, reflecting improved snow conditions experienced in the northern United States. For the 2013 full year, PG&A sales were essentially flat, although Arctic Cat had significant year-over-year improvements in Wildcat parts and accessories.

"We anticipate another year of increased sales and earnings in fiscal 2014, fueled by a strong pipeline of innovative new products and technologies, further market share gains in the growing side-by-side segment and continued leverage in our cost structure," said Jordan. "We are excited about our future prospects and confident in our ability to deliver another year of enhanced shareholder value and record earnings."
Arctic Cat's fiscal 2014 outlook includes the following assumptions versus the prior fiscal year: core ATV North America industry retail sales flat to up 5 percent; side-by-side North American industry retail sales up 15 percent to 25 percent; snowmobile North America industry retail sales flat to up 3 percent; Arctic Cat dealer inventories excluding new products flat to up 10 percent; achieving slightly lower operating expense levels as a percent of sales; and increasing cash flow from operations. The company expects gross margins to decrease by approximately 80 basis points, due to additional Yamaha snowmobiles that will be built in Arctic Cat's factory and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian currency impact.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014, Arctic Cat anticipates sales in the range of $754 million to $768 million, an increase of approximately 12 percent to 14 percent versus fiscal 2013. Assuming diluted weighted average shares in the range of 13.5 million to 13.8 million, the company estimates that fiscal 2014 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $3.17 to $3.27, an increase of 10 percent to 13 percent compared to fiscal 2013.
