ITEM 9.    REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
The information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-8216.
 
On April 16, 2003, AptarGroup, Inc. announced its results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The press release regarding this announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Crystal Lake, Illinois, April 16, 2003  AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter results.
 
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, sales increased 21 percent to $265.1 million from $218.7 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 9 percent from the prior year. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 increased to a record $19.2 million from $13.3 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.53 per share compared to $.36 per share in the prior year.
 
In the first quarter of the prior year, the Company recorded after-tax charges totaling $2.8 million related to a patent dispute settlement and the Strategic Initiative. Excluding these charges, net income for the first quarter of 2002 was $16.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $.44 per share.
 
MANAGEMENT COMMENT
 
Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report record first quarter results that were in line with our earlier expectations. Sales to all of the markets we serve increased over the prior year despite ongoing price competition. The increase in sales reflects strong organic growth, particularly in the food/beverage, personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets, and foreign currency translation effects.
 
"While our operating income increased compared to the prior year excluding nonrecurring charges, as a percentage of sales it decreased slightly. The positive effect of the weaker dollar from the translation of foreign results was mitigated by increased costs of imports to the U.S. Also, we experienced higher than expected start-up costs related to an unusually large number of new product introductions in the food/beverage market.
 
"However, increased sales resulted in improved overhead utilization and we continue to benefit from our cost reduction efforts. These factors, combined with lower interest expense, helped drive diluted earnings per share to a record first quarter level." Siebel added.
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
 
For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 22 percent, to $219.2 million from $180.0 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the food/beverage, personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets. First quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $29.9 million from $26.1 million in the prior year.
 
For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 15 percent, to $47.9 million from $41.6 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased demand from the personal care market. First quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $4.6 million from $3.2 million a year ago on a comparable basis primarily due to increased sales and continued cost savings.
 
See the appended supplemental segment information schedule for a reconciliation of the above amounts to the Company's financial statements.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Siebel commented, "Looking forward to 2003, we are uncertain as to how our customers and end consumers will act in light of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and the general economic environment. Also, due to a reduction in international travel, it is particularly difficult to predict how demand for our fragrance/cosmetic customers' products and our sales to this market will be affected. Despite these events, we remain cautiously optimistic about the year.
 
"As we enter the second quarter, the positive momentum in the food/beverage and personal care markets is expected to continue. Early indications point to increases in sales to the fragrance/cosmetic market compared to the same period a year ago. We anticipate that sales of our products to the pharmaceutical market will improve as the year progresses."
 
Siebel concluded, "Presently, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2003 to be in the range of $.52 to $.57 per share compared to $.48 per share reported in 2002 (or $.50 per share excluding charges related to the Strategic Initiative)."
 
CASH DIVIDEND
 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.06 per share, payable May 22, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 1, 2003.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2003, sales increased 24 percent to a record $288.1 million from $233.2 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 11 percent from the prior year.

SIX MONTHS RESULTS
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2003, sales increased 22 percent to $553.2 million from $451.9 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 10 percent from the prior year.

In the first six months of 2002, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $2.7 million related to a patent dispute settlement and $.9 million for the Strategic Initiative.
 
MANAGEMENT COMMENT
 
Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased to report another quarter of record results. While we continue to face price competition in all of our markets, pricing pressure is mitigated by our ability to offer innovative new products and further penetrate the markets we serve. The weak U.S. dollar relative to the same period a year ago contributed to the increase in sales. Foreign currency translation effects aside, sales were
particularly strong to the food/beverage, personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets while sales to the pharmaceutical market were slightly above the prior year."
 
Siebel added, "Our operating income for the second quarter increased over the prior year. However, operating income continues to be adversely impacted by effect of the weaker dollar on cross-currency transactions such as when we produce with Euro-based costs and sell in U.S. dollars. The negative effect from our cross-currency transactions offset the favorable translation of foreign denominated results and adversely affected operating income as a percentage of sales. The combination of higher operating income and lower net interest expense drove diluted earnings per share to an all-time quarterly high."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
 
For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 26 percent, to $243.2 million from $192.9 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the personal care, fragrance/cosmetic and food markets and changes in exchange rates. For the first six months, sales increased 24 percent to $462.3 million from $373.0 million in the prior year. Second quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $33.9 million from $30.3 million in the prior year. For the first six months, EBIT for the segment increased to $63.8 million from $56.4 million in the prior year.
 
For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 9 percent, to $46.8 million from $43.0 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar. Increased sales to the personal care market offset a decline in sales to the household market. For the first six months, sales increased 12 percent to $94.7 million from $84.6 million in the prior year. Second quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $4.2 million from $3.0 million a year ago due to the mix of products sold and continued cost savings. For the first six months, EBIT increased to $8.8 million from $6.2 million in the prior year.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Siebel commented, "Looking forward, the horizon of sales visibility continues to be short. Currently, we expect the increase in sales excluding translation effects in the third quarter of 2003 to be in the area of 5 to 10 percent over the prior year's level. A modest reduction in the incoming order rate we are seeing from fragrance/cosmetic customers is expected to be more than offset by sales increases to the other markets."
Siebel concluded, "Presently, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003 to be in the range of $.50 to $.55 compared to $.49 per share in the prior year."
 
INCREASED CASH DIVIDEND
 
The Board of Directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $.07 per share, payable August 19, 2003 to shareholders of record as of July 29, 2003. The new dividend rate represents a 17 percent increase over the prior dividend rate.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Third Quarter Results; Announces Dry Powder Inhalation Technology Acquisition and Related Charge of $1.3 Million; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2003--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record third quarter results. The Company also announced the acquisition of technology for dry powder inhalation and a charge of approximately $1.3 million (before taxes) relating to the acquisition. Third Quarter Results For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, sales increased 17 percent to $281.3 million from $239.8 million in the prior year. Approximately $12 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 9 percent from the prior year. Net income for the third quarter of 2003 increased to a record third quarter level of $19.1 million from $17.8 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.51 per share compared to $.49 per share in the prior year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $1.3 million ($.8 million after taxes) related to research and development costs associated with dry powder technology acquired during the quarter. Nine Months Results For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, sales increased 21 percent to $834.5 million from $691.6 million in the prior year. Approximately $20 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 10 percent from the prior year. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 increased to $59.7 million from $48.6 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.62 per share compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year. The results for the first nine months of 2003 include the third quarter charge of approximately $1.3 million ($.8 million after taxes) related to research and development costs associated with the acquired dry powder technology. In the first nine months of 2002, the Company recorded charges of $4.2 million ($2.7 million after taxes) related to a patent dispute settlement and $1.4 million ($.9 million after taxes) for the Strategic Initiative. Management Comment Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report another quarter of record results. Higher unit volume, custom tooling sales and the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to the sales increase. Excluding foreign currency translation effects and custom tooling sales, food/beverage market sales continued to show strong growth; sales to the pharmaceutical and personal care markets increased moderately; fragrance/cosmetic market sales were flat and sales to the household market declined from the prior year." Siebel added, "Our operating income for the third quarter increased over the prior year. However, operating income as a percent of sales was adversely impacted by the effect of the weaker dollar on cross-currency transactions, the expensing of acquired research and development costs, custom tooling sales which typically have a lower margin than our product sales and continued price competition. The combination of higher operating income and lower net interest expense contributed to the record third quarter diluted earnings per share." Dry Powder Inhalation Technology Acquisition Recent developments in the pharmaceutical market, including escalating research activity in powder formulations, advances in particle engineering and novel device architectures have positioned dry powder inhalation as a significant factor in the noninvasive drug delivery sector. The Company acquired intellectual property and equipment relating to certain dry powder technology during the third quarter. Siebel explained, "This acquisition is important from a strategic standpoint as it will ensure that we are well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities in the pharmaceutical market as the industry moves to offer more dry powder forms of medications using noninvasive drug delivery methods. In this case, accounting rules require that acquired research and development costs be expensed and, accordingly, we recorded a charge relating to this acquisition in the third quarter." Business Segment Performance For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 19 percent, to $234.8 million from $197.5 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales (including custom tooling) to the pharmaceutical, personal care, and food markets and changes in exchange rates. For the first nine months, sales increased 22 percent to $697.2 million from $570.4 million in the prior year. Third quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $31.1 million from $29.6 million in the prior year. For the first nine months, EBIT for the segment increased to $94.9 million from $86.0 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 9 percent, to $48.4 million from $44.4 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar and increased sales to the personal care market. For the first nine months, sales increased 11 percent to $143.1 million from $129.1 million in the prior year. Third quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $4.7 million from $3.0 million a year ago. For the first nine months, EBIT increased to $13.5 million from $9.2 million in the prior year. Outlook Siebel commented, "As I have mentioned throughout 2003, the horizon of our sales visibility continues to be very short. This makes our ability to forecast quite difficult. Based upon current information, we expect sales to the food/beverage market to continue to be strong. However, we are seeing a slowdown in the incoming order rate from the fragrance/cosmetic market and we have received notification of a planned inventory reduction by a major pharmaceutical customer. Both of these are expected to negatively impact the fourth quarter. Currently, we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 will be in the range of $.45 to $.50 compared to $.50 per share in the prior year." Cash Dividend Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.07 per share, payable November 19, 2003 to shareholders of record as of October 29, 2003. Open Conference Call There will be a conference call on Friday, October 17, 2003 at 8:00 a.m. CST to discuss the Company's third quarter results for 2003.

Exhibit Index ------------- Exhibit No. - ----------- 99.1 Press Release of AptarGroup, Inc. dated February 11, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Record Fourth Quarter Sales Propel AptarGroup Past One Billion Dollar Sales Mark CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 11, 2004--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record sales and net income for the fourth quarter and year 2003. Annual sales surpassed the one billion mark for the first time. Fourth Quarter Results For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, sales increased 19 percent to $280.1 million from $235.1 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately seven percent from the prior year. Approximately $8 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $20.0 million versus $18.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.54 per share compared to $.50 per share in the prior year. Annual Results For the year ended December 31, 2003, sales increased 20 percent to $1.1 billion from $926.7 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately nine percent from the prior year. Approximately $29 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Net income for the year increased to $79.7 million from $66.6 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $2.16 per share compared to $1.82 per share in the prior year. The results for the year 2003 include a third quarter charge of approximately $1.3 million ($.8 million after taxes) related to research and development costs associated with acquired dry powder technology. In 2002, the Company recorded charges of $4.2 million ($2.7 million after taxes) related to a patent dispute settlement and $1.7 million ($1.1 million after taxes) for its Strategic Initiative. Management Comment Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report another quarter of record results. Higher unit volume, custom tooling sales and the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to the sales increase. Excluding foreign currency translation effects, sales to the personal care, pharmaceutical, and food/beverage markets increased. Sales to the household market were flat and fragrance/cosmetic market sales declined from the prior year." Siebel added, "Our operating income for the fourth quarter increased over the prior year and contributed to the record fourth quarter earnings per share. However, operating income as a percent of sales continues to be adversely impacted by the effect of the weaker dollar on cross-currency transactions, custom tooling sales which typically have a lower margin than our product sales and continued price competition." Reflecting on the year, Siebel said, "We are very pleased to report that 2003 sales surpassed the $1 billion mark and our profits reached a record level. This reflects the strength of the Company due to the diversity of our product range, markets served and geographic presence." Business Segment Performance For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 18 percent, to $231.7 million from $196.4 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the personal care, pharmaceutical, and food/beverage markets which were partially offset by reduced sales to the fragrance/cosmetic market. Additionally, changes in exchange rates also positively affected sales. For the year, sales increased 21 percent to $928.9 million from $766.8 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $30.4 million from $28.5 million in the prior year. For the year, EBIT for the segment increased to $125.3 million from $114.5 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 23 percent, to $50.7 million from $41.3 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar and increased sales of custom tooling and products for the personal care market. For the year, sales increased 14 percent to $193.8 million from $170.3 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $2.6 million from $1.8 million a year ago. For the year, EBIT increased to $16.1 million from $11.1 million in the prior year. Outlook Siebel commented, "Our ability to forecast continues to be hampered by the short horizon of sales visibility. Presently, we expect continued softness in demand from the fragrance/cosmetic market in the first quarter of 2004 to be offset by increased demand from other markets. We anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2004 will equal or slightly exceed the $.53 per share recorded in the prior year. Despite what looks to be a relatively slow start to 2004, we are cautiously optimistic on the year as a whole." Open Conference Call There will be a conference call on Thursday, February 12, 2004 at 8:00 a.m. CST to discuss the Company's results. The call will last approximately one hour and feature remarks by Carl A. Siebel and Stephen J. Hagge, AptarGroup's Chief Financial Officer.

Exhibit Index ------------- Exhibit No. - ----------- 99.1 Press Release of AptarGroup, Inc. dated April 15, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter Results; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 15, 2004--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record sales and income for the first quarter of 2004. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, sales increased 19 percent to $315.6 million from $265.1 million in the prior year. Approximately $11 million of the increase in sales relates to increased custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately eight percent from the prior year. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 increased to $21.2 million from $19.2 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.57 per share compared to $.53 per share in the prior year. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report record first quarter results. Sales to all of the markets we serve increased over the prior year. The increase in sales reflects volume growth in all markets except for the pharmaceutical market, higher custom tooling sales and foreign currency translation effects. "Pharmaceutical sales in the quarter included an increase in custom tooling sales of approximately $7 million over the prior year, the majority of which relates to the second phase of a project that accounted for approximately $13 million in total custom tooling sales in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. However, the customer associated with this project has informed us of their decision to cancel the launch of the related product. While we did not forecast any product sales from this project in 2004, previously expected product sales in late 2005 and beyond will not be realized. Excluding custom tooling sales and the effect of foreign currency translation, sales to the pharmaceutical market decreased from the prior year." Siebel added, "We continue to focus on innovation while containing costs. During the first quarter we evaluated our worldwide mold making capacity and decided to eliminate a mold making operation in the United States which employed approximately 40 people. It's never an easy decision to close an operation but we felt it was necessary to streamline this part of our business and reduce costs. This facility is scheduled to cease operations in the second quarter of 2004. Charges in the first quarter relating to the closing of this operation were not significant and additional related charges in the future are not expected to be significant. "Operating income as a percent of sales for the quarter was negatively affected by price competition, weakness in pharmaceutical product sales, increased cost of imports to the U.S. due to the weaker dollar and increased cost of raw materials. However, our operating income increased compared to the prior year and contributed to the record first quarter earnings per share." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 20 percent, to $262.2 million from $219.2 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the food/beverage and personal care markets and increased sales of custom tooling to the pharmaceutical market. Additionally changes in exchange rates also positively affected sales. First quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $31.3 million from $29.9 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 16 percent, to $55.8 million from $47.9 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased demand from the personal care market. First quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $5.3 million from $4.6 million a year ago. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "The positive momentum in the first quarter is expected to continue into the second quarter. We also anticipate that our pharmaceutical volumes will trend upward in the second quarter and continue to improve throughout the year. Additionally, we have filed for income tax refunds totaling approximately $1.5 million in the U.S. relating to research and development expenditures incurred from 2000 through 2002. These refunds will be recognized as a reduction of our tax provision when they are received. Excluding the potential effect of these tax refunds net of related contingent consulting fees, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2004 to be in the range of $.58 to $.63 per share." CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.07 per share, payable May 21, 2004 to stockholders of record as of April 30, 2004. OPEN CONFERENCE CALL There will be a conference call on Friday, April 16, 2004 at 8:00 a.m. CST to discuss the Company's first quarter results.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup, Inc. First Quarter 2004 Earnings Conference Call Apr. 16. 2004 - 8:00AM CT Call Transcript - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

Our speakers for today are Mr. Carl Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer for AptarGroup, and Mr. Steve Hagge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Siebel. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Carl Siebel speaking. I'll briefly discuss the quarter and the outlook before turning it over to Steve Hagge, who will provide more detailed information about our results. In yesterday's release, we reported record first-quarter sales and income. Overall, sales increased due to higher volumes, custom tooling sales and the impact of the weaker dollar on the translation of foreign sales. Looking at the markets, excluding the foreign currency translation effects, sales to all of our markets increased. Sales to the food and beverage, household and personal care markets were strong, while fragrance/cosmetics sales increased slightly over the prior year. Sales to the pharmaceutical market increased primarily due to custom tooling sales. As we have pointed out in the press release, most of the increase in tooling sales related to one custom project for a pharmaceutical customer. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange and this specific custom project, pharmacy sales decreased from the prior year. We noted that this pharmaceutical customer informed us of their decision to cancel the launch of the product related to this project and this investment. As a result, previously expected sales in late 2005 and beyond 2005 relating to this specific project will not be realized. The custom project was to create a new dispensing system for an existing product for which we are supplying, since quite some time, the current dispensing device. We evidently expect sales of this current system to continue into the future with this customer. Operating income as a percent of sales for the quarter was negatively impacted by the following -- first, price competition; second, weakness in pharmaceutical product sales; third, the higher cost of imports to the U.S. from the weaker dollar; and finally, increased material costs. Our outlook is generally optimistic for the second quarter of 2004. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter is expected to continue into the second quarter. We also anticipate that pharmaceutical volumes will improve in the second quarter and expect this trend of improvement to continue throughout the year. If we put aside any potential impact from the tax refunds mentioned in the press release, we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2004 will be in the range of 58 to 63 cents per share, versus the 58 cents per share recorded in the second quarter of 2003. Now, Steve can provide more details about the tax refunds in a moment. I would like to turn it over to Steve now for his review of the financial results. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. I will review the financial information and then Carl and I will be happy to answer any of your questions. Looking at the quarter, as Carl indicated, we reported sales increase of 19 percent, whereas sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, grew at approximately 8 percent from the prior year. Our custom tooling sales in the quarter increased $11 million over the prior year with most of that increase coming from tooling sales related to the pharmaceutical market. Looking at sales to each of the markets for the quarter, excluding changes in exchange rates, in the personal care market, we were up in the upper single digit area. We were up slightly in the fragrance/cosmetic market. We were up around 10 percent, including tooling sales, in the pharmaceutical market, up in the low teen area for household and up almost 30 percent in the food market, and our other non-packaging was about flat. As Carl mentioned, if we exclude the tooling in pharma sales, we would have been down slightly if you exclude exchange rates. Cost of sales as a percent of sales during the quarter was higher than we reported in the prior year for the reasons Carl already mentioned. Our shutdown costs related to the U.S. mold making operation were approximately $0.5 million which, combined with our operating losses, totaled approximately $1 million. This was largely offset by a gain on (indiscernible) building we had during the quarter.
Compliance costs for Sarbanes-Oxley and our U.S. healthcare costs continued to increase from 2003 but despite this, SG&A as a percentage of sales improved somewhat on a year-to-year basis. We also benefited from lower net interest and a lower tax rate during the quarter, compared to prior year. Bottom-line, we reported diluted earnings per share of 57 cents, compared to 53 cents in 2003. From a geographic basis, sales to our customers by our European operations represented 63 percent of net sales in the quarter, versus 61 percent last year. Sales to customers by our U.S. operations accounted for 29 percent of sales during the quarter, versus 31 percent of sales last year. The increase in the European percentage is largely due to the stronger euro in 2003 compared to the prior year. Excluding changes in exchange rates, the Dispensing Systems and the SeaquistPerfect segment sales each increased approximately 8 percent. We experienced very strong cash flow from operations during the quarter with approximately $35 million generated, versus approximately 22 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $19 million, compared to 18 million in 2003. From a balance sheet perspective, our return on average equity was approximately 11 percent and our net debt to net capital is approximately 5 percent. Looking forward, we expect our total cash outlays for Capital Expenditures in 2004 to be in the area of approximately $90 million with Depreciation and Amortization to also be in approximately that same area. Both of these may change depending on what happens to exchange rates throughout the year. We have filed for approximately 1.5 million of tax refunds related to Research and Development expenditures incurred in the years 2000 through 2002. The timing of the recognition of these refunds is uncertain and the individual quarterly tax rates during 2004 will vary depending on when these credits are realized. Overall, the effective tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 31 to 32 percent. At this time, Carl and I would be glad to answer any of your questions. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos of Banc of America. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning or good afternoon, Carl. Steve, I was wondering if you could tell us if $11 million was the net increase in tooling sales, what does that represent as a percentage of total tooling sales for the business? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 13 million was the total tooling sales in the quarter, and about 11 million was the increase. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So there was very little of it last year, then, in total tooling sales, correct? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the first quarter, correct. You'll see, throughout the year, we were a little over 30 million for the full year last year, so the first quarter was our softest quarter for tooling sales in 2003. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. You've already given us some color, both in terms of fragrance where you were up only slightly and you had a tough comparison last year in pharma. You know, you saw reduced volumes there, ex-the tooling. But if I adjust for tooling, the top line growth, ex-foreign exchange, was quite low compared to typical Aptar standards. Are there any other issues or could you give us any more color behind the relative slow pace of growth in the quarter versus a year ago? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. George, first of all, let's talk a minute about the fragrance/cosmetics market. We had a huge increase in the fragrance/cosmetics markets in the first quarter 2003 over 2002. Going into the first quarter of this year, we were seeing some slowness. For month-to-month, this has been improving and essentially we've had a very small but we still, over a very strong record quarter 2003 in the first quarter, we feel that we had a pretty good -- at the end -- first quarter, 2004. Our incoming orders have continued to increase from month-to-month. It's still, as I mentioned in the past, it's still a very short visibility but we are optimistic for the second quarter in the fragrance/cosmetics market to continue, that the sales will continue to improve. We have indications from major customers that their sales are going reasonably well. We also, in the area of new product activity and the development of specific product-for-product launches, we have a gain, an increase in projects in the first quarter this year over the first quarter last year. So overall, we don't think that -- we really think that the market isn't that bad at this point. We really have to point out that the comparison with the first quarter of last year was a difficult one, and you may remember first-half, we had a very strong business fragrance/cosmetics and then it tails off in the second half. The other point to make is in the pharmaceutical business. In the pharmaceutical business, we mentioned already before that we had a customer who has been heavily destocking after very strong purchases from us in 2002, starting to destock in 2003 and most likely visibly hit the real low volume for us in the first quarter of this year. He has now been talking about and we've
seen first orders that he resumes for purchasing. We haven't lost anything; we haven't lost any marketshare. It's a pure movement in inventory. But since there are only a few customers in the pharmaceutical business in general, if one major customer makes a movement like that, that has a major impact. That has had an impact on our margins in the first quarter and naturally has had a major impact on our sales. The rest of our pharmaceutical business we judge as being pretty strong in the first quarter. So, it's just this one customer who has eliminated essentially the growth for us in the first quarter. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl, you mentioned last quarter that this customer would be destocking to Q1. At this juncture, do you think he or she is done? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, as I said, George, he has been starting to give us new orders at a low pace but anyway, we see an improvement in the second quarter, and we expect an improvement in the second half, so we believe that we've hit the bottom there. The last point I want to make is that the food business, while we have an increase in the first quarter 2003 over the first quarter 2002 of 50 percent, we have, on top of that, another increase in the first quarter 2004 over the first quarter 2003 of 30 percent. So, we continue to see very good success in the food business. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. One last question and then I'll turn it over to the other folks. Steve, are you getting the benefit from strategic initiative that you thought you would on the margin line? You know, margins have been at relatively low levels probably for the reasons that Carl just went over. But are you getting a lift from the cost reductions that you thought you would, because again, margins are at pretty low levels relative to history? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, we can actually go back and track where the strategic initiative savings that we'd anticipated (sic), and we have achieved those. The difficulty that we've had is in that part of the market which relates largely to the low end of the fragrance/cosmetics. We've had to give up a certain amount of those savings to a large degree in terms of price. So as Carl has mentioned, when you get to the margin side in the quarter, the other thing that is hurt is, over the last year and a half, has been the very strong dollar, which has squeezed the margins we have, particularly on our U.S. imports. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, that's the imports from Asia? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, on the fragrance market, it is continuing the competition, including the Asian side, so Asia is a piece of that. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, guys. I'll be back. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin with Blackrock Capital. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning. Could you quantify the percent in margin -- when you talk about the pricing impact, the imports coming in the U.S. that are based in euro costs, and then the raw materials and the lower pharma sales -- could you talk about what percent of the margin contraction each of those had? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The difficulty is is that if you look at it on the currency side, we don't have it specifically broken out for each one. Currency, for us, is about half to 1 percent decline in the margin over what it would have been on a constant-currency basis. So it's about half -- frankly half the change from where we were a year ago. The other piece is it's just difficult to come back because you've got the mix and you certainly have some underutilization in our pharmaceutical operations but an increase in the food, so it's very difficult to come back and quantify those other pieces. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. When you talk about pricing pressure, I guess -- you often talk about pricing pressures. Is this -- are competitors getting more aggressive on the margin, or is the same that you've been seeing the last couple of quarters? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think that, if you want to make a general statement here, it's always difficult to generalize. But in essence, other than the Asian impact, which has grown over the last three or four years, we have not seen a major change in the competitive environment. We've always operated in a competitive environment. Pricing continues to be under pressure from the customers and from the marketers. Some of that is Asian-driven, as we said, but the most intense pricing pressure understandably we have in the low end of the fragrance/cosmetics market and in some of our closure business. We see some increased activity from our Asian competitors, number one by them exporting finished fragrance packages and then using pumps which have been produced by
very small, family-owned businesses in China, and some also directly by offerings of pumps. But in general, I would say that the competitive environment has not gone through a major change. So, we have to continue on our strategy, on one side, to be very active in our cost-reductions and I think we have been quite successful. One of those things was mentioned just when we talked about the strategic initiative George Staphos was asking the question. There are other constant, ongoing activities in all of our divisions to reduce costs and naturally, the other side is our effort to bring new products to the markets to fight against the commodization of our products. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you quantify the raw material price increase impact? How are your contracts set up? When can you past those on? What's the lag effect? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On the pass-on, in general, it is a market condition, the closure business, that you have pass-through clauses and as always, you could roughly count, on a two-month delay, on passing those on. We also have, in some of the other areas, pass-through clauses and we're also evaluating right now because the raw material increases, as you know, are not only significant in the plastic side but they are also on the metal side. So, we are evaluating the possibility of price increases in the other areas of our business where we do not have normally formal pass-through conditions. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We were estimating that, during the quarter, we probably passed on, in terms of resin, in the area of about $1.2 million worth of increases. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Out of? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Again, we are still probably -- again, as Carl said, we are still on a lag basis, so it's been continuing to increase, so it's hard to tell in terms of the total. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I just -- 1.2 doesn't mean much, you know, on absolute basis. I didn't know what percentage that is. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm guessing there is probably another million that we're still in the process of passing through, if you look at where the totals are at. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Then looking at -- you know, great cash flow, looking at your balance sheet, it's clearly an under-leveraged balance sheet. What is your strategy to improve your return on capital? Is it via acquisition, or stock buyback? I mean, what's the strategy to improve the returns here? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are continuing to evaluate, on a strategic basis, all potential acquisitions which we see as a possibility. We have been doing this in the past and will continue to do this. We're looking at potential for in terms of geographic expansion, market share and naturally also new technologies, new products, and specifically in areas where we would be able to buy into intellectual property rights, things like that. So, that's one side. As you know, the Board has authorized a 3 million share buyback, out of which we have used up roughly half, and we continue to be in the market from time to time. We will also -- the Board will continue to evaluate the potential of our dividend policies. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, then last question and I'll turn it over -- the tax rate, as you alluded to, was a little low, year-over-year. Is that expected -- what sort of tax rate can we expect for the year? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think if you look at -- it's a low compared to the first quarter of last year but essentially very comparable to the full year. We had about a 32 percent tax rate in 2003. So, we are expecting, as I mentioned, that there is the potential for some tax credits on some refunds that we have which are amounting to about 1.5 million. The timing of the recognition of those will depend on when we received those. Overall, I would guess our overall rates, including that for the year, assuming we receive those in 2004, would be in the area of 31 percent or so. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edmond Griffin, - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, thank you for the time. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Manuel with KeyBank Capital Market.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Manuel, KeyBank Capital Markets - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you. First, in the area of your new product pipeline, can you talk about -- I know you mentioned that you have a pickup, year-over-year, in product development and things of that nature. Can you talk about what areas you're seeing the most interest in? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The first area, as proven by our growth, is the food and beverage area, which is a new market for us where we are relatively small but where we have grown significantly over the last two or three years and we continue to grow, see very good growth this year. There, the biggest driver in this is the inverted packaging. As you have seen it, with sauces, captured products and so on, where worldwide we have created a very, very strong demand. Since our technology there is also patented, we have an excellent position to promote that for the future. We have seen the first time, recently, of an introduction of a pouch which is normally used, as you know, with a straw. Using our SimpliSqueeze system, we've developed over the last two or three years, together with a pouch manufacturer and also a with filling-machine manufacturer, the technologies necessary to introduce our dispensing system into pouches, which will be a very, very big opportunity, may be as big as the bottled water area, where we continue to be successful. The first product using this pouch with our closure is a sports drink under the name of Energice. That's introduced by a company called Ascendia. The there's also a new energy drink called Hydrade, which will soon be available at 7-Eleven convenience stores. We have also had a very successful product introduction for bottled water in China by a company called YST and a product called Scream. We think that's very significant because, in China, you would have not expected that a more expensive and very convenient dispensing system would make a major breakthrough. In effect, that has happened and the customer reports that he is increasing market share and is very successful. He's been increasing his forecast for his requirements for this year. So that's one side. The water side, bottled water market, is increasing worldwide, as you know, and the desire to more convenient dispensing systems is getting ever stronger. The other area where we are growing is in the perfume/cosmetic business. We have been interesting, over the last years, research and development in manufacturing in the area of small, portable dispensing devices for sampling but also for potential reuse and resale. There, we have first products on the market; we have a great product pipeline coming up for the next two or three years in which we have invested considerable research and development efforts and money over the last two or three years. So, we believe that that is a potential, very fast-growing market which will add to our success in the perfume/cosmetic business for the future. Naturally, last but not least in the pharmaceutical business, we have quite a few projects, but that is much more long-term. One example is the dry powder inhaler system, where we have worked on internally for quite some time and then added by our -- to our intellectual property portfolio by a major acquisition last year, technology for a new dry powder inhaler, which we believe is again a major improvement on the existing used technology on the market.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Manuel, KeyBank Capital Markets - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Along the lines of the pharmaceutical side of your business, can you give us a feel for how many products you have potentially in late stages that we could see this year, either in number or how would that compare more versus last year or six months ago, something of that nature? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is very difficult for us to quantify and to give a clear indication where our customers stand because, as you know, we start developing with the customers once the molecule has been developed and they go into formulation, and they go into the dispensing system. So, you have to go through clinical trials, FDA approval and what not. We are not able to forecast or to make a very good, strong judgment where, in the development cycle, at the customer, these products are. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Manuel, KeyBank Capital Markets - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right, thank you very much. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Rodgers of LJR Great Lakes Review. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Rodgers, LJR Great Lakes Review - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wanted to know about the debt, if you had the numbers on what the blended rate was for the quarter and what percent was variable? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's about 50 percent variable, 50 percent fixed. The overall average rate is probably in the area of 3.5 to 4 percent when you take the combination. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Rodgers, LJR Great Lakes Review - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Is that still in the process of being -- the revolver being renegotiated? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We finished it in February; that's done. The revolver was $100 million, and we've increased the revolver to 150 million. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A follow-up question with George Staphos of Banc of America.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The last question on margin, at least for me -- Steve, Carl, at this juncture, you don't think there's anything in your developing mix of business that would tend to, over time, be reducing your margins from where they've been? Would that be a fair assessment? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. First of all, the answer to the question is yes, we don't see anything which would reduce because essentially, up to now, we've been able and we believe strongly that this will continue -- that when we develop and introduce new products, we introduce them with higher margins. As long as you bring something really innovative which meets a market need, then in all cases, you can start out with a considerably higher margin. Now, these margins then tend eventually to go down, but that's depending on the market and depending on the value of the product you give to the marketer and to the consumer -- takes more or less longer but the initial start is essentially longer. We believe that we have a lot of good reasons and good projects for the next nine months that -- so that we should see rather an increase rather a decrease in our margins. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl, could the growth in food be helpful to your mix over time? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. In effect. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So is that the higher margin business for you? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. In effect the, food business, because of the innovative nature of the products we have brought to the food industry, carries a higher margin than our standard closure business. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Some last questions, kind of odds and ends -- how is Congers during? Has that plant come up the way you expected it to? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it has. The biggest single concern in that area was that it would take longer than expected to get the necessary FDA approvals and for the first major project to produce our customer for whom that was able to get this approval from the FDA faster than, in fact, than we had expected. We got that in November or December, if I remember right, and we expected that to be, in the earliest, in the second quarter of this year. So essentially from that side, in terms also of utilization of our capabilities, specifically in the pharmaceutical markets, we have been successful and we are also up to speed as expected in the fragrance/cosmetic market. As you know, our biggest concern, if you look at our overall business over the last two years, are the fluctuations of the currency. The best and only long-term way to protect way to protect yourself against those is to produce the accounts yourself. So therefore, we have been scaling up, as fast as possible, our manufacturing in Congers. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One of the other things too, Carl, that I think it's important to point out that Congers has been very beneficial with is that there's a couple of our customers' products that will be coming off-patent. The generic market is going to become a bigger piece of our overall business. Right now, Congers is going to be the primary location where we will be producing for that market segment. So, it's serving also a very strategic purpose for us today. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve, the equity income increase versus a year ago -- anything significant in there? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No, it's just that one of our -- the biggest piece of that is a joint venture that we have in France on an airless system, and that continues to improve in profitability as that market continues to expand. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Should we carry that run-rate for the whole year, do you think? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we will be up on a year-to-year basis. It's tough to go quarter-to-quarter, but we expect that business to significantly improve in profitability in 2004. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Last, you had mentioned -- I had missed it. You talked about the impact from closing the U.S. mold shop and you said there was some other item that, on
a combined basis, was $1 million. What was the other item that was non-recurring? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We had a facility in Switzerland where we were producing and we had since moved to a new location. We've sold that facility and that generated a gain of about one million. As I indicated, it was largely offset by the negatives we had on the tool-making operation. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, it was one million gain offset by half a million on the mold shop? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No, there was actually two pieces (sic) to the mold shop; there was about a half a million on the shutdown that we had to accrue on the shutdown, but in addition, we had about a $600,000 operating loss for that business in the first quarter -- about 1.1 million for the, if you will, combined loss for that operation in the quarter. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But that would have been operating -- not been selling it, right? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No. Basically, the reason it was such a large loss, we were in the phase-down period, so it was just lack of business. So, that will be non-recurring, particularly in the second half. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Staphos, Banc of America Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Where is the gain in the P&L? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The gain in the P&L is in cost of sales. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ghansham Panjabi with Lehman Brothers. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ghansham Panjabi, Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, guys. You know, one of your competitors in the UK in the pharmaceutical business has been consolidating that market over the last year
and a half or so. Do you feel that you have the critical mass in this business, looking out over the next five years, or should we expect some more acquisitions along the lines of pharma? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we certainly have been looking at all opportunities in the pharmaceutical business of acquisitions. I guess the acquisitions you are referring to are businesses which are making products on a contractual basis for a major customer. In this case, the intellectual property rights of that product are belonging to the customer. So, we had already, ten years ago, opted for not going after that part of the business and not going to produce this kind of dispensing system, as those two are two operations which have been acquired by one of our competitors. So, we certainly have the critical mass and virtually all of our business in the pharmaceutical area is based on strong intellectual property-right protection and also, naturally, know-how. In this business, we are by far the market leader worldwide. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ghansham Panjabi, Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, and just looking at the amount of cash you guys have on your balance sheet, is a special one-time dividend to shareholders -- is that in the realm of consideration? - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Hagge, AptarGroup Inc. - EVP, CFO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're looking at all options. The Board is going through a full, detailed analysis, so we're looking at dividend policies, one-time dividend, stock repurchase with the primary focus still being on the ability to use that in the acquisitions side, but we are evaluating all of those opportunities. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ghansham Panjabi, Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you so much. Good luck in the quarter. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton with RBC Dain. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain Rauscher - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, everyone. I certainly need some of your new energy drinks! (LAUGHTER). I was hoping you could comment on a couple of things. One, from my calculations on your incremental mold revenue, the foregone pharmaceutical upgrade represents about 20 percent of what you have done in incremental molds over the last three or four quarters. Can you give some kind of picture on flow and how we should think about the rest of that activity?
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Why we make some margin on that activity -- this is certainly -- it is a necessity and it helps our competitive position. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain Rauscher - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl, I apologize, but I will cut you off because I'm not clear enough on my question. What I'm really looking for is your thoughts on what that revenue follow-on and flow is, to the degree that you can talk about it. Because there is still an awful lot, if you will, of pent-up demand that's come from that mold activity that we haven't seen yet. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, this is a very -- let's call it "irregular" business. It goes up and down and depends on which kind of activity -- because it's naturally always a major investment for the customers. So, depending on their activity in the new product introductions and depending on their market conditions, this can go from 0 to 100 percent and back even between years. So, in effect, we have had, in this first quarter, a big spike because of this one specific situation with this one specific customer. But there is no indication that one could expect that this would continue and grow on a steady basis from this point on. So, we do not expect to have, in the next nine months, these kind of sales for new tooling and for assembly equipment, which may go with it. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain Rauscher - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On the other hand, though, you'd had -- I mean, excluding this customer in pharma, you probably had -- and the numbers you've given over the last three or four quarters -- 24 million in incremental tooling that by and large, we have yet to see sales flow beyond the tooling. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A lot of this has gone in specifically in the food and beverage markets. That's also why we continue to be very optimistic about our growth potential in this market. Another part goes in the personal care markets, where that is a much more constant business but naturally on a lower level, compared to a big spike in the pharmaceutical side, as you have seen. So, if we eliminate this specific point, we will see, with our business continuing to roll with more specialization continuing, both in perfume/cosmetic and also in the personal care (indiscernible) household. So, we would see a more-continuous flow of this kind of sales (sic) in the other markets; in the other markets, we would see that. But now the perfume and cosmetic markets, which has seen, every four or five years, a steeper decline and then spikes going up suddenly, that may be also more irregular but we see -- I would say, as I mentioned, that in the food and beverage side, on the personal care side, it would be more regular. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain Rauscher - Analyst - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair enough. That leads me into my final question, your feelings, going forward, on fragrance/cosmetic against a backdrop of what you're seeing with your global customers. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you look at the announcement, press releases and so on, which have come through over the last two or three months, the business seems to be picking up. That's also what we see across all of our businesses in the fragrance/cosmetic markets. We see a good improvement and we are reasonably optimistic for the next nine months in that business. At the same time, we have interesting new product introductions there, which have also helped. So, I believe that, in general, based on what the customers are telling us and based on what we have seen, an improved order flow, that we should have a reasonably good year this year in perfume/cosmetic. Naturally, the cosmetic market, which has a much stronger growth than that alcoholic-perfumery side, there, we also have brought to the market, in the last two or three years, excellent products and with those, we believe also that we may be able to gain some market share. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain Rauscher - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you very much for the insights. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At this time, I show no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Siebel. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl Siebel, AptarGroup Inc. - President, CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you very much. So, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everyone for participating in our call today. Thank you and good-bye. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect, and have a great day.

Exhibit Index ------------- Exhibit No. - ----------- 99.1 Press Release of AptarGroup, Inc. dated July 15, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Second Quarter Results; Doubles Dividend and Increases Share Repurchase Authorization CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 15, 2004--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record second quarter results. The Company's Board of Directors also increased the quarterly dividend to $.15 per share from $.07 per share and authorized the repurchase of an additional two million shares of common stock. SECOND QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, sales increased eight percent to a record $311.8 million from $288.1 million in the prior year. Approximately $2 million of the increase in sales relates to increased custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately four percent from the prior year. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 increased to a record $22.8 million from $21.3 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.61 per share compared to $.58 per share in the prior year. SIX MONTHS RESULTS For the six months ended June 30, 2004, sales increased 13 percent to a record $627.4 million from $553.2 million in the prior year. Approximately $13 million of the increase in sales relates to increased custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately six percent from the prior year. Net income for the first six months of 2004 increased to a record $44.0 million from $40.6 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.18 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the prior year. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Increased demand for our products together with the weak U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the Euro contributed to another quarter of growth and record sales for the Company. Excluding changes in exchange rates, sales to each market increased compared to a year ago with the exception of the pharmaceutical market, which, even though volumes increased year over year, showed a decline due to the mix of products sold. However, this decline in pharmaceutical product sales was largely offset by milestone revenue of $1 million related to a pharmaceutical customer project." Siebel added, "Our operating margins were pressured due to material price increases, price competition, the adverse effects of the weaker dollar on U.S. imports, and costs associated with the previously announced closing of a mold making facility. The Company recorded approximately $1 million of costs related to operating losses and shut down expenses of this facility in the quarter. The closing has been completed and we do not expect to incur any future significant costs related to this operation. In spite of these negative effects, the strength of our core business, the pharmaceutical project milestone, our cost containment efforts and lower income tax rates allowed us to post record quarterly earnings per share." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased eight percent, to $261.9 million from $243.2 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the food/beverage, personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets and changes in exchange rates. For the first six months, sales increased 13 percent to $524.1 million from $462.3 million in the prior year. Second quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $35.0 million from $33.9 million in the prior year. For the first six months, EBIT for the segment increased to $66.3 million from $63.8 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 11 percent, to $52.1 million from $46.8 million in the prior year. The increase is due to improved sales to the personal care and household markets, and the weaker U.S. dollar. For the first six months, sales increased 14 percent to $107.8 million from $94.7 million in the prior year. Second quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment increased to $4.8 million from $4.2 million a year ago due to the mix of products sold and continued cost savings. For the first six months, EBIT increased to $10.1 million from $8.8 million in the prior year. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Looking to the third quarter, we are optimistic that product sales to each of the markets we serve will increase over the prior year. As I discussed in our first quarter press release, we continue to expect sales to the pharmaceutical market to improve as the year progresses. Siebel concluded, "Also, as previously mentioned last quarter, we have filed for income tax refunds totaling approximately $1.5 million in the U.S. relating to research and development expenditures incurred from 2000 through 2002. These refunds will be recognized as a reduction of our tax provision when they are received. Excluding the potential effect of these tax refunds net of related contingent consulting fees, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2004 to be in the range of $.62 to $.67 compared to $.51 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $.15 per share, payable August 17, 2004 to shareholders of record as of July 27, 2004. This represents a 114% increase over the previous quarterly dividend of $.07 per share. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares of common stock under the current share repurchase program. Previously, the Board had authorized the Company to purchase up to three million share of common stock on the open market, of which one and one half million shares have been purchased cumulatively through the second quarter of 2004. The Board today approved the repurchase of an additional two million shares under the program bringing the total authorized to five million shares. Siebel commented, "Our strong financial position and cash generating ability has enabled the Board to take steps to enhance shareholder value. This substantial increase in the dividend rate, in combination with the increase in our share repurchase authorization, reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to improving shareholder returns. Also, with our strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities in the future."

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Third Quarter Results; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 14, 2004--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record sales and income for the third quarter of 2004. THIRD QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, sales increased 16 percent to a record $325.9 million from $281.3 million in the prior year. Approximately $5.9 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 10 percent from the prior year. Net income for the third quarter of 2004 increased to a record third quarter level of $25.3 million from $19.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.68 per share compared to $.51 per share in the prior year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $1.3 million ($.8 million after taxes) related to research and development costs associated with dry powder technology acquired during that quarter. NINE MONTHS RESULTS For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, sales increased 14 percent to a record $953.3 million from $834.5 million in the prior year. Approximately $18.6 million of the increase relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately seven percent from the prior year. Net income for the first nine months of 2004 increased to a record $69.3 million from $59.7 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.86 per share compared to $1.62 per share in the prior year. The results for the first nine months of 2003 include the third quarter charge of approximately $1.3 million ($.8 million after taxes) related to the research and development costs discussed above. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report another quarter of record results. Higher unit volume and the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to the sales increase. Sales to all of the markets we serve increased, with demand for our dispensing systems particularly strong from the pharmaceutical, fragrance/cosmetic and food markets. "The increase in unit volumes and a favorable mix of sales contributed to the improvement in operating income as a percent of sales over the prior year. Restraining further operating margin improvement was the adverse impact of the weaker dollar on imports to the U.S., increased costs of materials, higher quality-related costs, increased costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and continued price competition. "As previously announced, our strong balance sheet enabled us to increase the quarterly dividend rate from $.07 per share to $.15 per share beginning with the dividend we paid in August of this year. In addition, we spent $38.2 million to repurchase approximately 883 thousand shares during the third quarter. After considering both of these activities, we remain well-positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities in the future." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 18 percent to $276.3 million from $234.8 million in the prior year. The increase is due to increased sales (including custom tooling) to all markets and changes in exchange rates. For the first nine months, sales increased 15 percent to $800.4 million from $697.2 million in the prior year. Third quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the Dispensing Systems segment increased to $37.7 million from $31.1 million in the prior year. For the first nine months, EBIT for the segment increased to $104.0 million from $94.9 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased seven percent to $52.0 million from $48.4 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar and increased sales to the personal care market market. For the first nine months, sales increased 12 percent to $159.8 million from $143.1 million in the prior year. Third quarter EBIT for the SeaquistPerfect segment decreased to $4.3 million from $4.7 million a year ago. For the first nine months, EBIT increased to $14.4 million from $13.5 million in the prior year. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Based upon current information, we expect the positive momentum we experienced in the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter. Currently, we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2004 will be in the range of $.57 to $.62 compared to $.54 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable November 18, 2004 to shareholders of record as of October 28, 2004.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Annual Results; Announces Acquisition CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 9, 2005--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record sales and net income for the fourth quarter and year 2004. The Company also announced an agreement to acquire a Swiss company that owns proprietary dispensing packaging technology. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, sales increased 23 percent to a record $343.3 million from $280.1 million in the prior year. Approximately $7 million of the increase in sales relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 16 percent from the prior year. Net income increased to a fourth quarter record of $24.0 million from $20.0 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 20 percent to $.65 per share from $.54 per share in the prior year. ANNUAL RESULTS For the year ended December 31, 2004, sales increased 16 percent to a record $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in the prior year. Approximately $26 million of the increase relates to custom tooling sales. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately nine percent from the prior year. Net income for the year increased to a record $93.3 million from $79.7 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent to $2.51 per share from $2.16 per share in the prior year. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are delighted to report that higher unit volumes across all of the markets we serve led to another quarter of record results. Also, the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to the increase in sales. Demand for our dispensing systems was particularly strong from the food, pharmaceutical and fragrance/cosmetic markets. The increase in unit volumes and a favorable mix of sales more than offset the adverse impacts of the weaker dollar on imports to the U.S., increased costs of materials and continued price competition, and resulted in a 20 percent increase in net income for the quarter." Reflecting on the year, Siebel said "The year 2004 was one of our most successful years and marked our 39th consecutive year of increased sales. The broad-based demand for our products and the strength of the markets we serve resulted in another year of record sales and profits despite the challenges of competition, increased costs of materials and higher audit fees. During 2004, we demonstrated our commitment to improving shareholder returns by doubling our dividend and being more aggressive on our share repurchase activities. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are well-positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities in the future." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 26 percent to $292.0 million from $231.7 million in the prior year. The increase is due to increased sales (including custom tooling) to all markets and changes in exchange rates. For the year, sales increased 18 percent to $1.1 billion from $928.9 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter Dispensing Systems segment income (income before interest expense in excess of interest income, corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased to $38.7 million from $31.0 million in the prior year. For the year, segment income increased to $142.6 million from $125.9 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased seven percent to $54.1 million from $50.7 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar and increased sales to the personal care market. For the year, sales increased 10 percent to $213.9 million from $193.8 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $3.7 million from $2.0 million a year ago. For the year, segment income increased to $18.1 million from $15.5 million in the prior year. ACQUISITION AptarGroup also announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire, subject to certain government approvals and other customary closing conditions, EP Spray System SA, a company in Switzerland that manufactures aerosol valves with bag-on-valve technology. This technology physically separates the propellant from the product to be dispensed. It offers improved integrity of the product content, prevents expulsion of the propellant into the atmosphere and allows spraying of the product in any position. The purchase price was equivalent to approximately $29 million. EP Spray's sales for calendar 2004 were approximately $15 million. Commenting on the acquisition, Siebel said, "This acquisition broadens our product offerings and positions us better to serve this growing niche within the aerosol valve market". OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Based upon current information, we expect sales in the first quarter of 2005 to be moderately above last year's level and we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2005 will be in the range of $.58 to $.63 compared to $.57 per share in the prior year." OPEN CONFERENCE CALL There will be a conference call on Thursday, February 10, 2005 at 8:00 a.m. CST to discuss the Company's fourth quarter and annual results for 2004. The call will last approximately one hour and feature remarks by Carl A. Siebel and Stephen J. Hagge, AptarGroup's Chief Financial Officer.

Exhibit Index ------------- Exhibit No. - ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by AptarGroup, Inc. dated April 14, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 14, 2005--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record sales and net income for the first quarter of 2005. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, sales increased nine percent to a record $344.0 million from $315.6 million in the prior year. In the quarter, the Company recorded approximately $5 million of custom tooling sales compared to $13 million recorded in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately six percent from the prior year. Net income increased to a first quarter record of $22.1 million from $21.2 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased five percent to $.60 per share from $.57 per share in the prior year. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Increased sales of products across all of the markets we serve combined with price increases led to record first quarter sales. Demand for our dispensing systems was particularly strong from the food/beverage, personal care and household markets. Higher sales allowed us to overcome the adverse impacts of the weaker dollar on imports to the U.S., increased costs of materials and continued price competition, and resulted in record first quarter earnings. "Late in the quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a company in Switzerland that manufactures aerosol valves with bag-on-valve technology. We are excited to have this unique technology in our product line as it serves a growing niche within the aerosol valve market. The impact of this acquisition on the first quarter results was not significant." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased seven percent to $281.3 million from $262.2 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased sales to the personal care, food/beverage and fragrance/cosmetic markets and changes in exchange rates. Dispensing Systems segment income (income before interest expense in excess of interest income, corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased to $32.1 million from $31.3 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 17 percent to $65.5 million from $55.8 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased sales to the personal care and household markets, the acquisition of the company that makes bag-on-valves and the weaker U.S. dollar. SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $6.7 million from $5.3 million a year ago. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Looking forward, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue into the second quarter. Based upon current information, we anticipate demand to be particularly strong from the personal care, pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets." "As previously mentioned, we have filed for U.S. federal income tax refunds relating to research and development expenditures incurred from 2000 through 2002. We are in process of finalizing this matter and presently expect the tax benefit to be approximately $1.2 million. Also in Italy, the government has offered an incentive relating to taxation of government grants. We estimate that, if elected, the related reduction in income taxes would be in the area of $2.1 million in 2005. Excluding any impact of the pending tax-related items noted above, we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2005 will be in the range of $.68 to $.73 per share compared to $.61 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable May 20, 2005 to stockholders of record as of April 29, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports All-Time High Quarterly Results; Boosts Dividend 33 Percent CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 20, 2005--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record quarter results and declared an increased quarterly dividend. SECOND QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, sales increased 14 percent to a record $356.1 million from $311.8 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 11 percent from the prior year. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 increased to a record $29.3 million from $22.8 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 33 percent to $.81 per share compared to $.61 per share in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter included reduced income taxes of approximately $3.2 million ($.09 per diluted share) related to research and development credits in the U.S. and tax changes in Italy. SIX MONTHS RESULTS For the six months ended June 30, 2005, sales increased 12 percent to a record $700.1 million from $627.4 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately 8 percent from the prior year. Net income for the first six months of 2005, including the second quarter tax benefits described above, increased to a record $51.4 million from $44.0 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 19 percent to $1.41 per share compared to $1.18 per share in the prior year. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report that we continued to build on the momentum we experienced in the first quarter. We achieved a record level of quarterly sales as a result of strong demand for our products from the personal care, pharmaceutical, household and food/beverage markets. Sales to the fragrance/cosmetic market slowed in the quarter and were approximately equal to the prior year's level." Siebel added, "With increased volumes, we were able to leverage our infrastructure and realize operating efficiencies. In addition, we were successful in passing through the majority of our raw material cost increases. These factors contributed to our record earnings per share." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased 12 percent, to $294.5 million from $261.9 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the personal care, pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets and changes in exchange rates. For the first six months, sales increased 10 percent to $575.8 million from $524.1 million in the prior year. Dispensing Systems segment income (income before interest expense in excess of interest income, corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased to $39.7 million from $35.0 million in the prior year. For the first six months, Dispensing Systems segment income increased to $71.8 million from $66.3 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased 23 percent, to $64.2 million from $52.1 million in the prior year. The increase is due to improved sales to the personal care and household markets and the inclusion of sales from EP Spray System SA, which was acquired in the first quarter of this year. For the first six months, sales increased 20 percent to $129.6 million from $107.8 million in the prior year. Second quarter SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $6.3 million from $4.8 million a year ago. For the first six months, SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $13.1 million from $10.1 million in the prior year. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "We are optimistic that the trends we have experienced in the second quarter will continue into the third quarter. At the present time, we believe demand for our dispensing systems from all of the markets we serve, other than the fragrance/cosmetic market, will improve over prior year levels. In addition, we plan to reduce and redeploy certain personnel at our French fragrance/cosmetic operations. We plan to implement this program over a three year period and we expect to realize cost savings over time. Anticipated charges related to the first phase of this effort will be approximately $3 million in the second half of 2005 and will be recorded in the quarter in which they are recognizable for accounting purposes." Siebel concluded, "Excluding any effects of this program, we expect diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $.70 to $.75 compared to $.68 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $.20 per share, payable August 23, 2005 to shareholders of record as of August 2, 2005. This represents a 33 percent increase over the previous quarterly dividend of $.15 per share. Siebel commented, "Our Board continues to evaluate ways to enhance shareholder value. While we want to maintain flexibility to pursue opportunities that could contribute to our growth, we also recognize that our strong financial position and cash generating ability allow us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends. This increase, which follows last year's doubling of the dividend, is a clear indication of our commitment to our shareholders and our confidence in our business." SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY During the quarter, the Company repurchased 631,000 shares of common stock bringing the cumulative total shares repurchased under the current share repurchase program to approximately 3.5 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, the remaining balance of shares authorized for repurchase under the program was approximately 1.5 million shares.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Third Quarter Revenue and Strong Operational Results; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2005--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record third quarter revenue and strong operational results. The Company also declared a quarterly dividend. THIRD QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, sales increased five percent to a record $341.1 million from $325.9 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately four percent from the prior year. Custom tooling sales in the quarter decreased to $7.2 million from $17.9 million a year ago. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $24.9 million compared to $25.3 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.69 per share compared to $.68 per share in the prior year. Negatively impacting the third quarter 2005 net income were charges of approximately $2 million ($0.06 per diluted share) related to the previously announced Redeployment Program affecting AptarGroup's French fragrance/cosmetic operations. NINE MONTHS RESULTS For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, sales increased nine percent to a record $1.0 billion from $953.3 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased approximately seven percent from the prior year. Through September, custom tooling sales decreased to $25.0 million from $40.2 million a year ago. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 increased to $76.3 million from $69.3 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 13 percent to $2.10 per share compared to $1.86 per share in the prior year. Included in the 2005 nine month earnings per share is the positive impact of reduced income taxes recorded in the second quarter related to research and development credits in the U.S. and tax changes in Italy ($.09 per diluted share), and the negative effect of the Redeployment Program charges recorded in the third quarter ($.06 per diluted share). MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report strong operating results for the quarter and record revenue. Our company continued to grow in a period that posed challenges for many companies and individuals around the globe. Increased demand for our innovative dispensing systems from the personal care, pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets drove our record third quarter sales. Sales to the fragrance/cosmetic and household markets were approximately equal to the prior year's level." Siebel added, "We continue to diligently manage our costs and have implemented certain price increases to offset unavoidable cost increases. These efforts, combined with volume increases, allowed us to achieve strong profit growth in the quarter before considering the charges related to our Redeployment Program." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment increased four percent to $286.5 million from $276.3 million in the prior year, despite a decrease in custom tooling sales of approximately $10.7 million. The increase is mainly due to increased sales to the personal care, pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets. For the first nine months, sales increased eight percent to $862.3 million from $800.4 million in the prior year, despite a decrease in custom tooling sales of $15.2 million. Dispensing Systems segment income (income before interest expense in excess of interest income, corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased in the quarter to $43.0 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior year. For the first nine months, Dispensing Systems segment income increased to $114.8 million from $104.0 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased nine percent, to $56.5 million from $52.0 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to improved sales to the personal care market and the inclusion of sales from EP Spray System SA, which was acquired in the first quarter of this year. For the first nine months, sales increased 16 percent to $186.1 million from $159.8 million in the prior year. Third quarter SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $4.5 million from $4.3 million a year ago. For the first nine months, SeaquistPerfect segment income increased to $17.5 million from $14.4 million in the prior year. REDEPLOYMENT PROGRAM Siebel also stated, "As we mentioned last quarter, we are reducing and redeploying certain personnel at our French fragrance/cosmetic operations. We plan to implement this cost saving program over a three year period. In addition to the charges recorded in the third quarter, we expect to record additional after-tax charges of approximately $300,000 to $600,000 in the fourth quarter." OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "As announced on October 4, 2005, we acquired MBF Developpement SAS and related companies ("MBF"). With MBF's decorative technology, we are expanding our product offerings to better serve our fragrance/cosmetic customers. "Looking to the fourth quarter, we are in the midst of a challenging environment. The cost of doing business is increasing particularly when it comes to raw material, transportation and energy. However, we continue to aggressively control costs and we intend to increase prices to mitigate the adverse effects of increasing costs. Thankfully our operations are not located in areas affected by the two terrible storms that hit the Southern coast of the U.S. and we did not experience any interruption in our business. However, the effects of these events on our customers, suppliers and end consumers are difficult to predict." Siebel concluded, "Excluding any effects of the Redeployment Program, we expect diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $.62 to $.67 per share compared to record fourth quarter results of $.65 per share in 2004." CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.20 per share, payable November 23, 2005 to shareholders of record as of November 2, 2005. SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 200,000 shares of common stock bringing the cumulative total shares repurchased under the current share repurchase program to approximately 3.7 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, the remaining balance of shares authorized for repurchase under the program was approximately 1.3 million shares.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Fourth Quarter and Record Annual Results; Recaps Acquisition Activity CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 9, 2006--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record annual results in 2005 that were fueled by the Company's 40th consecutive year of increased sales as well as fourth quarter results in line with expectations. The Company also recapped its recent acquisition activity. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, sales decreased one percent to $338.8 million from $343.3 million in the prior year. Sales excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased three percent from the prior year. Custom tooling sales in the quarter decreased to $14.6 million from $18.3 million a year ago. Net income decreased in the fourth quarter to $23.7 million from $24.0 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased to $.66 per share from $.65 per share in the prior year. Negatively impacting the fourth quarter 2005 net income were charges of approximately $0.5 million ($.01 per diluted share) related to the previously announced Redeployment Program affecting AptarGroup's French fragrance/cosmetic operations. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) increased to approximately $11.7 million in the quarter compared to $6.3 million a year ago. ANNUAL RESULTS For the year ended December 31, 2005, sales increased six percent to a record $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales was not significant for the year. Custom tooling sales decreased to $39.6 million from $58.5 million a year ago. Net income for the year increased to a record $100.0 million from $93.3 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 10 percent to $2.77 per share from $2.51 per share in the prior year. Included in the 2005 earnings per share is the positive impact of reduced income taxes recorded in the second quarter related to previous years' research and development credits in the U.S. and tax changes in Italy ($.09 per diluted share), and the negative effects of the Redeployment Program charges recorded in the second half of the year ($.07 per diluted share). Free cash flow increased to a record level of approximately $90.5 million for the year compared to $63.5 million a year ago. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We had anticipated a decline in sales to the pharmaceutical market compared to strong fourth quarter 2004 sales to makers of generic pharmaceutical products. The adverse impact of this sales decline was mitigated primarily by increased sales to the food and beverage market and additional sales from companies acquired in 2005. Despite this mix of sales and rising raw material costs, we were able to maintain our operating margin due to our cost containment efforts and, by focusing on working capital, we were also able to grow free cash flow. Additionally, we benefited in the quarter from a lower effective tax rate." Siebel added "The year 2005 marked our 40th consecutive year of increased sales and we broke the $100 million net income mark for the first time in the Company's history. We also generated a record level of annual free cash flow. "This was also one of our most active periods in terms of acquisitions. We purchased several well run companies that will add to our future growth. In addition, to further enhance shareholder value we increased our dividend 33 percent and repurchased over 1.2 million shares of our stock. I'm pleased that after considering these actions and our recent acquisition activity, our balance sheet remains strong." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, sales of the Dispensing Systems segment decreased two percent to $285.1 million from $292.0 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales to the pharmaceutical market when compared to the strong fourth quarter 2004 which was driven by exceptionally strong sales to generic drug makers. For the year, sales increased five percent to $1.15 billion from $1.09 billion in the prior year. Fourth quarter Dispensing Systems segment income (income before interest expense in excess of interest income, corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) decreased to $38.4 million from $38.7 million in the prior year. For the year, segment income increased to $153.2 million from $142.6 million in the prior year. For the quarter, sales of the SeaquistPerfect segment increased two percent to $55.3 million from $54.1 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to additional sales from acquired businesses. For the year, sales increased 13 percent to $241.5 million from $213.9 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter SeaquistPerfect segment income decreased slightly to $3.6 million from $3.7 million a year ago. For the year, segment income increased to $21.1 million from $18.1 million in the prior year. ACQUISITION RECAP Carl Siebel commented on the Company's recent acquisition activity, "In addition to the first quarter 2005 acquisition of EP Spray System, a Swiss manufacturer of aerosol valves with bag-on-valve technology, we finished the year with several other strategic, bolt-on acquisitions. As we previously announced in the fourth quarter, we acquired MBF, a leading French designer and manufacturer of decorative packaging components primarily for the high end of the fragrance/cosmetic market. Later in the fourth quarter, we acquired the remaining half of AirlesSytems SAS (a 50/50 joint venture) for approximately $17 million. AirlesSystems, located in France, designs and manufactures unique dispensing systems that prevent air from entering the dispenser in order to protect product integrity and increase shelf life particularly, for cosmetic and skincare products. Finally, earlier this week we completed the acquisition of CCL Dispensing, a U.S. manufacturer of dispensing closures. "As we have indicated in the past, our strategy is to acquire businesses that possess unique technology, quality products and valuable market share. With these new products, technologies and capacity, we are enhancing the services and products we offer our global customers, and consequently, we are well positioned for future growth". STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING In accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter 2006, AptarGroup's income statement will begin reflecting non-cash expenses associated with stock options. AptarGroup estimates the full year impact of stock option costs based on current assumptions to be approximately $.24 per diluted share, of which $.13 per diluted share is expected to be recorded in the first quarter, with the remaining amount expected to be recorded ratably over the remaining quarters of the year. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "While the competitive environment remains challenging, we expect sales to our major markets to increase in the first quarter compared to the prior year excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates. We anticipate the first quarter earnings will be reduced by approximately $4.6 million ($.13 per diluted share) because of the adoption of the new stock option accounting rule. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2006 are currently expected to be in the range of $.53 to $.58, including the impact of expensing employee stock option program costs previously mentioned, compared to $.60 per share in the prior year." First Quarter 2006 Estimated Diluted Earnings Per Share THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, -------------------------------- Estimated 2006 Reported 2005 -------------- ------------- Diluted Earnings Per Share Before Stock Option Costs $.66 to $.71 $0.60 Impact of Stock Option Costs (.13) --- -------------------------------- Diluted Earnings Per Share $.53 to $.58 $0.60 ================================ OPEN CONFERENCE CALL There will be a conference call on Friday, February 10, 2006 at 8:00 a.m. CST to discuss the Company's fourth quarter and annual results for 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter Revenue; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2006--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter revenue. The Company also reported an 8% reduction in diluted earnings per share from the prior year's level due to the expensing of stock options in accordance with recent accounting regulations. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, sales increased 9% to a record $375.5 million from $344.0 million in the prior year. Sales growth was favorably impacted by acquisitions which added $25.6 million, or 7%, to AptarGroup's revenue and negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates which reduced revenues by approximately 5%. Net income in the quarter, including the effects of expensing stock options, was $19.8 million compared to $22.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.55 per share compared to $.60 per share in the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately $.02 per diluted share to earnings, while stock option expenses reduced earnings by approximately $.13 per diluted share. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We recorded strong top line growth over the prior year primarily due to increased demand for our dispensing closures and pharmaceutical dispensing systems, sales from acquisitions and higher tooling sales. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and nearly flat sales of fragrance/cosmetic pumps put downward pressure on our year-over-year sales growth. For the first time, our earnings reflected the adoption of the new accounting standard relating to share-based compensation. Consequently, our quarterly results were reduced by $.13 per share because of non-cash expenses associated with stock options. Aside from the accounting change, our strong earnings in the quarter were driven by increased sales, improved productivity and cost containment efforts. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Beginning with the first quarter of 2006, AptarGroup is reporting new business segments that reflect AptarGroup's realigned internal financial reporting structure. Prior period information has been conformed to the current presentation. Operations that sell spray and lotion dispensing systems to the personal care, fragrance/cosmetic and household markets now form the Beauty & Home segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems to the pharmaceutical market now form the Pharma segment. Finally, operations that sell dispensing closures to each market served by AptarGroup now form the Closures segment. For the quarter, sales of the Beauty & Home segment increased 9% to $195.3 million from $179.1 million in the prior year. Beauty & Home segment income increased to $16.6 million from $14.9 million in the prior year. The increases in Beauty & Home sales and income were primarily due to acquisitions. For the quarter, sales of the Pharma segment increased 6% to $74.6 million from $70.1 million in the prior year. Pharma segment income increased to $17.1 million from $16.3 million a year ago. The growth in the Pharma segment's results was primarily due to increased custom tooling and product sales, partially offset by currency effects. For the quarter, sales of the Closures segment increased 11% to $105.5 million from $94.7 million in the prior year. Closures segment income increased to $10.5 million from $8.3 million a year ago. The Closures segment's results were driven primarily by increased product sales, price increases related to passing through resin costs and acquisitions. OUTLOOK Siebel stated, "We expect sales to continue to increase in the second quarter although sales growth may again be negatively impacted by the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate. We anticipate second quarter sales of our Beauty & Home and Closures segments to grow over the prior year, in spite of ongoing price competition, due to increased volumes as well as the impact of acquisitions. Pharma segment unit volumes are expected to increase although revenue is expected to decline from last year due to lower custom tooling sales and currency effects. We anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 will be in the range of $.70 to $.75 per share, including stock option expenses, compared to $.81 per share in the prior year which included a $.09 per share positive impact from reduced income taxes related to research and development credits in the U.S. and tax law changes in Italy."

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Second Quarter Sales and Operating Income; Increases Dividend and Boosts Shares Authorized for Repurchase CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2006--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record second quarter sales and operating income. The Company's Board of Directors also increased the quarterly dividend by 10% and authorized the repurchase of an additional 2 million shares of common stock. SECOND QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, sales increased 12% to a record $398.6 million from $356.1 million in the prior year. Sales from acquired companies and increased demand for AptarGroup's dispensing systems across all business segments drove sales higher in the quarter. Sales from acquired companies added approximately $25.7 million, or 7%, to AptarGroup's revenue. Movements in currency rates had little effect on the second quarter sales. Operating income, which included a negative impact of $2.1 million related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006, increased to a record $43.8 million, up from $41.1 million a year ago. Net income for the second quarter of 2006, including a $1.4 million negative effect of expensing stock options, was $27.7 million compared to $29.3 million a year ago, which included a positive effect of reduced income taxes of approximately $3.2 million related to research and development credits in the U.S. and tax changes in Italy. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $.77 per share (including the negative effect of $.04 per share related to expensing stock options) compared to $.81 per share in the prior year (including the positive effect of $.09 per share related to the reduced income taxes as described above). Acquisitions contributed approximately $.02 per diluted share to 2006 earnings. SIX MONTHS RESULTS For the six months ended June 30, 2006, sales increased 11% to a record $774.1 million from $700.1 million in the prior year. Changes in exchange rates had a negative impact on sales growth of approximately 2%. Sales improved over the prior year due to recent acquisitions, which added $51.3 million, or 7%, to AptarGroup's revenue, as well as increased product and custom tooling sales. Operating income, which included a negative impact of approximately $9.2 million related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006, increased to a first half record of $76.2 million, up from $75.5 million a year ago. Net income for the first half of 2006, including a $6.0 million negative effect of expensing stock options, was $47.5 million compared to $51.4 million a year ago, which included the positive effect of reduced income taxes of approximately $3.2 million as described above. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.31 per share (including the negative effect of $.17 per share related to expensing stock options) compared to $1.41 per share (including the positive effect of $.09 per share related to the reduced income taxes as described above) in the prior year. For 2006, acquisitions contributed approximately $.04 per diluted share to earnings. MANAGEMENT COMMENT Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report record sales and record operating income for the quarter in spite of the effect of expensing stock options this year. We are seeing positive contributions from the strategic acquisitions we made in the past year and we are pleased that demand for our innovative dispensing systems was strong in the quarter as sales were up over the prior year in each of our segments." Siebel added, "Our Beauty & Home segment sales grew due to acquisitions and increased demand for our fragrance/cosmetic pumps and sampling systems which more than offset soft aerosol valve sales to the U.S. household market. While Pharma segment sales increased over the prior year due to demand for our spray systems and pulmonary devices, profits were negatively affected by higher quality compliance costs. Closures segment sales increased primarily due to acquisitions and the pass-through of raw material cost increases." BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE For the quarter, Beauty & Home segment sales increased 18% to $207.6 million from $175.9 million in the prior year and segment income increased to $19.8 million from $15.6 million in the prior year. For the first half of 2006, Beauty & Home segment sales increased 13% to $402.9 million from $355.0 million in the prior year and segment income increased to $36.4 million from $30.5 million in the prior year. Acquisitions accounted for $20.6 million and $43.2 million of Beauty & Home segment sales growth in the quarter and first six months, respectively. Closures segment quarterly sales increased 8% to $109.4 million from $101.7 million in the prior year and segment income decreased slightly to $12.2 million from $12.3 million a year ago. Closures segment sales for the first half of the year increased 9% to $214.9 million from $196.5 million in the prior year and segment income increased to $22.7 million from $20.6 million a year ago. Acquisitions accounted for $5.1 million and $8.1 million of Closures segment sales growth in the quarter and first half of the year, respectively. Pharma segment quarterly sales increased 4% to $81.5 million from $78.4 million in the prior year and segment income decreased to $19.8 million from $20.3 million a year ago. Pharma segment sales for the first half of the year increased 5% to $156.1 million from $148.5 million in the prior year and segment income increased slightly to $36.9 million from $36.6 million a year ago. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Looking to the third quarter, we believe demand for our dispensing systems across the different markets we serve, will contribute to sales growth over prior year levels in each of our business segments, before considering currency exchange rate movements." Siebel concluded, "While the competitive environment remains challenging, we also face the rising costs of raw materials, transportation, energy, and quality compliance, particularly in the Pharma segment. However, these are not new challenges to us and we will continue to aggressively control costs and as market conditions allow, increase prices to mitigate the adverse effects of the increased cost of doing business. We expect diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006, including the adverse effect of expensing stock options of approximately $.04 per share, to be in the range of $.74 to $.79 per share compared to $.69 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 10% to $.22 per share, payable August 22, 2006 to shareholders of record as of August 1, 2006. The increase brings the annual dividend rate to $.88 per share from $.80 per share. During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 346,000 shares of common stock leaving approximately 700,000 shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the second quarter. The Board today approved the repurchase of an additional 2 million shares. Siebel commented, "Once again, our strong financial position and cash generating ability allows us to return value to shareholders with increased dividends and additional share repurchases. We are pleased that with our strong balance sheet, we can improve shareholder value with such actions and remain well positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they present themselves."

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Third Quarter Results; Expands Presence in South America; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2006--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record third quarter results and announced strategic acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina. The Company's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend. Third Quarter 2006 Highlights -- Set a new quarterly sales record of $404.9 million, up 19% -- Achieved record third quarter EPS of $.80 per share -- Grew each business segment's results over the prior year - sales to the fragrance/cosmetic and personal care markets were particularly strong -- Increased South American footprint with key acquisitions -- Repurchased approximately 426,000 shares THIRD QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, sales increased 19% to a record $404.9 million from $341.1 million in the prior year. Sales, excluding acquisitions and exchange rate effects, grew approximately 8% while sales from acquired companies added approximately $26.5 million, or 8% of growth, and exchange rate movements added another 3%. Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I'm pleased to report that each of our business segments generated sales and profit growth. Our strongest performance came from our Beauty & Home segment with increased demand for our innovative dispensing from the fragrance/cosmetic and personal care markets. Overall Beauty & Home segment sales increased 26%, of which 13% came from acquired companies and 4% came from exchange rate movements. In our Closures segment, demand from the food/beverage market and resin cost-related price adjustments helped increase sales over the prior year. Closures segment sales increased 16%, of which 4% came from acquired companies, with 2% coming from changes in exchange rates. Pharma segment sales increased 6%, with 3% coming from changes in exchange rates and the balance mainly from increased sales of our metered dose valves and custom tooling." Operating income increased to a record $44.6 million, up 15% from $38.7 million a year ago. The 2006 operating income included a negative impact of $2.1 million related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006, and the prior year's results included a negative impact of $3 million related to a previously announced Redeployment Program in France. Beauty & Home segment income increased 48% to $18.5 million primarily due to increased product sales to the fragrance/cosmetic and personal care markets, cost containment efforts and the absence of Redeployment Program charges recorded in the prior year. Closures segment income rose 4% to $11.8 million due to stronger product sales and Pharma segment income increased 7% to $21.7 million due to the positive effects of increased product demand. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $.80 per share compared to $.69 per share in the prior year. Included in 2006 earnings per share is a negative impact of approximately $.04 per share related to stock option expense and included in prior year earnings per share is the negative impact of approximately $.06 per share related to the Redeployment Program. Acquisitions did not have a significant effect on 2006 third quarter earnings per share. Siebel added, "Our product, market and geographic diversity, combined with our continuing innovation and cost containment efforts have once again produced solid returns for our shareholders." YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS For the year-to-date, sales increased 13% to a record $1.2 billion from $1.0 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates had no effect and acquisitions added 7% or $77.8 million to AptarGroup's top line. Operating income increased to a record $120.8 million, up 6% from $114.2 million a year ago. The 2006 operating income included a negative impact of $11.3 million related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006, and the prior year's results included a negative impact of $3 million related to the Redeployment Program mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share equaled the prior year amount of $2.10 per share. Included in the 2006 earnings per share is a negative impact of approximately $.20 per share related to stock option expense. The 2005 earnings per share included a positive impact of approximately $.09 per share related to reduced income taxes recorded in the second quarter of 2005 and the negative impact of approximately $.06 per share related to the Redeployment Program. For 2006, acquisitions contributed approximately $.04 per diluted share to earnings. SOUTH AMERICAN ACQUISITIONS During the third quarter, AptarGroup acquired Augros do Brasil Ltda, a Brazilian injection molder and decorator of aesthetic plastic accessories mainly for the fragrance/cosmetic market, and also acquired the remaining 65% ownership of H. Engelmann S.A.I.C.F. e l., a leading closure supplier in Argentina. The total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $15 million including approximately $13 million in cash and $2 million in assumed debt. Combined annual revenue of the two companies is approximately $17 million. Commenting on the acquisitions, Siebel said, "We have been a minority owner of H. Engelmann for many years and we can now fully leverage their technical abilities and market reputation to support the growing demands of our closure customers in the Mercosur region. Augros' molding and decorative abilities are complementary to our product offerings and will allow us to better serve our fragrance/cosmetic customers in this growing market." OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "We anticipate that sales across each of our business segments will continue to improve over prior year levels in the fourth quarter and AptarGroup will report another strong full-year performance. Despite the continued challenges of rising raw material costs, competitive price pressures and increasing customer quality demands, heading into the fourth quarter we are cautiously optimistic about our future profitability. We expect strong customer demand for our innovative dispensing systems and the positive impact from our recent acquisitions to continue. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter, including the adverse effect of $.04 per share relating to expensing of stock options in 2006, will be in the range of $.67 to $.72 per share compared to $.66 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.22 per share, payable November 22, 2006 to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2006. Also, during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 426,000 shares of common stock leaving approximately 2.2 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.

Siebel, Pfeiffer and Hagge as follows: o Carl Siebel - $760,000 in cash o Peter Pfeiffer - $480,000 in cash o Stephen Hagge - $435,000 total bonus, of which $385,000 was taken in cash and, pursuant to Mr. Hagge's election, $50,000 was taken in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs"). According to a program approved by the Compensation Committee, executive officers electing to receive a portion of their annual bonus in the form of RSUs will receive an additional grant of RSUs equal to 20% of the annual bonus amount taken in the form of RSUs. Mr. Hagge was therefore granted additional RSUs with an approximate value of $10,000. In total, Mr. Hagge was granted 980 RSUs with an approximate value of $60,000 based on the closing share price on the New York Stock Exchange of $61.25 on February 8, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Caps Record Year with Strong Fourth Quarter Results CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 8, 2007--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record fourth quarter and annual results. Highlights -- Fourth quarter sales increase 25% pushing annual sales to record $1.6 billion -- Earnings per share of $.77 for the quarter and $2.87 for the year -- Strong fourth quarter results for the Company's Beauty & Home and Pharma segments -- Over 1 million shares repurchased in the year FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, sales increased 25% to a record $422.4 million from $338.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Increased demand for AptarGroup's innovative dispensing systems and higher custom tooling sales accounted for 14% of the sales growth. Changes in exchange rates represented approximately 7% of the growth while sales from acquired companies contributed 4%. Commenting on the quarter, Carl A. Siebel, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am happy to report that we completed the year with a strong fourth quarter performance, particularly in our Beauty & Home and Pharma segments. Strong demand for our products across each of our business segments, as well as foreign currency effects and contributions from our recent strategic acquisitions, contributed to our sales growth." Fourth Quarter Segment Sales Analysis (Growth Over Prior Year) Beauty & Total Home Closures Pharma AptarGroup ------------------------------------- Product and Custom Tooling Sales 15% 14% 12% 14% Currency Effects 6% 5% 7% 7% Sales from Acquired Companies 6% 5% 0% 4% ------------------------------------- Total Growth 27% 24% 19% 25% ===================================== Siebel added, "Strong product sales drove operating income to a record fourth quarter level of $40.8 million in spite of the negative impact of $2.0 million related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006, as well as a challenging competitive environment and rising material and utility costs. In addition, we experienced operational difficulties in our European Closures business which reduced our Closures segment's income during the quarter and hindered our overall operating income growth." Beauty & Home segment income increased 59% to $17.5 million, Closures segment income decreased 9% to $9.5 million, and Pharma segment income increased 16% to $22.2 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $.77 per share compared to $.66 per share in the prior year. Included in 2006 earnings per share is a negative impact of approximately $.04 per share related to stock option expense and a positive tax benefit of approximately $.03 per share primarily related to tax law changes in Germany. Acquisitions were slightly accretive in the quarter. Additionally, the Company spent $13.3 million to repurchase approximately 223,000 shares of its common stock in the quarter. ANNUAL RESULTS Commenting on AptarGroup's full year performance, Siebel said, "Each of our business segments enjoyed solid sales growth during the year enabling us to achieve our 41st consecutive year of sales growth and report record sales of $1.6 billion, up 16% from $1.4 billion in 2005." Increased product and custom tooling sales accounted for 8% of the Company's sales growth, sales from acquired companies contributed 7%, and changes in exchange rates added 1%. Operating income increased to a record $161.6 million up from $149.8 million a year ago, in spite of the negative impact of a $13.3 million charge related to the expensing of stock options that began in 2006. Strong product sales, improved capacity utilization, and cost containment efforts, including savings from the previously announced Redeployment Program in France that began in 2005, more than offset higher material costs and a challenging competitive price environment. Diluted earnings per share reached a record level of $2.87 per share, up from $2.77 per share a year ago. Included in the 2006 earnings per share is a negative impact of approximately $.24 per share related to stock option expense and the positive impact of the tax benefit mentioned above of approximately $.03 per share (for a net negative impact of $.21 per share). The 2005 earnings per share included a positive impact of approximately $.09 per share related to prior years' research and development tax credits in the U.S. and reduced taxes in Italy, as well as the negative impact of approximately $.07 per share related to the Redeployment Program (for a net positive impact of $.02 per share). Acquisitions were slightly accretive in 2006. Also, the Company spent $57.7 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock in 2006 leaving 2 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Demand for our convenient dispensing systems is expected to improve across each of our business segments in the coming quarter, and given the current foreign currency environment, we anticipate strong sales improvement over the prior year. We are still in an environment of rising material costs but we are committed to mitigating these effects where possible by passing such increases along in our selling prices. The competitive environment also remains challenging. However, we will continue to focus on being the innovation leader in our niche and, as a result, deliver unique value to our customers, and ultimately, to end consumers. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 will be in the range of $.68 to $.73 per share compared to $.55 per share in the prior year."

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter Results; Announces 18% Dividend Increase and 2-for-1 Stock Split; CEO Carl Siebel to Retire at End of Year CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2007--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter results and announced an increased dividend and stock split. President and CEO, Carl Siebel, announced his plans to retire effective December 31, 2007. First Quarter 2007 Highlights -- Earnings per share soar 49% to record high of $.82 per share -- Sales jump 20% to record level of $449.8 million -- Results were strong across all business segments -- Board boosts annual dividend 18% to $1.04 per share -- Stock to be split 2-for-1 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, sales increased 20% to a record $449.8 million from $375.5 million a year ago. Product sales accounted for 12% of the growth while changes in exchange rates contributed 6%, acquisitions added 2%. Commenting on the quarter, Carl Siebel, President and CEO, said, "We had an outstanding quarter with exceptionally strong profit growth and broad-based revenue growth reported by all of our business segments. Sales were up in nearly each geographic region, product category, and end market of our business. Our strategy to focus on the dispensing systems sector of the packaging industry and invest in new companies, new technologies, and new research efforts has put us in position to have such a successful quarter. We are, as we have always been, committed to helping our customers achieve the best possible dispensing solutions for their products and thus grow their own businesses. Our results reflect this commitment and the value our products continually bring to market." First Quarter Segment Sales Analysis (Growth Over Prior Year) Beauty & Total Home Closures Pharma AptarGroup -------------------------------------- Product and Custom Tooling Sales 16% 7% 10% 12% Currency Effects 7% 4% 8% 6% Sales from Acquired Companies 1% 3% 0% 2% -------------------------------------- Total Growth 24% 14% 18% 20% ====================================== Operating income increased to a record $46.6 million, up 44% from $32.4 million a year ago, in spite of stock option expense in the first quarter being approximately $1.6 million higher than the prior year. This is a result of AptarGroup's ongoing cost containment efforts coupled with strong product sales. Beauty & Home segment income increased 57% to $26.1 million driven by increased sales of fragrance/cosmetic pumps and sampling systems, and personal care aerosol valves and accessories. Closures segment income rose 33% to $14.0 million primarily due to stronger sales to the personal care and household markets. Pharma segment income increased 33% to $22.7 million due to strong product sales, particularly sales of metered dose inhaler valves. Diluted earnings per share increased 49% to $.82 per share compared to $.55 per share in the prior year. Siebel added, "Strong demand for our innovative dispensing systems across all of our business segments and our ability to control costs continue to deliver solid earnings growth." OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "The outlook for our second quarter is good at this time. We expect demand for our dispensing systems to continue at a high level and that our overall sales will improve over the prior year excluding any changes in exchange rates. With our continued focus on cost management and our ability to leverage our fixed costs, we expect profits to improve as well. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter will be in the range of $.96 to $1.01 per share on a pre-split basis compared to $.77 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 18% to $.26 per share ($1.04 per share annually on a pre-split basis), payable May 23, 2007 to shareholders of record as of May 2, 2007. Siebel commented, "With our cash generating ability and our strong balance sheet, we are able to return value to shareholders and remain well positioned to take advantage of strategic acquisitions should they present themselves." STOCK SPLIT AptarGroup's Board also approved a 2-for-1 stock split to be effected in the form of a stock distribution to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 2, 2007. AptarGroup currently has approximately 34.6 million common shares outstanding. Each outstanding share of AptarGroup common stock will be split into two shares. Certificates representing additional shares as a result of the stock split will be distributed on or about May 9, 2007. CARL SIEBEL TO RETIRE Carl Siebel has advised the Board of his decision to retire effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Siebel intends to continue to serve as a director of AptarGroup. The Board has selected Peter Pfeiffer, AptarGroup's Vice Chairman since 1993, to succeed Siebel as President and CEO effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the Board announced that the role of Stephen Hagge, Executive Vice President and CFO, will be expanded and his title will include Chief Operating Officer effective January 1, 2008. Siebel commented, "I have worked for the Company for most of my professional career and I am ready to step back from the day-to-day management of the business. However, I look forward to continuing to serve on our Board and playing a part in our future. With the exceptional experience and depth of our senior management team, I am confident that AptarGroup will continue on the same successful course for many years to come. Peter Pfeiffer, my long-term colleague, is an AptarGroup and industry veteran with over 30 years of experience.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports Record Second Quarter Results; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2007--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record second quarter results. The Company's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend. Second Quarter 2007 Highlights -- Earnings per share jumped 33% to a record $.52 per share -- Sales rose 19% to a record $472.9 million -- Solid growth reported across all business segments -- $25 million spent to repurchase 680,000 shares SECOND QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, sales increased 19% to a record $472.9 million from $398.6 million a year ago. Strong dispensing system sales accounted for 12% of the growth while changes in exchange rates contributed 6% and acquisitions added 1%. Commenting on the quarter, Carl Siebel, President and CEO, said, "I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter. All of our business segments reported increased sales and profits. Broad demand for our unique dispensing systems across our different end-markets and geographic areas increased over the prior year. Our commitment to developing the industry's most innovative dispensing solutions continues to drive our growth." Second Quarter Segment Sales Analysis (Growth Over Prior Year) Beauty & Total Home Closures Pharma AptarGroup -------------------------------------- Product and Custom Tooling Sales 14% 5% 18% 12% Currency Effects 6% 4% 6% 6% Sales from Acquired Companies 1% 2% 0% 1% -------------------------------------- Total Growth 21% 11% 24% 19% ====================================== Operating income increased to a record $57.5 million, up 31% from $43.8 million a year ago primarily due to increased dispensing system sales and ongoing cost containment efforts. Increased sales of fragrance/cosmetic pumps and sampling systems, and personal care pumps, aerosol valves, and accessories drove Beauty & Home segment income (income before interest expense net of interest income, stock option and corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) to $26.4 million or an increase of 34%. Closures segment income rose 10% to $13.4 million primarily due to stronger sales to the food and beverage and personal care markets. Strong demand for our metered dose inhaler valves and nasal spray pumps pushed Pharma segment income to $26.4 million or an increase of 33%. Diluted earnings per share increased 33% to a record $.52 per share compared to $.39 per share in the prior year. Siebel added, "We continue to dedicate appropriate resources to the research and development of new dispensing technologies and manage our business with a focus on costs. In addition to these efforts, solid results in each of our business segments drove our earnings to record levels." YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS For the year-to-date, sales increased 19% to a record $922.7 million from $774.1 million a year ago. Dispensing system sales increased 12% while changes in exchange rates added 6% and acquisitions contributed 1% to AptarGroup's top line. Operating income increased to a record $104.1 million, up 37% from $76.2 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 41% to $.93 per share compared to $.66 per share a year ago. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Strong demand across all of our business segments allowed us to achieve record first half results and we have a positive outlook on our third quarter at this time. We anticipate that demand for our dispensing systems will increase over prior year levels and as a result, profits are expected to exceed those recorded a year ago. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the third quarter will be in the range of $.47 to $.50 per share, or an increase of 18% to 25%, compared to $.40 per share in the prior year." CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.13 per share, payable August 21, 2007 to shareholders of record as of July 31, 2007.

After a change in control of AptarGroup, if Mr. Pfeiffer's employment is terminated by AptarGroup or its successor other than for cause, disability or death, or if Mr. Pfeiffer terminates his employment for "good reason," in each case within two years following the change in control, Mr. Pfeiffer is entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to (i) two times his highest annualized salary during the 12 month period preceding the termination and (ii) two times his highest annualized bonus in respect of the three fiscal years of AptarGroup immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the change in control occurs, plus a prorated annual bonus and the continuation of life insurance benefits for two years. In the event that such payments subject Mr. Pfeiffer to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Pfeiffer would generally be entitled to receive a "gross-up" payment to reimburse him for such excise tax. The agreement contains certain noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants prohibiting Mr. Pfeiffer from, among other things, becoming employed by a competitor of AptarGroup for a period of one or two years following termination (depending on the nature of the termination). 2
Because Mr. Pfeiffer is a citizen and principal resident of Germany, certain employment benefits, including medical and life insurance benefits, and retirement benefits have been provided in existing agreements between Mr. Pfeiffer and a German subsidiary of AptarGroup. On October 17, 2007, AptarGroup's German subsidiary entered into a new Employment Agreement and Supplement to the Pension Scheme Arrangement with Mr. Pfeiffer. The new German Employment Agreement, which does not provide for salary in addition to the salary described above, becomes effective on January 1, 2008 and the existing German Employment Agreement terminates on that date. The Supplement to the Pension Scheme Arrangement provides for a one percent increase in Mr. Pfeiffer's pension benefit for each year of employment after age 60 until he attains 65 years of age. The description of the Employment Agreement, the new German Employment Agreement, and the Supplement to the Pension Scheme Arrangement in this Item 5.02 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of these agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, and incorporated herein by reference. On October 17, 2007, in connection with the previously announced retirement of President and Chief Executive Officer Carl Siebel that will be effective December 31, 2007, AptarGroup entered into a one-year Consulting Agreement with Carl Siebel Consulting GmbH, to become effective January 1, 2008 ("Consulting Agreement"). The Consulting Agreement may be extended by AptarGroup for additional one-year terms. Compensation for the consulting services to be provided by Mr. Siebel during the year ending December 31, 2008 will be (euro)165,000 or approximately $234,000 using current exchange rates and will be paid in equal monthly installments. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, which includes a noncompete provision, Carl Siebel Consulting GmbH will be an independent contractor, rather than Mr. Siebel being an employee, of AptarGroup. The description of the Consulting Agreement in this Item 5.02 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Consulting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference. 3

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows: 1. Employment. The Company shall employ the Executive, and the Executive agrees to be employed by the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein for the period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2010, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof; provided, however, that such term shall automatically be extended as of each December 31, commencing December 31, 2008, for one additional year unless either the Company or the Executive shall have terminated this automatic extension provision by written notice to the other party at least 30 days prior to the automatic extension date; and provided further that in no event shall such term extend beyond June 28, 2013. The term of employment in effect from time to time hereunder is hereinafter called the "Employment Period." 2. Position and Duties. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall have the normal duties, responsibilities and authority of an executive serving in such position, subject to the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). The Executive shall have the title of President and Chief Executive Officer and shall report to the Board. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his best efforts and his full business time to the business and affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall remain a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany and shall perform his services pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to the New German Employment Agreement at such locations, and for such periods of time at each location, as the Board shall direct, including, without limitation, at the offices of the Company located in Crystal Lake, Illinois and the offices of the Company's subsidiaries located in St. Germain-en-Laye, France and in Radolfzell, Germany.
3. Compensation and Benefits. (a) In consideration for the performance of the Executive's services to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Executive shall be paid a salary during the Employment Period, in monthly installments, initially at the rate of $750,000 per annum. The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") may, in its sole discretion (i) increase (but not decrease) such salary from time to time and (ii) award a bonus to the Executive for any calendar year during the Employment Period. (b) The Executive shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred by him in the course of performing his duties to the Company and its subsidiaries which are consistent with the Company's policies in effect from time to time. (c) During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's executive benefit programs at the level of Chief Executive Officer, which programs consist of those benefits (including insurance, company car or car allowance and/or other benefits) for which substantially all of the executives of the Company are from time to time generally eligible, as determined from time to time by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in view of the pension benefits provided to the Executive pursuant to the Pension Scheme, the Executive shall not be entitled to participate in the AptarGroup Pension Plan or Supplemental Retirement Plan and (ii) in view of the medical and life insurance coverage provided by the social security system of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Executive shall not be entitled to participate in the medical and life insurance programs sponsored by the Company. The Executive shall be entitled to 30 days of paid vacation per calendar year. Any paid vacation days provided to the Executive pursuant to the New German Employment Agreement shall be credited against the number of paid vacation days provided pursuant to this Section 3(c). (d) In addition to participation in the Company's executive benefit programs pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof, the Executive also shall be entitled to (i) the benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and (ii) the benefits required to be provided to the Executive by any subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the laws applicable to such subsidiary. The Company hereby unconditionally guarantees the payment of all benefits required to be paid by the German Subsidiary to the Executive pursuant to the terms of the Pension Scheme. (e) The Executive's salary and bonus shall be paid to the Executive, the Executive's expenses shall be reimbursed and the Executive's benefits shall be provided (i) by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (ii) by the German Subsidiary, including pursuant to the terms of the New German Employment Agreement, (iii) by another subsidiary of the Company or (iv) by a combination of the foregoing. Such payments, reimbursements and benefits shall be allocated, as determined by the Board, among the Company and its subsidiaries according to the services performed, and the expenses incurred, by the Executive for, or on behalf of, the Company and its subsidiaries. To the extent that any subsidiary of the Company, including, without limitation, the German Subsidiary, pays to the Executive any amount of salary, bonus or other compensation, reimburses the Executive for any expenses or provides the Executive with any benefits, such payment, reimbursement or benefit shall be credited against the Company's obligation to make such payment or reimbursement or provide such benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 2
4. Termination of Employment. (a) The Employment Period shall end upon the first to occur of: (i) the expiration of the term of this Agreement pursuant to Section 1 hereof, (ii) retirement of the Executive ("Retirement"), (iii) termination of the Executive's employment by the Company on account of the Executive's having become unable (as determined by the Board in good faith) to regularly perform his duties hereunder by reason of illness or incapacity for a period of more than six consecutive months ("Termination for Disability"), (iv) termination of the Executive's employment by the Company for Cause ("Termination for Cause"), (v) termination of the executive's employment by the Company other than a Termination for Disability or a Termination for Cause ("Termination Without Cause"), (vi) the Executive's death or (vii) termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive for any reason following written notice to the Company at least 90 days prior to the date of such termination ("Termination by the Executive"). All references in this Agreement to the Executive's termination of employment and to the end of the Employment Period shall mean a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) the commission of a felony involving moral turpitude, (ii) the commission of a fraud, (iii) the commission of any act involving dishonesty with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (iv) gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (v) breach of any provision of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof or (vi) any other breach of this Agreement which is material and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice thereof to the Executive by the Company. (c) If the Employment Period ends for any reason set forth in Section 4(a), except as otherwise provided in this Section 4, the Executive shall cease to have any rights to salary, bonus (if any) or benefits hereunder, other than (i) any unpaid salary accrued through the date of such termination; (ii) any bonus payable, but only if such termination occurs during the third or fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year, such bonus to be prorated in accordance with Company policy; (iii) any unpaid expenses which shall have been incurred as of the date of such termination, which expenses shall be substantiated by the Executive and reimbursed by the Company promptly following such substantiation and in any event by the end of the Executive's taxable year next following his taxable year in which the Executive incurred such expenses; (iv) to the extent provided in any benefit plan in which the Executive has participated, any plan benefits which by their terms extend beyond termination of the Executive's employment; and (v) any payments or benefits to be provided to the Executive by the German Subsidiary, including pursuant to the terms of the New German Employment Agreement, or required to be provided to the Executive by any subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the laws applicable to such subsidiary, following, or in connection with, the termination of the Executive's employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employment Period ends on account of Termination by the Executive other than for Good Reason (as defined in Section 4(i) hereof) pursuant to Section 4(h) hereof or Termination for Cause, the Executive shall not be entitled to any unpaid bonus accrued through the date of such termination. The termination payments and benefits specified by this Section 4 shall be made or provided to the Executive (i) by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (ii) by the German Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the New German Employment Agreement, (iii) by another subsidiary of the Company or (iv) by a combination of the foregoing. Such payments and benefits shall be allocated, as determined by the Board, among the Company and its subsidiaries according to the services performed by the Executive for the Company and its subsidiaries. To the extent that any termination payment or benefit is made or provided to the Executive by a subsidiary of the Company, including, without limitation, the German Subsidiary, including pursuant to the terms of the New German Employment Agreement, such payment or benefit shall be credited against the Company's obligation to make such payment or to provide such benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 3
(d) If the Employment Period ends on account of Retirement, the Executive shall receive no amounts and no benefits other than the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in Section 4(c) hereof. (e) If the Employment Period ends on account of Termination for Disability, in addition to the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in Section 4(c) hereof, the Executive shall receive the disability benefits to which he is entitled under any disability benefit plan in which the Executive has participated as an employee of the Company. (f) If the Employment Period ends on account of the Executive's death, in addition to the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in Section 4(c) hereof, minus any amounts described in clause (v) of the first sentence of Section 4(c) hereof that relate to salary or bonus continuation (including, without limitation, the amounts described in Section 5(3) of the New German Employment Agreement), the Company shall pay to the Executive's estate (or such person or persons as the Executive may designate in a written instrument signed by him and delivered to the Company prior to his death) amounts equal to one-half of the amounts the Executive would have received as salary (based on the Executive's salary then in effect) had the Employment Period remained in effect until the second anniversary of the date of the Executive's death, at the times such amounts would have been paid. (g) If the Employment Period ends on account of Termination without Cause, in addition to the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in Section 4(c) hereof, minus any amounts described in clause (v) of the first sentence of Section 4(c) hereof that relate to salary or bonus continuation, the Company shall, subject to Section 4(l) hereof, pay to the Executive amounts equal to the amounts the Executive would have received as salary (based on the Executive's salary then in effect) had the Employment Period remained in effect until the date on which (without any extension thereof, or, if previously extended, without any further extension thereof) it was then scheduled to end, at the times such amounts would have been paid, less any payments to which the Executive shall be entitled during such salary continuation period under any disability benefit plan in which the Executive has participated as an employee of the Company; provided, however, that in the event of the Executive's death during the salary continuation period, the Company shall pay to the Executive's estate (or such person or persons as the Executive may designate in a written instrument signed by him and delivered to the Company prior to his death) amounts during the remainder of the salary continuation period equal to one-half of the amounts which would have been paid to the Executive but for his death. It is expressly understood that the Company's payment obligations under this Section 4(g) shall cease in the event the Executive shall breach any provision of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof. 4
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Appendix A hereto), the employment of the Executive hereunder shall not be terminated by the Company or any successor to the Company within two years following such Change in Control unless the Executive receives written notice of such termination from the Company or such successor at least 30 days prior to the date of such termination. In the event of such termination of employment by the Company or such successor other than a Termination for Cause, a Termination for Disability or due to the Executive's death (in which case the provisions of Section 4(c), 4(d), 4(e) or 4(f), as the case may be, shall apply), within two years following a Change in Control, or in the event that the Executive terminates his employment hereunder for Good Reason (as defined in Section 4(i) hereof) within two years following a Change in Control: (1) the Company shall, subject to Section 4(l) hereof, pay to the Executive within 30 days following the date of termination, in addition to the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in clauses (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the first sentence of Section 4(c) hereof, minus any amounts described in clause (v) of the first sentence of Section 4(c) hereof that relate to salary or bonus continuation: (A) a cash amount equal to the sum of (i) the Executive's annual bonus in an amount at least equal to the highest annualized (for any fiscal year consisting of less than 12 full months or with respect to which the Executive has been employed by the Company for less than 12 full months) bonus paid or payable, including by reason of any deferral, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the three fiscal years of the Company (or such portion thereof during which the Executive performed services for the Company if the Executive shall have been employed by the Company for less than such three fiscal year period) immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs through the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365 or 366, as applicable, and (ii) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid; plus 5
(B) a lump-sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld) in an amount equal to (i) two (2) times the Executive's highest annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies in effect during the 12-month period prior to the date of termination, plus (ii) two (2) times the Executive's highest annualized (for any fiscal year consisting of less than 12 full months or with respect to which the Executive has been employed by the Company for less than 12 full months) bonus, paid or payable, including by reason of any deferral, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the three fiscal years of the Company (or such portion thereof during which the Executive performed services for the Company if the Executive shall have been employed by the Company for less than such three fiscal year period) immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs; provided, however, that any amount paid pursuant to this Section 4(h)(1)(B) shall be paid in lieu of any other amount of severance relating to salary or bonus continuation to be received by the Executive upon termination of employment of the Executive under any severance plan, policy or arrangement of the Company; (2) for a period of two years commencing on the date of termination, the Company shall continue to keep in full force and effect all policies of life insurance with respect to the Executive and his dependents with the same level of coverage, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as such policies shall have been in effect immediately prior to the date of termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as provided generally with respect to other peer executives of the Company, and the Company and the Executive shall share the costs of the continuation of such insurance coverage in the same proportion as such costs were shared immediately prior to the date of termination; and (3) the Company shall pay to the Executive any compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together with any interest and earnings thereon) in accordance with the terms of the plans pursuant to which such compensation was deferred. In consideration for the payments and benefits set forth in this Section 4(h), the Executive agrees that if a Change in Control shall occur, the Executive shall not terminate his employment hereunder, other than for Good Reason, within one year following such Change in Control unless the Executive provides to the Company or any successor to the Company a written notice of such termination at least six months prior to the date of such termination. (i) For purposes of this Agreement "Good Reason" shall mean (x) a reduction by the Company in the Executive's rate of annual salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, (y) a material reduction in any benefit afforded to the Executive pursuant to any benefit plan of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, unless all comparable executives of the Company suffer a substantially similar reduction or (z) the relocation of the Executive's office to a location more than 60 miles from his current office. 6
(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its affiliated companies to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 4(j) or Appendix B hereto) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive, subject to Section 4(l) hereof, an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(j), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Executive, after taking into account the Payments and the Gross-Up Payment, would not receive a net after-tax benefit of at least $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise Tax) as compared to the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an elimination of the Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payments, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. All procedures relating to the determination and payment of the Gross-Up Payment are set forth in Appendix B hereto. (k) If the Employment Period ends solely on account of the expiration of the term of this Agreement pursuant to Section 1 hereof and not for any other reason set forth in this Section 4, the Executive shall, subject to Section 4(l) hereof, be entitled to receive, in addition to the amounts and benefits provided by the Pension Scheme and the amounts and benefits described in Section 4(c) hereof, minus any amounts described in clause (v) Section 4(c) hereof that relate to salary or bonus continuation, the amounts the Executive would have received as salary (based on the Executive's salary then in effect) at the times such amounts would otherwise have been paid had the Employment Period remained in effect for one year following the date of such termination. It is expressly understood that the Company's payment obligations under this Section 4(k) shall cease in the event the Executive shall breach any provision of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof. (l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the New German Employment Agreement or the Pension Scheme, if on the date that the Employment Period ends, (i) the Company is a publicly traded corporation and (ii) the Company determines that the Executive is a "specified employee," as defined in Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent that any amount payable under this Agreement, the New German Employment Agreement or the Pension Scheme (A) is payable as a result of the separation of the Executive's service, (B) constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and (C) under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Employment Period ends, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier of (1) the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Employment Period ends and (2) the death of the Executive. Notwithstanding the requirement of Section 4(h)(1) hereof that payments to the Executive thereunder be made in a lump sum, if a Change in Control within the meaning of this Agreement does not constitute a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 4(h)(1) hereof shall be paid to the Executive, but with respect to the timing thereof, such payments shall be made in the installments, and during the period, described in Section 4(g) hereof. Each amount payable under this Agreement as a result of the separation of the Executive's service shall constitute a "separately identified amount" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation ss.1.409A-2(b)(2). This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of excise taxes and other penalties under Section 409A of the Code ("409A Penalties"). In the event the terms of this Agreement would subject the Executive to 409A Penalties, the Company and the Executive shall cooperate diligently to amend the terms of this Agreement to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall the Company be responsible for any taxes, penalties, interest or other losses or expenses incurred by the Executive due to any failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 7
5. Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges that the information, observations and data obtained by him while employed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, as well as those obtained by him while employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any predecessor thereof prior to the date of this Agreement, concerning the business or affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any predecessor thereof ("Confidential Information") are the property of the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate. Therefore, the Executive agrees that he shall not disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his own account any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Board unless and except to the extent that such Confidential Information becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of the Executive's acts or omissions to act. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Employment Period, or at any other time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential Information or the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates which he may then possess or have under his control. 6. Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation. (a) The Executive acknowledges that in the course of his employment by the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates pursuant to this Agreement he will become familiar, and during the course of his employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any predecessor thereof prior to the date of this Agreement he has become familiar, with trade secrets and customer lists of and other confidential information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and predecessors thereof and that his services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company. (b) The Executive agrees that during the Employment Period and for one year thereafter in the case of either Termination for Good Reason following a Change in Control or Termination without Cause, or for two years thereafter in the case of termination of employment for any other reason, the ("Noncompetition Period') he shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly, through any person, firm or corporation, alone or as a member of a partnership or as an officer, director, stockholder, investor or employee of or in any other corporation or enterprise or otherwise, engage or be engaged, or assist any other person, firm corporation or enterprise in engaging or being engaged, in any business then actively being conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is conducting such business (whether through manufacturing or production, calling on customers or prospective customers, or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsequent to the Employment Period the Executive may engage or be engaged, or assist any other person, firm, corporation or enterprise in engaging or being engaged, in any business activity which is not competitive with a business activity being conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates at the time subsequent to the Employment Period that the Executive first engages or assists in such business activity. 8
(c) The Executive further agrees that during the Noncompetition Period he shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate or abandon his employment, or any customer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate or abandon its relationship, for any purpose whatsoever, or (ii) in connection with any business to which Section 6(b) applies, call on, service, solicit or otherwise do business with any then current or prospective customer of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. (d) Nothing in this Section 6 shall prohibit the Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation any securities of which are publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. (e) If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 6, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. 7. Enforcement. Because the services of the Executive are unique and the Executive has access to confidential information of the Company, the parties hereto agree that the Company would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof were not performed in accordance with its terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such nonperformance or breach. Therefore, the Company or its successors or assigns shall be entitled, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened breach of any of such provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically (without posting a bond or other security). The Company and the Executive hereby agree that any action or suit relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or any action or suit otherwise relating to or arising out of the Executive's employment by the Company or its subsidiaries, shall be brought in federal or state court located in the State of Illinois. The Company and the Executive hereby specifically submit to the jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the State of Illinois with respect to any action or suit relating to or arising out of this Agreement or otherwise relating to or arising out of the Executive's employment by the Company or its subsidiaries and further agree that service of process may be made within or without the State of Illinois by giving notice in the matter provided in Section 9 hereof. The Company and the Executive waive any right to a trial by jury in any dispute between them. 9
8. Survival. Sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof shall survive and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding any termination of the Employment Period. 9. Notices.

Appendix B to Employment Agreement PROVISIONS RELATING TO ---------------------- GROSS-UP PAYMENT ---------------- (a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraph (b) of this Appendix B, all determinations required to be made under Section 4(j), including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Company's public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to Section 4(j) and this Appendix B shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Paragraph (b) of this Appendix B and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive promptly and in any event by the end of the Executive's taxable year next following his taxable year in which the Executive pays the Excise tax. (b) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall: B-1
(1) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, (2) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company, (3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and (4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph (b), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided further, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and provided further, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. (c) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Paragraph (b) of this Appendix B, the Executive becomes entitled to receive, and receives, any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Paragraph (b)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Paragraph (b) of this Appendix B, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

Exhibit 99.1 AptarGroup Reports All-Time High Quarterly Results; Declares Dividend CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 17, 2007--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported the highest quarterly results in its history. The Company's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $.13 per share. Third Quarter 2007 Highlights -- Earnings per share climbed 40% to a record $.56 per share -- German tax law changes contributed $.03 per share -- Sales rose 20% to a record $485.7 million -- Pharma and Beauty & Home segments were particularly strong -- $19.7 million spent to repurchase 545,000 shares THIRD QUARTER RESULTS For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, sales increased 20% to a record $485.7 million, up from $404.9 million a year ago. Strong dispensing system sales accounted for 13% of the growth while changes in exchange rates contributed 6% and acquisitions added 1%. Commenting on the quarter, Carl Siebel, President and CEO, said, "I'm pleased to report that we had another excellent quarter. Our international presence and dedication to being the innovation leader in our industry enabled us to once again post increased sales and profits across each of our business segments." Third Quarter Segment Sales Analysis (Growth Over Prior Year) Beauty & Total Home Closures Pharma AptarGroup -------------------------------------- Product and Custom Tooling Sales 15% 5% 21% 13% Currency Effects 6% 5% 7% 6% Sales from Acquired Companies 1% 1% 0% 1% -------------------------------------- Total Growth 22% 11% 28% 20% ====================================== Operating income increased to a record $57.4 million, up 29% from $44.6 million a year ago primarily due to the strength of the Pharma and Beauty & Home segments. Beauty & Home segment income (income before interest expense net of interest income, stock option and corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased 38% to $25.6 million driven by demand from the personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets. Strong demand for nasal spray pumps and metered dose inhaler valves drove Pharma segment income to $29.4 million or an increase of 35%. Closures segment income rose 6% to $12.5 million primarily due to stronger sales to the food and beverage market. Diluted earnings per share increased 40% to a record $.56 per share compared to $.40 per share in the prior year. Included in 2007 earnings per share is a positive tax benefit of approximately $.03 per share related to tax law changes in Germany. Siebel added, "Record earnings were driven by strong demand for our innovative products, particularly in our Pharma and Beauty & Home segments where we also realized improved operating performance. Our Closures segment also posted increased profits primarily due to strong demand from the European and Latin American markets. However, Closures' growth was hampered by softer demand from the U.S. personal care market." YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS For the year-to-date, sales increased 19% to a record $1.4 billion from approximately $1.2 billion a year ago. Dispensing system sales increased 12% while changes in exchange rates added 6% and acquisitions contributed 1% to AptarGroup's top line. Operating income increased to a record $161.6 million, up 34% from $120.8 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share, including the $.03 per share positive tax benefit recorded in the third quarter, increased 41% to $1.48 per share compared to $1.05 per share a year ago. OUTLOOK Siebel commented, "Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect each of our business segments to grow over the prior year with notable strength coming from our Pharma and Beauty & Home segments. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $.43 to $.46 per share, or an increase of 13% to 21%, compared to $.38 per share reported a year ago." CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.13 per share, payable November 21, 2007 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2007. Also during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 545,000 shares of common stock for $19.7 million leaving approximately 2.5 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Posts Record Fourth Quarter and Annual Results
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 7, 2008-- AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record fourth quarter and annual results.
Highlights
Fourth quarter sales rose 15% pushing annual sales to an all-time high $1.9 billion
Fourth quarter earnings per share before discontinued operations increased 24% to $.47
Income from discontinued operations accounted for an additional $.03 per share
Sales and profits increased across each business segment
Repurchased 473,000 shares in the quarter and over 2 million shares for the year
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, sales increased 15% to a record $483.8 million from $422.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Continued increased demand for AptarGroups innovative dispensing systems drove sales growth by 6% and changes in exchange rates contributed approximately 9%.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, I am happy to report that our record fourth quarter added to an already exceptional year-to-date performance and we completed the strongest year in the history of our company. Our three business segments, Beauty & Home, Closures, and Pharma, each contributed to our growth despite some softness in the U.S. personal care market. The overall positive fourth quarter performance is noteworthy when we consider that last years results were also quite strong.
Pfeiffer added, While the competitive environment remained challenging, and we continued to face rising material and other costs in the fourth quarter, increased product sales and cost containment efforts allowed operating income to reach a record level of $49.2 million. Beauty & Home segment income increased 22% to $21.4 million, Closures segment income increased 8% to $10.2 million, and Pharma segment income increased 25% to $27.7 million. Also in the quarter, we sold our Australian operation to an Australian-based company. This operation was not significant to our consolidated results. We will continue to serve our customers in this region by selling our products through this company while allowing the new management to grow the business with local support and resources. The gain on this sale, net of tax, was approximately $2.2 million or $.03 per share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $.47 per share compared to $.38 per share in the prior year. Additionally, AptarGroup spent $19.6 million to repurchase approximately 473,000 shares of its common stock in the quarter.
ANNUAL RESULTS
Commenting on AptarGroups full year performance, Pfeiffer said, Each of our business segments enjoyed solid sales growth during the year enabling us to achieve our 42 consecutive year of sales growth. We reported record sales of $1.9 billion, up 18% from $1.6 billion in 2006. Increased product sales accounted for 10% of our sales growth, acquisitions added 1% and changes in exchange rates added 7%. Also, increased profits across each of our business segments drove consolidated operating income to a record $210.7 million up from $161.6 million a year ago. Production efficiencies and cost containment efforts more than offset higher material costs and a challenging competitive price environment.
nd
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 36% to a record level of $1.95 per share, up from $1.43 per share a year ago. AptarGroup spent $76.4 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares of common stock in 2007, leaving approximately 2 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Also during the year, AptarGroup paid $34.4 million in dividends to stockholders, or $.50 per share.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, We are cautiously optimistic about the coming quarter. While there is some uncertainty regarding the economic outlook in the U.S., we are well positioned to withstand slowness in one particular region because of our broad geographic presence and the diverse end-markets that we serve. We expect continuing demand for our convenient dispensing systems will result in sales improvements across each of our business segments in the first quarter of 2008. We are still in a competitive environment and face rising costs, but we are committed to passing these cost increases along in our selling prices where possible. The ongoing dedication by our talented employees and our long-term strategy to be the innovation leader in our field have served us well in the past and should do so in the future. We estimate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 will be in the range of $.46 to $.49 per share compared to $.41 per share in the prior year.

Changes in exchange rates contributed 10% of the growth while product and custom tooling sales accounted for 8%. Two recent acquisitions, discussed below, did not impact the quarterly results.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, I am pleased to report a strong start to the year with a record first quarter. Year-over-year revenue grew at each of our business segments, Beauty & Home, Closures and Pharma. This was particularly encouraging given that we had such a strong performance in the first quarter of last year. Changes in currency exchange rates, increased demand for our creative dispensing solutions, and our broad geographic presence each were contributing factors to our growth.
Pfeiffer added, On a consolidated basis, operating income reached a record $54.7 million, up 17% from $46.6 million a year ago and our operating margin percentage remained equal to the prior year at approximately 10% of sales. Beauty & Home segment income increased 12% to $29.4 million driven by increased sales of fragrance/cosmetic pumps and sampling systems, aerosol valves and specialty accessories. Closures segment income declined 20% to $11.2 million primarily due to softness in demand from the personal care and household markets, which was partially offset by strong demand from the food/beverage market. In addition, in this period of rising resin costs, we experienced the typical lag in the timing of passing through such cost increases in our selling prices. Strong demand for our industry-leading nasal spray systems drove Pharma segment income to a quarterly record high of $29.9 million, an increase of 32%.
Diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $.52 per share compared to $.41 per share in the prior year. Pfeiffer stated, In addition to the operating results previously mentioned, our record earnings were further improved by changes in currency exchange rates, lower tax rates, and lower net interest expense.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Our outlook for the coming quarter is positive. Though some uncertainty about the near-term performance of the U.S. economy remains, we expect demand for our innovative dispensing systems to grow and that sales will increase over the prior year. We will continue to mitigate the rising cost of doing business by increasing our selling prices where possible. Currently, we estimate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter will be in the range of $.60 to $.63 per share compared to $.52 per share in the prior year.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.13 per share, payable May 21, 2008 to shareholders of record as of April 30, 2008. Also during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 450,000 shares of common stock for $16.6 million leaving approximately 1.5 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the first quarter.
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
In the quarter, AptarGroup acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of Next Breath LLC, a contract service organization located in Baltimore, Maryland, specializing in analytical testing of nasal and inhalation products on behalf of pharmaceutical, biotech, drug delivery and device companies, for a purchase price of approximately $4 million. Next Breath is a good complement to AptarGroups existing Pharma segment businesses and it will provide expertise that will help enhance the performance of our innovative systems. AptarGroup also previously announced that it had acquired the equipment, inventory and intellectual property of CCL Industries Inc.s Bag-on-Valve business for a purchase price in cash of approximately $9 million. CCLs Bag-on-Valve business had revenues of approximately $9 million in 2007 and will be part of AptarGroups Beauty & Home segment.
Commenting on the acquisitions, Pfeiffer said, These are both strategic moves for us. Next Breath, which is a relatively young operation, is providing unique laboratory services for the Pharma market. The Bag-on-Valve asset acquisition provides us with additional capacity in this important niche of our Beauty & Home segment and with new Bag-on-Valve customers.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement ------------------------------------------ 2008 AptarGroup Director Stock Option Plan At the annual meeting of stockholders of AptarGroup, Inc. ("AptarGroup") held on April 30, 2008 (the "Annual Meeting"), AptarGroup's stockholders approved AptarGroup's 2008 Director Stock Option Plan (the "2008 Director Stock Option Plan"), which had been previously approved by the AptarGroup's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors"), subject to stockholder approval. The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal terms of the 2008 Director Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Director Stock Option Plan is set forth in its entirety as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The 2008 Director Stock Option Plan provides for grants of stock options to non-employee directors in order to provide an incentive for non-employee directors to maximize the long-term value of AptarGroup's common stock and to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors. The plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee"). The Compensation Committee will not have the authority to reprice any stock option granted under the plan. All non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the plan. Under the plan, the aggregate number of shares subject to options cannot exceed 500,000 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event. If an option expires or is cancelled, terminated or forfeited without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to that option will again be available under the plan. The exercise price per share under each option will not be less than the closing price of common stock on the grant date (or, if the grant date is not a trading date, on the next preceding date which was a trading date) on the New York Stock Exchange. Participants may not transfer options other than (1) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by us or (2) as otherwise permitted in the option agreement. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, each option may be exercised during a participant's lifetime only by the participant or the participant's representative or similar person. The Board of Directors may amend the plan by a resolution adopted by at least 70% of the members of the Board of Directors, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation. No amendment may impair the rights of a holder of an outstanding option without the consent of the holder.

The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal terms of the Annual Bonus Plan. The Bonus Plan is set forth in its entirety as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. 2
Under the Bonus Plan, payment of awards to participating employees is subject to the attainment of specific performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for a specified period, and other terms and conditions that may be established by the Compensation Committee. Upon attainment of the relevant performance goals, a participant will be eligible to receive an award in cash or restricted stock units, or any combination of both. Performance goal targets will be expressed in terms of an objective formula or standard which may be based on an employee's base salary, or a multiple thereof, at the time or immediately before the performance goals for such period were established. In all cases, the Compensation Committee has the sole and absolute discretion to reduce the amount of any payment under the Bonus Plan that would otherwise be made to any participant or to decide that no payment shall be made. No participant will receive a payment under the Bonus Plan with respect to any period having a value in excess of $2,000,000. 2008 AptarGroup Stock Option Plan At the Annual Meeting, AptarGroup's stockholders approved AptarGroup's 2008 Stock Option Plan (the "2008 Stock Option Plan"), which had been previously approved by the Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval. The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal terms of the 2008 Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Stock Option Plan is set forth in its entirety as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The 2008 Stock Option Plan provides for grants of stock options to employees of AptarGroup in order to attract, retain, motivate, provide competitive incentive compensation and further the identity of interests of participants with those of AptarGroup's stockholders. The 2008 Stock Option Plan permits AptarGroup to grant stock options to employees of AptarGroup and its subsidiaries and other entities in which AptarGroup has a direct or indirect equity interest. Stock options may be either "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or other options. The plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Committee will not have authority to reprice any stock option granted under the plan. Other than stock options, no other type of award may be granted under the plan. The Compensation Committee may award a maximum of 3,800,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the plan, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event. If stock options expire unexercised or are cancelled, terminated or forfeited without the issuance of shares, such shares will again be available under the plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock subject to options granted during any calendar year to any person will be 500,000, subject to the adjustments described above. Each option will be exercisable at such time or times as the Compensation Committee determines at or subsequent to the grant; provided that no option shall be exercisable later than 10 years after the date of the grant. Stock options will not be transferable other than (1) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by AptarGroup or (2) as otherwise permitted as set forth in the agreement relating to such grant. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, each stock option may be exercised during a participant's lifetime only by the participant or the participant's legal representative or similar person. 3
The Board of Directors may amend the plan at any time by a resolution adopted by at least 70% of the members of the Board of Directors, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. No amendment may impair the rights of the holder of any outstanding stock option without his or her consent.

In the case of earnings-based measures, in addition to the ratios specifically enumerated above, performance goals may include comparisons relating to capital (including, but not limited to, the cost of capital), shareholders' equity, shares outstanding, assets or net assets, or any combination thereof. With respect to Participants who are not "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and who, in the Committee's judgment, are not likely to be a covered employees at any time during the applicable Performance Period, the performance goals established for the Performance Period may consist of any objective corporate-wide or subsidiary, division, operating unit or individual measures, whether or not listed herein. Performance goals shall be subject to such other special rules and conditions as the Committee may establish at any time within the Applicable Period. 4.2.

At the time performance goals are established for a Performance Period, the Committee also shall establish an Individual Award Opportunity for each Participant or group of Participants, which shall be based on the achievement of one or more specified targets of performance goals. The targets shall be expressed in terms of an objective formula or standard which may be based upon the Participant's Annual Base Salary or a multiple thereof. In all cases the Committee shall have the sole and absolute discretion to reduce the amount of any payment with respect to any Individual Award Opportunity that would otherwise be made to any Participant or to decide that no payment shall be made. No Participant shall receive a payment, whether in cash or in Restricted Stock Units, under the Plan with respect to any Performance Period having a value in excess of $2,000,000, which maximum amount shall be prorated with respect to Performance Periods that are less than one year in duration. 10.2-3
5.2. Payments. Payments with respect to Individual Award Opportunities shall be made in cash or in Restricted Stock Units, or partly in cash and partly in Restricted Stock Units, and shall be made at the time determined by the Committee after the end of the Performance Period for which the awards are payable, provided that (a) no such payment shall be made unless and until the Committee has certified in writing the extent to which the applicable performance goals for such Performance Period have been satisfied and (b) no such payment shall be made later than March 15 of the year immediately following the last day of the applicable Performance Period. VI. General 6.1. Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders and, if approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting, shall become effective for Performance Periods beginning on and after January 1, 2008. The Plan shall terminate as of December 31, 2012, unless terminated earlier by the Board. In the event that the Plan is not approved by the stockholders of the Company, the Plan shall be null and void with respect to Participants who are "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 6.2. Amendments. The Board may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including Section 162(m) of the Code. 6.3. Non-Transferability of Awards. No award under the Plan shall be transferable other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Company. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, no award may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any such award, such award and all rights thereunder shall immediately become null and void. 6.4. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to require, prior to the payment of any amount pursuant to an award made hereunder, payment by the Participant of any Federal, state, local or other taxes which may be required to be withheld or paid in connection with such award. 6.5. No Right of Participation or Employment. No person shall have any right to participate in the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any award made hereunder shall confer upon any person any right to continued employment by the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or affect in any manner the right of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company to terminate the employment of any person at any time without liability hereunder. 6.6. Designation of Beneficiary. If permitted by the Company, a Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of one or more persons as such Participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries (both primary and contingent) in the event of the Participant's death. Each beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime on a form prescribed by the Committee. The spouse of a married Participant domiciled in a community property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of a beneficiary other than such spouse. The filing with the Committee of a new beneficiary designation shall cancel all previously filed beneficiary designations. 10.2-4
If a Participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if all designated beneficiaries of a Participant predecease the Participant, then each outstanding award shall be payable to the Participant's executor, administrator, legal representative or similar person. 6.7. Governing Law. The Plan and each award hereunder, and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and construed in accordance therewith without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. 6.8. Other Plans. Payments pursuant to the Plan shall not be treated as compensation for purposes of any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, unless either (a) such other plan provides that compensation such as payments made pursuant to the Plan are to be considered as compensation thereunder or (b) the Board or the Committee so determines in writing. Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the Company's stockholders for their approval shall be construed as limiting the power of the Board or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may otherwise deem appropriate. 6.9. Binding Effect. The Plan shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and the Participants and their beneficiaries, personal representatives and heirs. If the Company becomes a party to any merger, consolidation or reorganization, then the Plan shall remain in full force and effect as an obligation of the Company or its successors in interest, unless the Plan is amended or terminated pursuant to Section 6.2. As adopted by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2008. 10.2-5

(d) An option may be exercised (1) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of whole shares of Common Stock to be purchased and accompanied by payment therefor in full (or arrangement made for such payment to the Company's satisfaction) either (A) in cash, (B) in cash delivered by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom the optionee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise, (C) by delivery of previously owned whole shares of Common Stock (for which the optionee has good title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having a Market Value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the aggregate purchase price payable by reason of such exercise, or (D) a combination of (A) and (C), in each case to the extent set forth in the agreement relating to the option and (2) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request.

6. Miscellaneous Provisions. (a) Nontransferability. No option shall be transferable other than (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Company or (ii) as otherwise permitted as set forth in the agreement relating to such option. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, each option may be exercised during the participant's lifetime only by the participant or the participant's legal representative or similar person. Except as permitted by the second preceding sentence, no option shall be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to so sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any option, such option and all rights thereunder shall immediately become null and void. (b) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than a cash dividend, the number and class of securities available under the Plan, the maximum number of shares available for grants of options to any person, the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding option and the purchase price per security shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, such adjustments to be made in the case of outstanding options without an increase in the aggregate purchase price; provided, however, that in the event of a cash dividend, other than a regular cash dividend, the Committee shall have the discretion to make any or all of the foregoing adjustments. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive. If any such adjustment would result in a fractional security being (i) available under the Plan, such fractional security shall be disregarded, or (ii) subject to an option, the Company shall pay the holder of such option, in connection with the first exercise of such option in whole or in part after such adjustment, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (1) the fraction of such security (rounded to the nearest hundredth) by (2) the excess, if any, of (A) the Market Value on the exercise date over (B) the exercise price of such option. (c) Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to require, prior to the issuance or delivery of any shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option, payment by the holder of such option of any Federal, state, local or other taxes which may be required to be withheld or paid in connection with the exercise of such option. An agreement relating to an option may provide that (1) the Company shall withhold cash or whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered upon exercise of the option having, in the case of Common Stock, an aggregate Market Value determined as of the date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes arises in connection with the exercise of such option (the "Tax Date") in the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation or (2) the holder of the option may satisfy any such obligation by any of the following means: (A) a cash payment to the Company, (B) a cash payment by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom the optionee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise, (C) delivery to the Company of previously owned whole shares of Common Stock (for which the holder has good title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having an aggregate Market Value determined as of the Tax Date, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (D) authorizing the Company to withhold whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered upon exercise of the option having an aggregate Market Value determined as of the Tax Date, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (E) any combination of (A) and (C), in each case to the extent set forth in the agreement relating to the option; provided, however, that the Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to clauses (B) through (E), except that the Committee may not disapprove of an election made by a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Shares of Common Stock to be delivered or withheld may not have an aggregate Market Value in excess of the minimum amount required to be withheld. Any fraction of a share of Common Stock which would be required to satisfy such an obligation shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due shall be paid in cash by the holder. 10.3-3
(d) Listing and Legal Compliance. The Committee may suspend the exercise or payment of any award if it determines that securities exchange listing or registration or qualification under any securities laws is required in connection therewith and has not been completed on terms acceptable to the Committee (e) Beneficiary Designation. To the extent permitted by the Company, participants may name, from time to time, beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom benefits under the Plan are to be paid in the event of their death before they receive any or all of such benefits. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the participant in writing with the Company during the participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at a participant's death shall be paid to the participant's estate. (f) Rights of Participants. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate any participant's employment at any time, nor confer upon any participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate for any period of time or to continue his or her present or any other rate of compensation. No employee shall have a right to be selected as a participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a participant. (g) Amendment. The Board of Directors, through a resolution adopted by directors constituting at least seventy percent (70%) of the whole Board of Directors, may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including Section 162(m) of the Code. No amendment may impair the rights of a holder of an outstanding option without the consent of such holder. 7. Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval and, if approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of stockholders, shall become effective on the date of such approval. In the event that the Plan is not approved by the stockholders of the Company, the Plan and any outstanding options shall be null and void. The Plan shall terminate ten years after its effective date, unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors through a resolution adopted by directors constituting at least seventy percent (70%) of the whole Board of Directors. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the terms or conditions of any award granted prior to termination. As adopted by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2008 10.3-4

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record Second Quarter Results;
Raises Dividend and Increases Shares Authorized for Repurchase
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 17, 2008--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record second quarter results. The Companys Board of Directors also increased the quarterly dividend by 15% and authorized the repurchase of an additional 4 million shares of common stock.
Second Quarter 2008 Highlights
Earnings per share increased 23% to a record $.64 per share
Sales rose 17% to a record $551.3 million
Pharma segment achieved record results
$20.3 million spent to repurchase 460,000 shares
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, sales increased 17% to a record $551.3 million from $472.9 million a year ago. Dispensing system sales accounted for 6% of the growth while changes in exchange rates contributed 11%. Contributions from acquisitions were not significant in the quarter.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, Im pleased to report another record quarter. We benefited from changes in currency exchange rates and the broad diversification of our business. The quarter started strongly but we saw some softness toward the end of the quarter particularly in the personal care, fragrance/cosmetic and household markets. This softness was offset by increased demand from the pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets.
Pfeiffer commented, Operating income increased to a record $65.2 million, up 13% from $57.5 million a year ago primarily due to the strong performance of the Pharma segment. Pharma segment income grew 33% to $35.0 million on strong demand for all product categories. Beauty & Home segment income rose to $26.8 million or an increase of 2% while Closures segment income declined 4% to $12.8 million. Our Beauty & Home and Closures segments were affected by slowing sales toward the end of the quarter and margins were negatively affected by the continual rise in raw material and transport costs particularly in the U.S. We are increasing our prices as market conditions permit in order to mitigate this cost inflation but there is a normal delay in this process.
Diluted earnings per share increased 23% due primarily to operating performance, higher interest income, lower effective tax rate, and foreign currency effects, to a record $.64 per share compared to $.52 per share in the prior year.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, We have completed a record first half of the year in what many considered a difficult economic environment, especially in the U.S. We also finished the first six months well ahead of our exceptional 2007 results.
For the year-to-date, sales increased 17% to a record $1.1 billion from $922.7 million a year ago. Dispensing system sales increased 7% while changes in exchange rates added 10%. Operating income increased to a record $120.0 million, up 15% from $104.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.16 per share compared to $.93 per share a year ago.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer added, As we look at the third quarter, we expect challenging economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in light of continuing rising input costs. Increased demand from the pharmaceutical and food/beverage markets, and the developing regions of the world, is expected to contribute to our growth over the prior year. Last year we reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $.56 per share that included a positive impact of $.03 per share related to a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities stemming from a change in the German tax law. Excluding this deferred tax adjustment, diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of last year were $.53 per share. At this time, we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of this year will be in the range of $.55 to $.58 per share.
CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 15% to $.15 per share, payable August 20, 2008 to shareholders of record as of July 30, 2008. The increase brings the annual dividend rate to $.60 per share up from $.52 per share.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 460,000 shares of common stock for approximately $20.3 million leaving approximately 1.1 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the second quarter. The Board today approved the repurchase of an additional 4 million shares.
Pfeiffer commented, We continue to generate strong cash flow and our financial position allows us to return value to shareholders with increased dividends and additional share repurchases. While we are in terrific position to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they present themselves, our strong balance sheet also allows the Board to take these actions that improve shareholder value.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record Results Driven by Strong Pharma Business;
Declares Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 15, 2008--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record third quarter results mainly due to the strength of the Companys Pharma segment. AptarGroups Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share.
Third Quarter 2008 Summary
Earnings per share rose to record of $.57 per share
Sales increased 10% to $532.2 million
Pharma segment continued strong performance
Challenging economic environment pressured results of Beauty & Home and Closures segments
Strong balance sheet maintained in a tightening credit market
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, sales increased 10% to $532.2 million, up from $485.7 million a year ago. Changes in exchange rates accounted for 7% of the growth while product sales contributed 3%.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, In spite of the challenging economic environment, we reported another quarter of record sales and profits. This underscores the strength of our business model; one that offers a broad range of innovative dispensing systems to a diverse group of industries throughout many geographic regions.
Operating income increased to $59.2 million, up 3% from $57.4 million a year ago primarily due to the strength of the Pharma segment. Pharma segment income (income before interest expense net of interest income, stock option and corporate expenses, income taxes and unusual items) increased 17% to $34.4 million driven by increased demand for the Companys metered dose inhaler valves and nasal pumps. Beauty & Home segment income declined 15% to $21.7 million primarily due to under absorbed overhead associated with sluggish demand from the personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets and rising global input costs. Closures segment income was approximately equal to the prior years level reflecting the softness in the personal care and household markets in Europe and rising global input costs.
In 2007, the Company reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $.56 per share that included a positive impact of $.03 per share related to a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities stemming from a change in the German tax law. Excluding this deferred tax adjustment, diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2007 were $.53 per share. For the third quarter of 2008, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $.57 per share. Pfeiffer added, This was a challenging quarter considering the weakening overall business environment particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Our Beauty & Home and Closures operations experienced underutilized capacity that was caused by softer demand and, at the same time, had to face rising costs. However, our business is well balanced between different segments, end markets, and global regions. The strong performance of our Pharma segment and lower net interest expense drove our earnings growth.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
For the year-to-date, sales increased 15% to $1.6 billion from approximately $1.4 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates accounted for 9% of the increase while product sales contributed 6%.
Operating income increased to $179.1 million, up 11% from $161.6 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.48 per share a year ago (which included the $.03 per share positive tax benefit recorded in the third quarter 2007).
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Global economic uncertainties are clouding the visibility we have on the fourth quarter. Retailers are reporting that consumers are reining in spending in light of these uncertainties and, as a result, some of our customers in the Beauty & Home and Closures segments are becoming more cautious and delaying orders so that they can reduce their inventory levels. It is difficult for us to predict how long this situation will last and how it will affect our near-term results. However, what is clear is that we have managed harsh global economic conditions in the past with the same strategy, the same determination, and the same diverse portfolio of businesses that we have right now. Our broad geographic presence enables us to benefit from growth in emerging areas while providing an insulating balance against softness in any one particular region. We remain committed to being the innovative leader in our field and, with our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in research and development and take advantage of acquisition opportunities in spite of any tightness in the credit market. Nevertheless, we expect the fourth quarter to be challenging and we are looking at ways to reduce our cost structure, where possible, to offset any underutilized capacity. At this time we anticipate that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $.42 to $.47 per share, compared to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $.47 per share reported a year ago.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable November 19, 2008 to shareholders of record as of October 29, 2008. Also during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of common stock for $20.7 million leaving approximately 4.5 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Fourth Quarter Results;
Achieves Record Annual Revenue and Earnings Per Share
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 5, 2009--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported fourth quarter and annual results.
Fourth Quarter 2008 Summary
Sales rose 2% excluding currency effects
Changes in exchange rates reduced reported sales by 8%
Pharma segment strength offset weakness in Beauty & Home and Closures segments
Earnings per share from continuing operations were $.46 compared to $.47 a year ago
Balance sheet remained in strong condition
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, reported sales decreased 6% to $455.9 million from $483.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to the negative effects of a stronger dollar relative to other currencies. When currency effects are excluded, sales increased 2% over the prior year.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, Clearly, these are challenging times and our sales growth in certain markets was hampered by the global economic crisis. Also, the dollar gained ground on other currencies compared to a year ago and this had a negative effect on our translated results. Demand for our Beauty & Home dispensing systems from the personal care market was stable but we experienced declining volumes in the fragrance/cosmetic and household markets. Increased sales by our Closures segment to the food/beverage and personal care markets were offset by a decline in sales to the household market. Finally, our Pharma segment continued to deliver another strong performance as demand for our industry-leading metered dose inhaler valves and nasal spray pumps increased.
Pfeiffer added, Declining sales in our Beauty & Home and Closures segments led to underutilized capacity. While we took actions to reduce costs, we could not completely offset the negative volume effects. Beauty & Home segment income decreased 36% to $13.6 million and Closures segment income decreased 15% to $8.7 million. Pharma segment income of $27.8 million was only slightly above the prior years level primarily due to sales mix and the negative effects of currency exchange rates. Further, due to lower resin costs at the end of the year, our LIFO inventory reserve decreased and this had a positive impact on our corporate expenses. Overall, we were able to achieve operating income of $49.3 million which was a slight increase over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $.46 per share compared to $.47 per share in the prior year. Discontinued operations in last years fourth quarter accounted for $.03 per share related to a gain on the sale of our Australian operations.
ANNUAL RESULTS
Commenting on AptarGroups full year performance, Pfeiffer said, The year 2008 was a year of two very different halves. We began the year coming off of 2007s record performance which was the strongest in the history of our company and 2008s first half results continued to be excellent. However, in the third quarter, with the onset of the financial crisis, we began to see slowdowns in certain markets. In spite of the weakness in the second half, we achieved our 43 consecutive year of sales growth. We reported record sales of nearly $2.1 billion, up 9% from $1.9 billion in 2007. Increased product sales accounted for 5% of our sales growth and changes in exchange rates added 4%. Also, the strength of our Pharma segment helped offset profit declines at our other two segments and consolidated operating income rose 8% to a record $228.4 million up from $210.7 million a year ago. This was in spite of rising input costs that occurred throughout most of the year.
rd
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 12% to a record level of $2.18 per share, up from $1.95 per share a year ago. AptarGroup spent $57.6 million to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock in 2008, leaving approximately 4.5 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Also during the year, AptarGroup paid $38.0 million in dividends to stockholders, or $.56 per share.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Our visibility, which had already begun to diminish toward the end of 2008, remains very limited at this time. Preliminary first quarter indications point toward continuing softness in our Beauty & Home and Closures segments. Our customers in these segments are cautious in response to contracting consumer spending and they are reducing inventories and delaying certain product launches until the horizon becomes clearer. We are intensifying our review of our own operations and making adjustments where necessary. At the same time, we remain committed to being the innovative leader and we will maintain the flexibility needed to help our customers when their businesses bounce back. However, we anticipate that underutilized capacity will continue to have a negative effect on our results in the coming quarter. Our Pharma segment should perform at or above prior year levels, excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Exchange rates are expected to be quite different than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2008, when the average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro was 1.50 and it is approximately 1.30 today, a 13% strengthening of the dollar.
We currently estimate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 will be in the range of $.35 to $.40 per share compared to $.52 per share in the prior year. Looking beyond the first quarter, we are confident that the diversity of our business model, along with our strong balance sheet and experienced management team, will enable us to emerge from this tenuous period and continue our long-term growth.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup, Inc. Reports First Quarter Results;
Announces Facility Consolidation Plan;
Declares Quarterly Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 15, 2009--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported first quarter results and announced a plan to consolidate several facilities. Also, the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share.
First Quarter 2009 Summary
Sales volumes declined on general economic weakness
Reported results were adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates
Underutilized capacity negatively impacted Beauty & Home segment income
Profit margins improved in Pharma and Closures segments
Facility consolidation plan announced
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, sales decreased 19% to $431.8 million from $532.3 million a year ago. Product and custom tooling sales declined 10%, changes in exchange rates accounted for an additional 10% decline and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, The challenging business conditions that we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year continued through the first quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates also had a negative impact on our results compared to the prior year.
Pfeiffer added, Our Beauty & Home segment sales declined mainly due to a drop in demand from the fragrance/cosmetic market. Decreased sales to the personal care market in the Closures segment was partially offset by increased sales to the food/beverage market. Also, both the Beauty & Home and Closures segments experienced some increased price pressure. Our Pharma segment sales were stable and nearly equal to the prior year excluding currency effects.
On a consolidated basis, operating income declined 28% to $39.3 million, down from $54.7 million a year ago. Though we benefited from multiple cost reductions, the effects of the sales downturn were significant and we could not offset the resulting underutilized capacity in our Beauty & Home segment. Beauty & Home segment income declined 64% to $10.3 million. Despite decreased overall sales, Closures segment income increased 8% to $11.6 million primarily due to cost savings and the normal delay in the pass-through of lower resin costs. Pharma segment income declined 4% to $28.4 million due to currency effects.
Diluted earnings per share decreased 27% to $.38 per share compared to $.52 per share in the prior year.
FACILITY CONSOLIDATION
The Company today announced a plan to consolidate two French dispensing closure manufacturing facilities and several sales offices in North America and Europe. The locations affected are part of AptarGroups Closures and Beauty & Home segments. The total costs associated with the consolidation plan are estimated to be approximately $6 million. The charges will be recorded in the quarter in which they are recognizable for accounting purposes with the majority expected in 2009. Annual savings are estimated to be approximately $3 million primarily beginning in 2010.
Commenting on the consolidation plan, Peter Pfeiffer stated, These actions will better align our manufacturing activities with our customers needs and allow us to more cost-effectively manage our sales operations. These steps are in addition to our traditional cost containment efforts. We are streamlining our structure without sacrificing our ability to respond quickly to market demands.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Looking forward, our visibility continues to be very limited. Presently we expect that the conditions we experienced in the first quarter will continue into the second quarter. Excluding any effects of the facility consolidation plan, we expect diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2009 to be in the range of $.37 to $.42 per share compared to $.64 per share in the prior year.
Difficult economic conditions have historically presented opportunities as well as challenges. The present situation, severe as it may be, is no different. While future sales visibility remains low, presently we expect that demand, particularly in our Beauty & Home and Closures segments, will increase in the second half of the year. While we have been reducing costs, we have not reduced our research and development efforts. We believe that our strong balance sheet, experienced management team and dedicated employees will enable us to weather the current economic situation and that when conditions improve, our innovative new products will drive market share growth.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Second Quarter Results;
Declares Quarterly Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 16, 2009--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported second quarter results and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share.
Second Quarter 2009 Summary
All segments remained profitable despite weak economic conditions
Year-to-year sales declined 20% on an absolute basis but declined only 11% excluding changes in currency rates
Operating income declined 28%, including a $3.1 million charge for facilities consolidation and other severance costs
Cost saving efforts contributed to a sequential improvement in operating margin percentage
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, sales decreased 20% to $440.5 million from $551.3 million a year ago. Product and custom tooling sales declined 11% and changes in exchange rates accounted for the remaining 9% decline.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, All segments continued to navigate well through a very difficult business environment. Each of our business segments had profitable quarters, retained their market shares, successfully executed a variety of cost savings initiatives and continued to invest in new product development.
Pfeiffer added, Our Beauty & Home segment continued to be the most impacted by economic conditions, especially in developed markets. Sales to the fragrance/cosmetic market dropped significantly and this explains the majority of the segments 17% year-to-year decline in sales excluding currency effects. Beauty & Home segment income declined 58% to $11.1 million, including approximately $.3 million of expense related to the facilities consolidation and severance (consolidation/severance) programs, compared to the prior year primarily due to underutilized capacity.
The Closures segments sales decline of 8%, excluding currency effects, primarily reflects the pass-through of resin cost decreases. Excluding the impact of exchange rate changes, a decline in sales to the personal care market was offset by strong sales to the food/beverage market. Closures segment income increased 10% to $13.7 million despite a $2.8 million charge relating to consolidation/severance expenses. A variety of cost saving programs is having a noticeable effect in this segment.
Pfeiffer continued, Our Pharma segments sales, excluding currency effects, were down 2% from the prior year. Pharma segment income declined 12% to $31.3 million primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates.
On a consolidated basis, operating income declined 28% to $48.0 million (including approximately $3.1 million of consolidation/severance expenses), down from $66.6 million a year ago.
Reported diluted earnings per share, which include the consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 36% to $.41 per share. Diluted earnings per share, excluding consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 31% to $.44 compared to $.64 per share in the prior year.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Year-to-date sales decreased 19% to $872.3 million from approximately $1.1 billion a year ago. Product and custom tooling sales declined 11%, changes in exchange rates accounted for 9% of the decrease and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales.
Operating income decreased 28% to $88.5 million (including approximately $3.1 million of consolidation/severance expenses) down from $122.6 million a year ago. Reported diluted earnings per share, which include the consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 32% to $.79 per share. Diluted earnings per share, excluding consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 29% to $.82 compared to $1.16 per share in the prior year.
FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION AND SEVERANCE PROGRAMS
The Company had previously announced a plan to consolidate two French dispensing closure manufacturing facilities and several sales offices in North America and Europe and has subsequently expanded the program to include additional headcount reductions. The total costs associated with the consolidation/severance programs are estimated to be approximately $7 million, of which $3.1 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to be recorded as incurred over the next two quarters. Annual savings are estimated to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million primarily beginning in 2010.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer added, While we are encouraged that late second quarter activity seems to indicate that things may be stabilizing in some of the hardest hit markets, visibility remains very low and uncertainty remains. We also believe that the road out from the bottom of these markets will not be a rapid ascent, but rather a prolonged, gradual journey. Our customers know in these stressful times they can count on stable partners like AptarGroup and we will continue to offer outstanding service and the industrys best dispensing systems. We will continue to diligently control costs and maintain our strong balance sheet while generating fresh new ideas through research and development. Excluding facilities consolidation and severance program charges, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $.44 to $.49 per share compared to $.57 per share in the prior year.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable August 19, 2009 to shareholders of record as of July 29, 2009.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 108,000 shares of common stock for approximately $3.4 million leaving approximately 4.3 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the second quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Third Quarter Results;
Expands Presence in South America;
Declares Quarterly Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 14, 2009--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported third quarter results, announced the completion of an acquisition in South America, and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share.
Third Quarter 2009 Summary
Consolidated sales decreased 11% from the prior year level and decreased 7% excluding currency effects and acquisitions
Operating income reached $52.9 million despite challenging conditions, a decline of 12% from the prior year, of which 4% was due to a charge of $2.6 million for the previously announced facilities consolidation and severance program
Certain regions and markets stabilized in the third quarter leading to improved sales and profits over the second quarter
South American acquisition was completed
Strong balance sheet was maintained
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, sales decreased 11% to $473.7 million from $532.2 million a year ago. Product and custom tooling sales declined 7%, changes in exchange rates accounted for 5% of the decline and acquisitions added 1% to sales.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, Despite the continued difficult economic conditions, we have generally preserved our operating margins through cost savings efforts and the benefits of our diversified business model. Many of our customers remained cautious in the quarter, but we believe inventory reductions were reaching an end in certain markets and our third quarter results improved sequentially over our second quarter results. Although it was still a challenging quarter, we maintained our strong balance sheet.
Pfeiffer added, Our Beauty & Home segment sales declined 7%, excluding currency effects, primarily due to continued weak demand from the fragrance/cosmetic market in North America and Europe. This weakness was partially offset by continued strong demand from South America and Asia, and we benefited from improved demand in the personal care market. Beauty & Home segment income declined 21% or $4.6 million in the quarter primarily due to underutilized overhead and the negative impact of a $1.2 million charge relating to severance expenses. Excluding the charge for severance expenses, Beauty & Home segment income declined 16% or $3.3 million.
Our Closures segment sales declined 9%, excluding currency effects and acquisitions, due to the pass-through of resin cost decreases and weak demand in Europe. We continued to see strong demand for our food and beverage closures in North America and this offset some of the weakness in Europe. Closures segment income decreased 15% or $1.8 million in the quarter primarily due to the negative impact of a $1.4 million charge relating to consolidation/severance expenses. Excluding the charge for consolidation/severance expenses, Closures segment income declined 4% or approximately $0.5 million.
Pfeiffer continued, Our Pharma segment reported stable performance in the quarter. Sales declined by 3%, excluding currency effects, primarily due to softer demand for our metered dose valves, but overall the segment reported another strong operating result. Pharma segment income declined 11% primarily due to lower sales and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates.
On a consolidated basis, operating income declined 12% to $52.9 million (including approximately $2.6 million of consolidation/severance expenses), down from $60.5 million a year ago.
Reported diluted earnings per share, which include the consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 16% to $.48 per share. Diluted earnings per share, excluding consolidation/severance expenses of approximately $.03 per share, decreased 11% to $.51 compared to $.57 per share in the prior year.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Year-to-date sales decreased 17% to approximately $1.3 billion from approximately $1.6 billion a year ago. Product and custom tooling sales declined 10%, changes in exchange rates accounted for 8% of the decrease and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales.
Operating income decreased 23% to $141.5 million (including approximately $5.7 million of consolidation/severance expenses), down from $183.1 million a year ago. Reported diluted earnings per share, which include the consolidation/severance expenses, decreased 26% to $1.27 per share. Diluted earnings per share, excluding consolidation/severance expenses of approximately $.05 per share, decreased 23% to $1.32 compared to $1.72 per share in the prior year.
SOUTH AMERICAN ACQUISITION
In the quarter, AptarGroup acquired Covit do Brasil Componentes de Alumnio para Perfumaria Ltda. (Covit do Brasil) for approximately $7.6 million. Covit do Brasil is a growing company that has been operating in Brazil since 2005 developing and supplying anodized aluminum parts primarily for the fragrance/cosmetic market. Covit do Brasil will generally be supplying parts to other companies within AptarGroup.
Commenting on the acquisition, Pfeiffer said, AptarGroup welcomes Covit do Brasils stamping and anodizing capabilities to the group. While this is a relatively small acquisition for us, their products and services will reinforce our product offerings, help us better serve our customers, and enhance our competitiveness in the fast growing South American markets.
OUTLOOK
Discussing the Companys outlook, Pfeiffer stated, The diversification of our business has been a stabilizing factor in challenging times and we expect that to continue. As we look to the fourth quarter, some of our customers remain cautious going into the end of the year given the continuing weak consumer sentiment and, consequently, our global visibility remains limited at this time. However, we are cautiously optimistic that inventories may be bottoming out in certain markets though we expect the softness in the fragrance/cosmetic market to continue in the near-term. We will continue to diligently manage our costs without jeopardizing the flexibility necessary to respond to our customers demands and we will maintain our strong balance sheet. When comparing our fourth quarter results to the prior year, it is important to note that declining resin costs in the fourth quarter of 2008 caused a $5.2 million reduction in our LIFO inventory reserve. This positive effect of approximately $.05 per diluted share is not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding facilities consolidation and severance program charges, we anticipate diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $.43 to $.48 per share compared to $.46 per share in the prior year.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable November 18, 2009 to shareholders of record as of October 28, 2009.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 100,000 shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 million leaving approximately 4.2 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
Aptargroup Reports Record Fourth Quarter Results
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 10, 2010--Aptargroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported fourth quarter and annual results.
Fourth Quarter 2009 Summary
Reported sales and profits increased across all segments
Consolidated sales increased 9%, 1% excluding currency effects
Operating profit increased 11% to $56.9 million, including a $1.8 million charge relating to consolidation/severance expenses
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 13% to record fourth quarter results of $.52 per share
Strategic realignment of businesses announced
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, reported sales increased 9% to $495.6 million from $455.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. When currency effects are excluded, sales increased 1% over the prior year.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, We are pleased to report record fourth quarter earnings per share. All of our segments reported sales and profits that were above the prior years levels. Movements in currency exchange rates contributed to our results and we were helped by a return to more normalized ordering patterns in certain markets. Demand remained strong in developing markets and our ability to leverage our cost structure across each segment helped our bottom line.
Looking at our Beauty & Home segment, sales of our innovative dispensing systems to the personal care market increased year over year and sales to the fragrance/cosmetic market continued to improve although they were lower than the fourth quarter of last year excluding exchange rate effects. Overall, Beauty & Home segment sales increased 3% excluding currency effects and segment income increased 51% or $6.8 million.
In our Closures segment, sales of products to the personal care, food, and beverage markets were strong in the quarter; however, this strength was masked by the negative impact from lower resin cost pass-throughs and lower tooling sales. Excluding changes in exchange rates, effects from resin pass-throughs and lower tooling sales, our core product sales would have increased approximately 10%. Lower resin cost pass-throughs had the effect of reducing our sales by 7% and lower tooling sales accounted for another 5% decline, resulting in a net decline in product and custom tooling sales of 2%. Closures segment income increased approximately 68% or $5.6 million.
Pfeiffer added, Pharma segment sales excluding exchange rate effects declined 2% in the quarter primarily due to softer demand for our metered valves. Pharma segment income increased 12% or $3.5 million.
On a consolidated basis, operating income increased 11% to $56.9 million. Cost containment efforts, increased operating efficiencies and currency exchange rate effects contributed to the increase in operating income. The fourth quarter 2009 operating income included the negative impact of a $1.8 million charge relating to consolidation/severance expenses. Fourth quarter 2008 operating income of $51.1 million included the positive impact of a $5.2 million reduction to the LIFO inventory reserve. The effects of changes to the LIFO inventory reserve are included in the Corporate Expenses and Other line of the Segment Information table.
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $.52 per share (including the negative impact of approximately $.02 per share from the consolidation/severance charges) compared to $.46 per share in the prior year (including the positive impact of approximately $.05 per share from the LIFO inventory reserve reduction).
ANNUAL RESULTS
Commenting on Aptargroups full year performance, Pfeiffer said, The year 2009 was one of our most challenging periods ever but the strong fourth quarter results were encouraging. The global economic crisis touched all of our segments as consumer spending was greatly reduced. Also, our customers were cautious throughout most of the year and, as a result, they reduced their inventory levels particularly in the first half of the year. This caused order quantities to decline which hampered our ability to grow the top line. However, as we have done in the past, we managed to reduce costs without affecting our ability to quickly respond to our customers when the markets stabilized.
Our businesses in the developing countries did well as demand for our products remained strong in those regions and the continued conversion to convenient dispensing systems in the food and beverage markets was a positive driver for our Closures segment. The competitive pricing environment, faced particularly by our Beauty & Home and Closures segments, remained challenging throughout the year.
Reported annual sales decreased 11% to $1.8 billion from $2.1 billion a year ago. Product sales (excluding changes in exchange rates) declined 7%, changes in currency exchange rates accounted for a 5% decrease and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales. Operating income decreased 15% to $198 million (including the negative impact of a $7.6 million charge relating to consolidation/severance expenses) compared to $228.4 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share decreased 18% to $1.79 per share, including the negative impact of $.07 per share relating to consolidation/severance charges.
Aptargroup spent approximately $30 million to repurchase approximately 885 thousand shares of common stock in 2009, leaving approximately 3.7 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Also during the year, a total of $40.6 million was paid to stockholders in the form of dividends, or $.60 per share.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, While encouraged by our fourth quarter results, we are clearly not yet completely done feeling the effects of the economic crisis. The difficult unemployment situation in the U.S. and the generally sluggish economies in Europe will take some time to rebound.
Looking forward, the first quarter results are expected to show improvement compared to the prior year. Preliminary indications are that consumer confidence, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, will continue to rise and demand for our personal care and fragrance/cosmetic dispensing systems will be above prior year levels, and demand for our food and beverage dispensing systems will be driven by the continued conversion away from non-dispensing packaging. In addition, we expect stable demand for our unique drug delivery solutions and services from the pharmaceutical market.
We currently estimate that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2010 will be in the range of $.48 to $.53 per share compared to $.38 per share in the prior year.
STRATEGIC REALIGNMENT
The Company is announcing that in 2010 it is undertaking a strategic realignment of its businesses under three market-focused business segments. Pfeiffer commented on the strategy, We have always been driven to better serve our customers by enhancing our understanding of their needs and the changing markets in which they operate. By realigning our businesses in a way that is completely market focused, we will make it even easier for customers to do business with us, and we will be able to offer our full product range in each of our three segments: Aptar Beauty + Home, Aptar Food + Beverage and Aptar Pharma. The new structure will also broaden and accelerate the development of innovative new products with a global focus on market applications and consumer preferences.
Pfeiffer continued, This realignment will take some time to complete and we expect to be fully operating under the new structure beginning in 2011. Once the realignment is complete, we will have a simplified customer-facing structure with three focused brands. We are confident that this next strategic step will put us in position to continue our long-term growth and lead our niche for many years to come.

Exhibit 99.1
Aptargroup Reports Record First Quarter Earnings Per Share
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 15, 2010--Aptargroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter earnings per share. Also, the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share.
First Quarter 2010 Summary
Reported diluted earnings per share jumped 47% to a first quarter record of $.56
Beauty & Home and Closures segments experienced strong volume growth
Demand from the fragrance and personal care markets helped drive results
Pharma segment maintained stable performance and operating margin
Sales rose 11% (excluding currency effects)
License agreement which expands product offerings announced
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, reported sales increased 17% to $505.5 million from $431.8 million in the first quarter of 2009. When currency effects are excluded, sales increased 11% over the prior year.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Both our Beauty & Home and Closures segments turned in exceptional operating results driven by rebounding demand in the personal care and fragrance/cosmetic markets. Our strategy to manage our cost structure, without sacrificing critical capacity or research and development, has kept us in position to serve our customers well as their businesses return to more normalized levels with the improving economic outlook. Beauty & Home sales increased 17% excluding changes in currency exchange rates and segment income jumped 150% to $27 million. Closures sales increased 9% excluding changes in currency exchange rates and segment income rose 47% to $17.1 million. Our Pharma segment turned in another stable performance as sales excluding changes in currency exchange rates decreased slightly and segment income increased 2% to $29.7 million.
On a consolidated basis, operating income increased 52% to $61.6 million. This improved performance was driven by strong sales in our Beauty & Home and Closures segments combined with the stable operating margin of our Pharma segment. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 47% to a record $.56 per share, compared to $.38 per share in the prior year.
LICENSE AGREEMENT
In the quarter, the Company entered into a license agreement that will support future growth primarily in the food and beverage markets. The cost of prepaid royalties and certain supporting equipment was approximately $3 million. Commenting on the transaction, Pfeiffer stated, This is a strategic step that broadens our product range with cost-effective closure systems that have certain tamper evident features such as foil seals and pull rings. These systems, which are already on the market, have many potential applications, especially in the food and beverage markets.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Our visibility has improved somewhat. We anticipate that the recovering economic climate in conjunction with the absence of the inventory destocking we experienced in the first half of 2009 will lead to our growth in the second quarter over the prior year. We presently expect demand to remain strong from those markets that were most seriously affected by the economic downturn including the fragrance/cosmetic and personal care markets.
We currently estimate that diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2010 will be in the range of $.60 to $.65 per share compared to $.41 per share in the prior year which included approximately $.03 per share related to charges from our consolidation/severance program that began in the second quarter of last year.

Exhibit 99.1
Aptargroup Earnings Jump to New High and Board Raises Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 20, 2010--Aptargroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record quarterly earnings per share. The Companys Board of Directors also announced a 20% increase to the quarterly cash dividend.
Second Quarter 2010 Summary
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 63% to all-time record of $.67
Reported sales rose 19%
All segments achieved double digit core revenue growth
Strong volumes drove improved capacity utilization
Cost containment efforts contributed to earnings growth
Quarterly dividend raised 20% to $.18 per share
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Reported sales increased 19% to $522.9 million from $440.5 million a year ago despite currency effects which negatively affected sales growth by 3%.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, This was an exceptional quarter for us across the board. Our decision to reduce certain costs during the economic downturn last year without sacrificing critical research or capacity was the right move. We put ourselves in position to take advantage of rising demand as our customers businesses regained their momentum. And this momentum, which we saw in the first quarter, carried over into the second quarter. Demand was particularly strong from the fragrance, cosmetic, and personal care markets and appears to be a blend of increased consumer consumption and the absence of inventory destocking that occurred last year. Sales to the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical markets were also quite good in the quarter. Each business segment posted increases in sales and income.
Pfeiffer continued, Increased volumes drove improved capacity utilization and, combined with our cost containment efforts, contributed to record operating income of $74 million and record earnings per share. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 63% to a record $.67 per share, compared to $.41 per share in the prior year. Prior year earnings per share included the negative effect of $.03 per share from charges related to our consolidation/severance program.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, We are very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year. Our business model is again confirmed. Committing to being the innovative leader in the dispensing system niche, offering a broad product range, serving multiple end markets, and being present in strategic regions around the globe are not only critical to our ability to weather difficult short-term economic times like we experienced a year ago, but are also the basis of our growth over the long-term.
Year-to-date sales increased 18% to a record $1.03 billion from $872.3 million a year ago. Product sales increased 16% while changes in exchange rates added 2%. Operating income increased to $135.7 million, up 53% from $88.5 million a year ago. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 54% to $1.22 per share compared to $.79 per share a year ago. Prior year earnings per share included a negative effect of $.03 per share from charges related to the Companys consolidation/severance program.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, We remain cautiously optimistic that the markets we serve will continue to recover from the economic downturn of 2008/2009 and that our third quarter results will improve over the prior year. Movements in currency exchange rates are likely to result in some headwinds depending on where the rates settle in the coming quarter. We are encouraged by an increase in project activity primarily in the food and beverage markets and expect to fund additional capital expenditures related to these new projects. Currently we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.61 to $.66 per share compared to $.48 per share reported last year. Last years earnings per share included the negative effect of $.03 per share from charges related to our consolidation/severance program.
CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $.18 per share, payable August 24, 2010 to shareholders of record as of August 3, 2010. The increase brings the annual dividend rate to $.72 per share up from $.60 per share. During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for approximately $25 million, leaving approximately 2.9 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the second quarter.
Pfeiffer said, Our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to enable us to return value to shareholders with increased dividends and continued share repurchases while we remain in great position to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they present themselves.

Exhibit 99.1
Aptargroup Achieves Record Earnings on Solid Growth Across All Segments
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2010--Aptargroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported all-time high quarterly earnings per share. Also, the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.18 per share.
Third Quarter 2010 Summary
Strong first half momentum continued in third quarter
Broad-based growth reported across all segments
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 42% to all-time record $.68
Sales excluding currency effects rose 14%
Improved capacity utilization contributed to earnings growth
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended September 30, 2010, reported sales increased 9% to $517.5 million from $473.7 million a year ago despite the negative effects of changes in currency rates.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, This was another strong broad-based quarter for our Company. Each of our business segments reported improved sales and income over the prior year. In particular, our Beauty & Home and Closures segments each posted double digit sales growth rates. Our Pharma segment also contributed to the strong quarterly results with increased sales over the prior year. Year over year demand increased in each of the end markets we serve, with notable increases coming from the fragrance/cosmetic and food/beverage markets.
Pfeiffer continued, The strong demand, which was a continuation of the growth over the prior year that we experienced in the first half of the year, resulted in high volume levels and improved capacity utilization. Operating income rose to $71.1 million, up 34% over the prior year level of $52.9 million (which included approximately $2.6 million of consolidation/severance expenses). Reported diluted earnings per share increased 42% to a record $.68 per share, compared to $.48 per share in the prior year. Prior year earnings per share included the negative effect of $.03 per share from charges related to our consolidation/severance program.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, We are particularly pleased that our businesses across the board have continued to perform well through the first nine months of the year. Sales to each of the end markets we serve increased over the prior year. This success is attributable to our commitment to innovation, our reputation as a reliable and stable partner, and ultimately, the value we bring to our customers brands.
Year-to-date sales increased 15% to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates had no effect on the year-to-date sales. Operating income increased to $206.8 million, up 46% from $141.5 million a year ago (which included approximately $5.7 million of consolidation/severance expenses). Reported diluted earnings per share increased 50% to $1.90 per share compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Prior year earnings per share included a negative effect of $.05 per share from charges related to the Companys consolidation/severance program.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, Looking forward, we are coming up against a more difficult comparison to a record fourth quarter of last year that was influenced by rebounding markets and the strong euro relative to the dollar. Today, the markets are returning to more normal patterns and the euro is in a weaker position than a year ago. We remain confident that our diverse business model will continue to be a buffer should there be any deceleration to the recent economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe. We currently expect fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.53 to $.58 per share compared to $.52 per share reported last year. Last years earnings per share included the negative effect of $.02 per share from charges related to our consolidation/severance program.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.18 per share, payable November 24, 2010 to shareholders of record as of November 3, 2010. Also during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for approximately $25.8 million leaving approximately 2.3 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
Aptargroup Achieves Record Fourth Quarter Results and Completes Strongest Year Ever
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 10, 2011--Aptargroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record fourth quarter and annual sales and earnings per share.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Summary
Results surpassed last years record levels
Sales, driven by growth across each segment, up 11% before currency effects
Higher custom tooling sales contributed 3% to the top line
Demand increased from the fragrance/cosmetic, food/beverage, and pharma markets
Demand for dispensing closures from the personal care market decreased
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 13% to record $.59
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2010, reported sales increased 7% to $530.8 million from $495.6 million a year ago despite the negative effects of changes in currency rates.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, We were up against a difficult comparison to our record fourth quarter of 2009 results but we surpassed those results on the strength of our broad product portfolio and the diversity of markets we serve. Our Beauty & Home segment posted strong sales in the quarter particularly due to increased demand from the fragrance/cosmetic market. Our Pharma segment sales also improved year over year mainly driven by increased custom tooling sales and improved demand for metered valves. Our Closures segment sales were positively impacted by strong demand from the food/beverage market as well as higher custom tooling sales and resin price adjustments. These positive effects were partially offset by weaker demand for dispensing closures from the personal care market."
Pfeiffer continued, Improved sales and profits in our Beauty & Home and Pharma segments drove our record fourth quarter earnings. We continued to capitalize on improved productivity resulting from strong demand and our cost containment efforts. Closures segment income declined from the prior year primarily due to the decreased demand from the personal care market and operational challenges caused by a high level of new project activity. Consolidated operating income rose to $61.2 million, up 8% over the prior year level of $56.9 million (which included approximately $1.8 million of consolidation/severance expenses). Reported diluted earnings per share increased 13% to a record $.59 per share, compared to $.52 per share in the prior year. Prior year earnings per share included the negative effect of $.02 per share from charges related to our consolidation/severance program.
ANNUAL RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, This proved to be an exceptional year for our company especially after following one of the most challenging years in our history. Throughout 2009, we took steps to reduce costs without jeopardizing key capacity and we were well positioned coming into 2010 to meet the recovery in demand, particularly from our Beauty & Home and Closures customers. Also, our Pharma segment posted another solid year of consistent growth, leading the nasal and pulmonary delivery device industry. We achieved record consolidated sales and profits by remaining focused on our customers needs, investing in research and development, implementing new technologies, and allowing for growth while closely monitoring our cost structure. We accomplished all of this even as we undertook a strategic step to further align our businesses with the markets we serve.
Year-to-date sales increased 13% to $2.1 billion from $1.8 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates negatively affected the sales growth by approximately 1%. Operating income increased to a record $268 million, up 35% from $198.4 million a year ago (which included approximately $7.6 million of consolidation/severance expenses). Reported diluted earnings per share increased 39% to a record $2.48 per share compared to $1.79 per share a year ago. Prior year earnings per share included a negative effect of $.07 per share from charges related to the Companys consolidation/severance program.
Aptargroup spent approximately $86 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares of common stock in 2010, leaving approximately 1.7 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Also during the year, a total of $44.5 million was paid to stockholders in the form of dividends, or $.66 per share. This reflects the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend approved by the Board in July of 2010.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, We are confident that our strategically aligned businesses will continue to grow in 2011. While we experienced exceptional growth in 2010, we anticipate that generally our segments will reflect more normalized growth rates going forward. Though several challenges lie ahead, including rising input costs and our ability to pass through such increases in a timely manner, we have faced similar challenges in the past. Our financial condition is as strong as it has ever been, and we remain committed to investing in new technologies and new products. Our strategy is to continue to probe deeper into our markets to tap underserved sectors, to get even closer to our customers and help them grow their brands, and to better understand the needs of end consumers in order to provide them with the worlds most innovative dispensing solutions. As we look to the first quarter of 2011, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.60 to $.65 per share compared to $.56 per share reported last year.

As previously disclosed, AptarGroup (the Company) implemented certain changes to its segment reporting structure beginning January 1, 2011.  From 2006 through 2010, the Company had three reportable business segments:  Beauty & Home, Closures and Pharma.  Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, AptarGroup's new organizational structure consists of three market-focused lines of business which are Beauty + Home, Pharma and Food + Beverage. This new structure is a strategic step to become more closely aligned with our customers and the markets in which they operate.  Prior period information has been conformed to the new reporting structure and is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
The most significant change relates to sales and income of dispensing closures to the personal care market that were included in the Closures segment in the past which are now included in the new Beauty + Home segment.  To a lesser degree, sales of our products used with over-the-counter consumer healthcare products that were included in the old Beauty & Home and Closures segments are now included in the new Pharma segment.  In addition, stock option expense and certain IT expenses that were included in Corporate and Other in the past are allocated to the new segments.
 
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter Results on Continued Strong Momentum
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2011--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter sales and earnings per share.
First Quarter 2011 Summary
Reporting began for the newly realigned business segments
Double-digit top line growth across each segment
Consolidated sales rose 14% to record first quarter level of $576.5 million
Food + Beverage custom tooling sales up $9 million
Pharma segments strong profitability drove record earnings
Achieved record first quarter earnings per share of $.64
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, reported sales increased 14% to a first quarter record $576.5 million from $505.5 million a year ago. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1% to the sales growth.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, I am pleased to report that the positive momentum we experienced last year continued in the first quarter of 2011. Each business segment recorded strong top line core growth over the prior year even though we are up against tough comparisons to our record performance in 2010. Demand for our Beauty + Home segments innovative fragrance and cosmetic dispensing systems increased in all regions with Latin America continuing to be particularly strong. Our Pharma segment also had a strong quarter with increased global demand for our industry leading pulmonary and nasal delivery systems for prescription medicines and consumer health care products. Our Food + Beverage segment posted strong sales growth that was driven by increased demand for our convenient dispensing closures as well as increased tooling sales compared to the prior year.
Pfeiffer continued, The strong volumes across all segments in the quarter contributed to favorable capacity utilization. Some gains were offset by continued operational issues related to new dispensing closures project activity in our Beauty + Home and Food + Beverage segments, however, these issues have improved since the fourth quarter of last year. Also, raw material cost increases and higher stock option expenses negatively impacted each segments earnings in the quarter. In addition, we incurred higher professional fees in our Beauty + Home segment and new personnel costs associated with the expansion of our Food + Beverage segment. Overall, our consolidated operating income rose to $69.8 million, up 13% over the prior year level of $61.6 million. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 14% to a first quarter record $.64 per share, compared to $.56 per share in the prior year.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, We are encouraged by the high level of project activity across all of our segments. As part of our strategic realignment, we created our Food + Beverage segment and we are evaluating locations in the U.S. for a new facility to better serve our food and beverage customers. Looking to the second quarter, we anticipate sales and earnings improvement over the prior years exceptionally strong results. This growth will be driven by a continuation of the momentum from the first quarter as well as new projects. We expect the input cost environment to remain challenging in the near term, but we are committed to passing on inflationary increases whenever possible. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.72 to $.77 per share compared to $.67 per share reported last year.

At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 4, 2011, the stockholders of AptarGroup, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's 2011 Stock Awards Plan (the "2011 Plan"), which had been previously approved by the Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval.
 
The following paragraphs provide a summary of certain terms of the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan is set forth in its entirety as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The 2011 Plan provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and other entities in which the Company has a direct or indirect equity interest. The purpose of the plan is to promote the long-term financial interests of the Company and its affiliates by (i) attracting and retaining personnel, (ii) motivating personnel by means of growth-related incentives, (iii) providing competitive incentive compensation opportunities, and (iv) further aligning the interests of participants with those of our stockholders.  The 2011 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee.
 
The 2011 Plan will make 4,400,000 shares of common stock available for grants of stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under the 2011 Plan, (i) any shares of common stock that are subject to awards of stock options or SARs will be counted against this limit as one share of common stock for every one share of common stock granted (with the full number of shares of common stock subject to an SAR being counted rather than only the net shares granted), and (ii) any shares of common stock that are subject to awards other than stock options or SARs will be counted against this limit as 3.39 shares of common stock for every one share of common stock granted.
 
The Board of Directors may amend the 2011 Plan at any time by a resolution adopted by at least 70% of the members of the Board of Directors, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. No amendment may impair the rights of the holder of any outstanding award without his or her consent.

Administration
.
  The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or, if directors constituting not less than seventy percent (70%) of the whole Board of Directors so determine, by another committee consisting of not less than two (2) members of the Board of Directors. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or actions approved in writing by all members of the Committee, shall constitute the acts of the Committee.

The Committee may delegate any of its authority hereunder to such persons as it deems appropriate, except to the extent that any such delegation will prevent an award from complying with Rule 16b-3 or, in the case of an award that is intended to constitute "qualified performance- based compensation" under such Section 162(m) of the Code, from satisfying the conditions of Section 162(m) of the Code.

Shares Subject to Plan.
  Subject to adjustment as provided in , 4,400,000 shares of Common Stock shall be available for awards under the Plan, reduced by the sum of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which become subject to outstanding awards. Any shares of Common Stock that are subject to awards of stock options or SARs shall be counted against this limit as one (1) share of Common Stock for every one (1) share of common stock granted (with the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to an SAR being counted rather than only the net shares granted). Any shares of Common Stock that are subject to awards other than stock options or SARs shall be counted against this limit as three-and-thirty-nine one-hundredths (3.39) shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Common Stock granted. To the extent that shares of Common Stock subject to an outstanding award granted under either this Plan or any equity compensation plan previously maintained by the Company on behalf of employees are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration, termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such award (except in the case of an option to the extent shares of Common Stock are issued or delivered by the Company in connection with the exercise of a tandem SAR), then such shares of Common Stock shall again be available under the Plan (using the same formula used to count the award against the share limit as set forth above). Shares of Common Stock shall not again be available under the Plan by reason of withholding shares of Common Stock to satisfy all or a portion of tax withholding obligations relating to such award or using option proceeds to repurchase shares of Common Stock or by reason of a participant using shares of Common Stock to pay the exercise price of stock options or SARs awarded hereunder.

ISOs
Company. To the extent that the aggregate Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of shares of Common Stock with respect to which options designated as ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan of the Company, or any parent or subsidiary) exceeds the amount (currently $100,000) established by the Code, such options shall constitute nonqualified stock options.
(2)           The option price per share of Common Stock shall be fixed by the Committee at not less than 100% of Market Value on the date of the grant; provided that if an ISO is granted to any person who, at the time such option is granted, owns capital stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company (or of any parent or subsidiary) (a ""), the purchase price per share of Common Stock shall not be less than the price (currently 110% of Market Value) required by the Code in order to constitute an ISO.
Ten Percent Holder
 
(3)           Each option shall be exercisable at such time or times as the Committee shall determine at or subsequent to grant, provided that no option shall be exercised later than 10 years after its date of grant;  that if an ISO shall be granted to a Ten Percent Holder, such option shall not be exercised later than five years after its date of grant.
provided

The Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to clauses (B), (C) or (D), except that the Committee may not disapprove of an election made by a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

SARs may be tandem with any previously or contemporaneously granted option or independent of any option. The base price of a tandem SAR shall be the option price of the related option. The base price of an independent SAR shall be fixed by the Committee at not less than 100% of the Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR. The amount payable may be paid by the Company in Common Stock (valued at its Market Value on the date of exercise), cash or a combination thereof, as the Committee may determine, which determination may take into consideration any preference expressed by the holder.
 
(2)           Each SAR shall be exercisable at such time or times as the Committee shall determine at or subsequent to grant, provided that no SAR shall be exercised later than 10 years after its date of grant.
 
(3)           An SAR may be exercised (i) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of whole SARs then being exercised and (ii) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request. To the extent a tandem SAR is exercised or settled, the related option will be cancelled and to the extent the related option is exercised, the tandem SAR will be cancelled.

Qualified Performance-Based Awards
 
With respect to any award granted under the Plan that is intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code:
 
(1)           In no event shall any participant receive a payment with respect to any such award if the minimum threshold performance goals requirement applicable to the payment is not achieved during the performance period.
 
(2)           The Committee retains sole discretion to reduce the amount of or eliminate any payment otherwise payable to a participant with respect to any award. The Committee may exercise such discretion by establishing conditions for payments with respect to awards in addition to the performance goals, including the achievement of financial, strategic or individual goals, which may be objective or subjective, as it deems appropriate.
 
(3)           At the time of grant of such an award, the Committee shall, if applicable, determine a performance period and performance goals to be achieved during the performance period, subject to such later revisions as the Committee shall deem appropriate to reflect significant unforeseen events such as changes in laws, regulations or accounting practices or unusual or non-recurring items or occurrences (but only to the extent that any revision complies with Section 162(m) of the Code). Following the conclusion of each performance period, the Committee shall determine and certify in writing the extent to which performance goals have been attained.
 
(f).  A participant may elect to defer all or a portion of any award in accordance with procedures established by the Committee and in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Deferred amounts will be subject to such terms and conditions and shall accrue such yield thereon (which may be measured by Market Value and dividends thereon) as the Committee may determine. Payment of deferred amounts may be in cash, Common Stock or a combination thereof, as

Miscellaneous Provisions.
 
(a).  No award under the Plan shall be transferable other than (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Company or (ii) a transfer of stock options without value to a "family member" (as defined in Form S-8) if approved by the Committee. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, each award may be exercised or received during the participant's lifetime only by the participant or the participant's legal representative or similar person. Except as permitted by the second preceding sentence, no award shall be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to so sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any award, such award and all rights thereunder shall immediately become null and void. For the sake of clarity, no award may be transferred by a participant for value or consideration.
 
Nontransferability
 
(b).  In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than a cash dividend, the number and class of securities available under the Plan, the maximum number of shares available for any type of award or for grants to any person, the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding option and the purchase price per security, the terms of each outstanding SAR, the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding award, and the terms of each other outstanding award shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, such adjustments to be made in the case of outstanding options and SARs without an increase in the aggregate purchase or similar price; provided, however, that in the event of a cash dividend, other than a regular cash dividend, the Committee shall have the discretion to make any or all of the foregoing adjustments. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive. If any such adjustment would result in a fractional security being (a) available under the Plan, such fractional security shall be disregarded, or (b) subject to an award under the Plan, the Company shall pay the holder of such award, in connection with the first vesting, exercise or settlement of such award in whole or in part after such adjustment, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (1) the fraction of such security (rounded to the nearest hundredth) by (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the Market Value on the vesting, exercise or settlement date over (b) the exercise or similar price, if any, of such award.
 
Adjustments

The Company shall have the right to require, prior to the issuance or delivery of any shares of Common Stock or the payment of any cash pursuant to an award, payment by the holder of such award of any Federal, state, local or other taxes which may be required to be withheld or paid in connection with such award. An agreement relating to an award may provide that (1) the Company shall withhold cash or whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered upon exercise or settlement of the award having, in the case of Common Stock, an aggregate Market Value determined as of the date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes arises in connection with the award (the "") in the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation or (2) the holder of the award may satisfy any such obligation by any of the following means: (i) a cash payment to the Company, (ii) in the case of an option a cash payment by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom the optionee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise, (iii) delivery to the Company of previously owned whole shares of Common Stock (for which the holder has good title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having an aggregate Market Value determined as of the Tax Date, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (iv) authorizing the Company to withhold whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered upon exercise or settlement of the award having an aggregate Market Value determined as of the Tax Date, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (v) any combination of (i) and (iii), in each case to the extent set forth in the agreement relating to the award; , , that the Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to clauses (ii) through (v), except that the Committee may not disapprove of an election made by a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports All-Time High Quarterly Results;
Raises Dividend 22% and Increases Shares Authorized for Repurchase;
CEO Peter Pfeiffer to Retire at End of Year
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2011--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record quarterly results. The Board of Directors also increased the quarterly dividend and authorized the repurchase of an additional 4 million shares of common stock. Also, President and CEO, Peter Pfeiffer, announced his plans to retire at the end of the year.
Second Quarter 2011 Summary
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 10% to all-time high $.74
Reported sales rose 18% to record $615 million
Sales before currency effects grew 8%
Facility acquired in North Carolina to support Food + Beverage segment growth
Board raised dividend 22% and authorized additional shares for repurchase
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Reported sales increased 18% to a record $614.9 million from $522.9 million a year ago. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 10%.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, I am pleased to report that we achieved our best quarterly results ever. Each segment reported strong top line growth and our consolidated sales before currency effects increased 8%. Particular strength was noted in the fragrance/cosmetic, consumer health care, food and beverage markets. While core sales were strong, currency effects also contributed 10% to our top line growth in the quarter.
Pfeiffer continued, Looking at profits, we achieved record quarterly earnings per share of $.74 which was an increase of 10% over the prior year. Segment income increased at both our Beauty + Home and Pharma segments, while our Food + Beverage segments income declined compared to the prior year primarily due to the usual delay in passing along resin cost increases and new structure costs associated with the start-up of this new segment. Our Beauty + Home segment profit margins were also negatively affected by the timing of passing along resin cost increases as well as higher professional fees compared to a year ago. Our Pharma segment reported record quarterly segment income that was driven by strong core sales growth. All things considered, this was another very good quarter in terms of profits. Consolidated operating income reached a record $80 million in the quarter.
Also in the quarter, we completed the purchase of a facility in North Carolina that will be dedicated to serving our Food + Beverage customers.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, Even though we were up against a difficult comparison to 2010s record results, we reported very strong growth for the first half of this year. Our core sales increased 10% above prior year levels driven primarily by the strength from the fragrance/cosmetic, consumer health care, food and beverage markets.
Year-to-date reported sales increased 16% to a record $1.19 billion from $1.03 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates contributed 6% of the sales growth. Operating income increased to $150 million, up 11% from $135.7 million a year ago. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share a year ago.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, In 2010, we reported our strongest year in the history of the company and we followed that with exceptional growth in the first half of 2011. As we look to the third quarter, we anticipate growth at a pace that is more in line with our long-term normalized growth rates. We continue to be optimistic about our future and the many new opportunities that are being identified by our market-focused organization. We remain committed to investing in research and development and in high-growth areas of our business, including the food, beverage and consumer healthcare markets, as well as expanding in developing regions of the world. Currently we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.70 to $.75 per share compared to our previous all-time high quarterly earnings per share of $.68.
CASH DIVIDEND INCREASE AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 22% to $.22 per share, payable August 23, 2011 to shareholders of record as of August 2, 2011. The increase brings the annual dividend rate to $.88 per share, up from $.72 per share.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 600,000 shares of common stock for approximately $31.2 million leaving approximately 900,000 shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the second quarter. The Board today approved the repurchase of an additional 4 million shares.
Pfeiffer commented, Our excellent financial condition and our ability to generate strong cash flow allows us to return value to shareholders with increased dividends and additional share repurchases. With our strong balance sheet, we are in a good position to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they present themselves, while taking steps to improve shareholder value.
PETER PFEIFFER TO RETIRE
Peter Pfeiffer has advised the Board of his decision to retire effective December 31, 2011. Mr. Pfeiffer intends to continue to serve as a director of AptarGroup. The Board has selected Stephen J. Hagge, AptarGroups Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to succeed Mr. Pfeiffer as President and CEO effective January 1, 2012. Mr. Hagge has been the Companys Chief Operating Officer since January 1, 2008 and served as Chief Financial Officer from 1993 to 2008.
Pfeiffer commented, After working 40 years with this exceptional Company, I have decided to retire and spend more time with my family. AptarGroup has a very experienced senior management team that has worked closely together for many years. This team will be led by Steve Hagge who is a seasoned veteran with 30 years of experience in senior executive roles within AptarGroup. He has been integral to our success over the years, working very closely with me and our other senior executives in building AptarGroup into the industry leader it is today. I will continue to serve on our Board and I look forward to playing a part in our bright future.
Board Chairman, King Harris, said, Peter has had a very successful career that began with his familys business which eventually became part of AptarGroup. Under his leadership, Aptar maintained an entrepreneurial spirit while growing in size and gaining market share. Last year, he successfully guided AptarGroup through one of the most significant organizational changes in the Companys history when we realigned our businesses to become completely market-focused while at the same time, we achieved record sales and earnings per share.
Harris concluded, The Board is very confident in AptarGroups future under Steve Hagges leadership and we expect a very smooth transition. Steve has been a part of the Companys senior leadership team for three decades. He brings a variety of valuable experiences to the CEO office including his extensive operational and financial knowledge as well as his strong international business acumen.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record Third Quarter Results;
Expands Presence in India
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 26, 2011--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record third quarter results and announced an acquisition and new facility in India.
Third Quarter 2011 Summary
Reported sales rose 16% to a third quarter record of $601 million
Sales before currency effects grew 10%
All three segments continued strong core sales growth
Beauty + Home and Food + Beverage segment income margins were pressured
Reported diluted earnings per share increased 6% to a third quarter record of $.72
Presence in India expanding with post-quarter acquisition and new Pharma facility construction
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Reported sales increased 16% to $601.2 million from $517.5 million a year ago. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 6%.
Commenting on the quarter, Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO, said, I am pleased to report we achieved record third quarter results. Sales were driven by core growth from each of our segments and positive currency translation effects. Particularly strong increases in sales were recorded by our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. Our Pharma segment experienced strong demand from consumer health care and prescription drug customers for our industry-leading delivery solutions. Our Food + Beverage segments sales rose due to increased demand for our unique dispensing closures for beverage products as well as the continued success of several food launches by key customers. Our Beauty + Home segments sales grew over the prior year primarily due to increased demand from the personal care, fragrance/cosmetic and household markets.
Pfeiffer continued, We achieved record third quarter earnings per share of $.72 mainly due to the strength of our Pharma segment. Our Beauty + Home segments income declined compared to the prior year due to product mix, certain underutilized capacity, and higher professional fees. These negative effects, however, were more than offset by an increase in our Pharma segments income that was driven by strong sales volumes across all products and markets. While our Food + Beverage segments income increased over the prior year, it was negatively affected by higher structure costs for this new segment as well as start-up costs related to our new U.S. facility.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Pfeiffer stated, The first nine months of this year were very strong. Year-to-date reported sales grew 16% with core sales accounting for 10% of the growth and changes in currency exchange rates contributing the other 6%. The strong core sales growth was driven by growth in every segment. Year-to-date reported sales reached approximately $1.8 billion, up from $1.5 billion a year ago. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $2.08 per share compared to $1.90 per share a year ago.
EXPANSION IN INDIA
Earlier this month, AptarGroup acquired T.K.H. Plastics Private Limited (TKH), a leading provider of injection molded dispensing closures in India, for approximately $17 million in cash and $1 million in assumed debt. TKH has been serving the local Indian personal care, food, and beverage markets since 2000 and has been a licensee of AptarGroups dispensing closure products since 2006. TKH had annual revenues of approximately $8 million in the most recent fiscal year.
In addition, AptarGroups new pharmaceutical device facility in Mumbai is nearing completion. This facility, which is expected to be fully operational at the beginning of 2012, will provide clean-room capacity to serve AptarGroups customers in the region.
Commenting on the developments in India, Pfeiffer said, These steps are part of our strategy to expand our footprint in the region. We recognize that India is a significant and growing market. The acquisition allows us to better serve our personal care, food, and beverage customers and the clean-room facility will enable us to provide locally produced delivery devices to our pharmaceutical customers.
OUTLOOK
Pfeiffer commented, We are seeing some caution on the part of certain customers as we head into the end of the year, primarily due to global economic uncertainties. We believe this situation is temporary and that customers are assessing inventory levels after a relatively active past 12 months. Some customers are also intensifying price pressures in light of an unstable economic outlook, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. When we look at the variety of project activity, the strength and focus of our realigned organization, our broad geographic presence, and our strong balance sheet, we are encouraged as we look ahead to 2012. Currently, we expect fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.57 to $.62 per share compared to our record fourth quarter $.59 per share in the prior year.
CASH DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Board of Directors declared on October 19, 2011, a quarterly dividend of $.22 per share, payable November 30, 2011 to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2011.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 800,000 shares of common stock for approximately $38.8 million, leaving approximately 4.1 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.
OPEN CONFERENCE CALL
There will be a conference call on Thursday,October 27, 2011 at 9:00 a.m. CT to discuss the Companys third quarter results for 2011. The call will last approximately one hour.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 31, 2012, AptarGroup, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AptarGroup"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $300,000,000 with a syndicate of lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"), including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and Union Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agents, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.  The New Credit Agreement replaced the existing unsecured financing facility evidenced by the Amended and Restated Multicurrency Credit Agreement dated as of July 31, 2006, as amended prior to the date hereof (the "Prior Credit Agreement") among AptarGroup, AptarGroup Holdings SAS, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent.  AptarGroup initially drew $185,000,000 in borrowings on the effective date of the New Credit Agreement.  A portion of the proceeds of this initial incurrence of borrowings was used to repay in full the outstanding obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement.  The Prior Credit Agreement was terminated effective January 31, 2012 without any early termination penalty.
 
The New Credit Agreement provides for a $300 million revolving credit facility. The New Credit Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and events of default, including certain covenants that limit or restrict the ability of AptarGroup and its subsidiaries to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, incur indebtedness and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions. AptarGroup is also required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (equal to consolidated debt to total capital) of not more than 0.55 to 1.00. The final maturity date of the New Credit Agreement is January 31, 2017, subject to extension in certain circumstances.
 
Each borrowing under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest, at AptarGroup's option, at a rate equal to either (a) the rate for eurodollar deposits as reflected on the applicable Reuters LIBOR01 page for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (adjusted for any statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) (the "Eurodollar Rate"), plus the applicable margin or (b) the highest of (i) the rate of interest publicly announced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as its prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5% and (iii) the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%, in each case plus the applicable margin. A facility fee on the total amount of the facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of usage.  The applicable margins for borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and the facility fee percentage may change from time to time depending on changes in AptarGroup's consolidated leverage ratio.
 
AptarGroup has a number of other commercial relationships with the Lenders, the administrative agent, the co-syndication agents, the co-documentation agents and the co-lead arrangers and co-bookrunners or their affiliates. Such institutions and/or their affiliates have from time to time provided, and/or may in the future provide, various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking and other services to AptarGroup and its affiliates, for which they received or may receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02.  Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

Illegality
.  If any Lender determines that any change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund LIBOR Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate (including Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR), or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended, and all calculations of the Base Rate with respect to such Lender shall be made without reference to LIBOR, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or continue LIBOR Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR in the amount specified therein.

impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;

any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
 
(c)

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 9, 2012--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record fourth quarter sales and record annual sales and earnings per share.
Fourth Quarter 2011 Summary
Sales up 3% to fourth quarter record of $545 million
Strong sales growth in Pharma and Food + Beverage segments
Beauty + Home sales and margins affected by softness in the U.S. and Europe
Effective tax rate rose to 36.2% compared to 30.4% a year ago due to increased French taxes of $1.7 million primarily related to a surtax enacted in December
Reported earnings per share reached $.57 compared to $.59 a year ago
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, reported sales increased 3% to $544.5 million from $530.8 million a year ago. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates was insignificant.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen J. Hagge, President and CEO, said, The diversity of the markets and regions we serve once again proved that we can continue to grow in spite of softness in any one particular market or region. Consolidated sales grew on a reported and organic basis by 3%. As we anticipated, it was a challenging quarter for our Beauty + Home segment. We were going up against a strong fourth quarter of 2010 and certain customers remained cautious going into the end of the year particularly in the U.S. and Europe. However, strong results from Latin America and Asia allowed our Beauty + Home segment to achieve sales that were in-line with the prior year. Demand for our patient-friendly drug delivery devices from the prescription drug market drove our Pharma segments sales growth of 7%, and demand for innovative dispensing closures from the beverage market was the primary reason behind our Food + Beverage segments sales growth of 10%.
Hagge continued, Beauty + Home margins were pressured primarily by underutilized overhead resulting from the soft demand in the U.S. and Europe. In spite of this, our consolidated operating income reached a record fourth quarter level, driven by the profitability and sales growth of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. Our quarterly effective tax rate increased to 36.2% compared to 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate increased because of higher taxes in France of approximately $1.7 million that were primarily due to a retroactive surtax that was enacted by the French government in late December. Reflecting the impact of the higher tax rate, our reported diluted earnings per share reached $.57 per share compared to $.59 per share a year ago.
ANNUAL RESULTS
Hagge stated, I am pleased to report that 2011 was a record year for AptarGroup. Each segment reported sales growth over the prior year. We entered new market categories, made investments in our future, expanded our global presence, and ended the year with a strong balance sheet. Sales in 2011 increased 13% to a record $2.34 billion from $2.08 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates contributed approximately 4% to the sales growth. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 7% to a record $2.65 per share compared to $2.48 per share a year ago.
Also during the year, we were able to return value to our shareholders through corporate actions. AptarGroup spent approximately $102.6 million to repurchase approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock in 2011, leaving approximately 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. In 2011, a total of $53.3 million was paid to stockholders in the form of dividends, or $.80 per share. This reflects the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend approved by the Board in July of 2011.
OUTLOOK
Hagge commented, As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we are up against a difficult comparison to the prior year due to our strong results and a negative currency exchange rate environment. We also expect that certain customers will remain cautious into the first quarter. However, we are encouraged by the activity of 2012 customer projects and by our long-term growth prospects. Currently we anticipate that our first quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $.60 to $.65 per share compared to $.64 per share reported last year.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record First Quarter Revenue;
Earnings Per Share Equal Prior Years Record First Quarter Level
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2012--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported record first quarter sales. Earnings per share equaled the prior years all-time high first quarter earnings per share.
First Quarter 2012 Summary
Reported sales grew 3% (6% excluding currency effects) to first quarter record of $592 million
Changes in currency exchange rates negatively affected results
Each segments sales increased over the prior year
Operating income rose to record first quarter level of $70.4 million
Earnings per share of $.64 were equal to the prior years record first quarter level
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, reported sales increased 3% to $592.5 million from $576.5 million a year ago. Changes in currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 3% on the sales growth.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen Hagge, President and CEO, said, I am pleased to report we achieved record first quarter sales with core growth of 6%. Our Beauty + Home segment realized core sales growth of 3% on increased sales of our products to each of the markets we serve. Strong demand for our nasal dispensing devices drove our Pharma segments sales growth while increased demand for our value-adding dispensing closures from the beverage market was a key factor behind our Food + Beverage segments performance. We also had a very successful quarter in the emerging regions.
Hagge continued, Operating margins were negatively affected by increased custom tooling sales as well as costs associated with the start-up of our facilities in North Carolina and India. However, in spite of these negative effects we achieved record first quarter operating income. We also faced currency headwinds and a higher effective tax rate than the prior year but we maintained the same level of earnings per share as prior years record first quarter level.
OUTLOOK
Hagge commented, As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are encouraged by the many projects we are actively working on with our customers across all of our segments and we are on schedule with bringing our newer facilities capacity on-line. In the near-term, we expect a challenging input cost environment and there is inflation in some emerging regions. We also anticipate currency exchange rates to create stronger headwinds in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Presently we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.70 to $.75 per share compared to our all-time high quarterly earnings per share of $.74 reported last year.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Completes Acquisition of Stelmi Group;
Updates Second Quarter Earnings Guidance and Sets Second Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call Dates
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 9, 2012--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE: ATR) today announced it completed the acquisition of the Stelmi Group, in early July, after receiving the necessary regulatory approvals. As previously reported, this strategic acquisition expands AptarGroups portfolio of solutions that it provides to the pharmaceutical industry.
AptarGroup also updated its guidance on second quarter 2012 earnings per share to reflect acquisition costs related to the Stelmi acquisition, mentioned above. In addition, weaker than anticipated results for the Companys European operations and recent changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. AptarGroup currently anticipates second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62 per share compared to the previously announced guidance of $0.70 to $0.75.
Stephen Hagge, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, As anticipated, the closing of the Stelmi Group acquisition went smoothly and we have recorded the majority of the costs associated with this transaction in the second quarter. Our updated guidance includes a negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share related to the acquisition which was not included in our original guidance.
Hagge continued, In addition, we also experienced weaker sales volumes from our European operations. The U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably compared to the Euro since the end of the first quarter. Our previous guidance was based on foreign currency exchange rates at the end of March and our updated guidance includes a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share which represents the net impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates since the end of March.
AptarGroup intends to answer questions regarding its second quarter results during a conference call on Friday, July 27, 2012 at 8:00 a.m. CDT. AptarGroup plans to report its second quarter results after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, July 26, 2012. The call will last approximately one hour.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Second Quarter Results;
Declares Dividend
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2012--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported second quarter results and announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend.
Second Quarter 2012 Summary
Reported sales declined 6% (core sales increased 2% excluding currency effects)
Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted results
Softness in Europe affected each segment
Core sales increased significantly in Latin America and Asia
Stelmi Group acquisition closed on July 3, 2012, and will broaden Pharma segment portfolio
Earnings per share of $0.61 included a negative impact of $0.05 per share related to Stelmi acquisition costs
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, reported sales declined 6% to $578 million from $615 million a year ago. AptarGroup estimates that changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 8% in the quarter.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen Hagge, President and CEO, said, The diversity of our business enabled us to grow core sales in a challenging environment. Broad-based softness in Europe affected each of our business segments as the economic uncertainty there resulted in reduced consumer spending and increased caution by certain customers. Offsetting part of this weakness was strong demand from customers in Latin America and Asia.
Hagge continued, Currency exchange rates had a significant negative impact on our results in the quarter as did the costs related to the Stelmi acquisition. We estimate that the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 8% of the decline in sales and had approximately the same effect on earnings in the quarter. Traditionally, some of our cross-currency transactions have partially offset translation effects on earnings, but recently, the net transaction effect has become minimal. We reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.61, including the negative impact of $0.05 per share related to Stelmi acquisition costs, compared to $0.74 per share a year ago. If todays exchange rates were in place a year ago, we estimate that the prior years second quarter earnings per share would have been approximately $0.68 per share.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Hagge stated, We are very pleased with the growth we are seeing in Asia and Latin America. Even with the challenges presented by some of the economic uncertainties in Europe and the U.S., we grew consolidated sales excluding currency effects by 4% over the prior years strong level.
Year-to-date reported sales decreased 2% to $1.17 billion from $1.19 billion a year ago. Changes in exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 6%. Reported diluted earnings per share, which included a negative impact of $0.06 per share related to Stelmi acquisition costs, decreased 9% to $1.24 per share compared to $1.37 per share a year ago. If the 2012 exchange rates were in place in 2011, AptarGroup estimates that the earnings per share for the first six months of 2011 would have been approximately $1.30 per share.
STELMI ACQUISITION UPDATE
Hagge commented on the recent acquisition, We completed the Stelmi Group acquisition on July 3, 2012, and we are excited about the opportunities to grow this business. Our second quarter and year-to-date results were negatively affected by approximately $5.5 million ($0.05 per share) and $5.8 million ($0.06 per share), respectively, of professional fees associated with the acquisition. We expect the transaction to be accretive on an annual basis in the range of $0.12 to $0.16 per share, assuming current exchange rates. However, we anticipate that Stelmis results will have a negative impact of approximately $0.01 on earnings per share in the third quarter because of purchase price accounting adjustments and a small amount of additional professional fees related to the transaction. After the third quarter, we expect the transaction to contribute to our earnings growth.
OUTLOOK
Hagge commented, We currently expect the softness in Europe and the challenging currency exchange rate environment to continue into the third quarter. We are seeing some continued caution on the part of our customers, primarily from fragrance/cosmetic, personal care, and consumer health care customers in Europe. We expect earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.66 per share compared to $0.72 per share reported in the prior year. Its important to note that had todays currency exchange rates been in place a year ago, we estimate that the prior years third quarter earnings per share would have been approximately $0.65 per share. In addition, prior year results were positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share related to a lower effective tax rate.
CASH DIVIDEND

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Third Quarter Results; Announces European Operations Optimization Plan
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 1, 2012--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported third quarter results and announced a plan to optimize certain European operations.
Third Quarter 2012 Summary
Reported sales declined 2% (core sales increased 2% excluding currency effects and acquisition)
Certain markets in Europe continued to be soft; Latin America and Asia remained strong
Aptar Stelmi added $25 million in reported sales
Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 8% and earnings by approximately 7%
Earnings per share of $0.62 included a negative impact of $0.02 per share related to Aptar Stelmis results that included acquisition accounting effects
European operations optimization plan announced
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, reported sales declined 2% to $589.6 million from $601.2 million a year ago. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 8%. Recently acquired Aptar Stelmi contributed approximately $25.3 million or 4% to the quarterly sales growth.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen Hagge, President and CEO, said, The diversity of our business continued to help us achieve growth in a difficult environment. As we expected, it was a challenging quarter compared to the prior year, particularly in the beauty, food and consumer health care markets. Certain customers in the European beauty market remained cautious but this weakness was offset by increased demand from the personal care market. Global sales to the beverage market continued to be strong and this more than offset softer food volumes, mainly in the U.S. Also, demand from the consumer health care market, particularly in Russia and Eastern Europe, declined from last years very strong levels. However, our businesses in Latin America and Asia continued to perform quite well.
Hagge continued, The U.S. Dollar continued to be strong relative to numerous other currencies and this had a significant negative impact on our results. We estimate that the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 8% of the decline in sales and approximately 7% of the decline in earnings in the quarter. Included in our results for the first time were the results of Aptar Stelmi, our most recent acquisition. Aptar Stelmi contributed approximately $25 million to our sales but the required purchase accounting adjustments had a negative impact on earnings. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.62 included a negative impact of $0.02 per share from the Aptar Stelmi results which included the acquisition accounting adjustments. This compared to $0.72 per share reported a year ago. If todays exchange rates were in place a year ago, we estimate that the prior years third quarter earnings per share would have been approximately $0.67 per share. In addition, prior year results were positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share related to a lower effective tax rate.
YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, reported sales declined 2% to $1.76 billion from $1.79 billion a year ago. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 6%. Recently acquired Aptar Stelmi contributed approximately $25.3 million or 1% to the year-to-date sales growth.
Hagge commented on the Companys year-to-date performance, In spite of challenging conditions through the first nine months, weve been able to grow core sales by 3% and this is on top of strong sales growth last year. Sales growth in the beauty market has been negatively impacted by the recent softness attributable to economic uncertainties, principally in Europe. However, global beauty sales are above last years level for the nine months due to a good start to the year and continued strong growth in Latin America. Also driving our sales growth was strong demand for our innovative beverage closures as well as increased demand from the personal care and prescription drug markets over the prior year.
Hagge continued, Throughout the year weve been facing a challenging exchange rate environment. We estimate that on a year-to-date basis, changes in exchange rates have negatively impacted sales by approximately 6% with essentially the same impact on our earnings. Aptar Stelmis third quarter results contributed approximately 1% to our sales growth in the first nine months but negatively impacted earnings because of the required acquisition accounting adjustments.
Reported diluted earnings per share, which included a negative impact of $0.08 per share related to the Aptar Stelmi acquisition ($0.06 per share from acquisition costs and $0.02 per share from the third quarter Aptar Stelmi results that reflected the acquisition accounting adjustments), decreased 11% to $1.86 per share compared to $2.08 per share a year ago. If the 2012 exchange rates were in place in 2011, AptarGroup estimates that the earnings per share for the first nine months of 2011 would have been approximately $1.95 per share. Prior year earnings per share also reflect a positive impact of $0.04 per share from a lower effective tax rate.
STELMI ACQUISITION UPDATE
Hagge commented on the recent acquisition, We are extremely pleased with the progress of the Aptar Stelmi integration and the efforts of the combined team to make sure the business continues to grow uninterrupted. Customer feedback has been very positive and demand for Aptar Stelmis products has been strong in 2012. Volumes are up 9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. We continue to expect the Aptar Stelmi business to be accretive annually between $0.12 and $0.16 per share beginning in the fourth quarter.
EUROPEAN OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION PLAN
AptarGroup today announced a plan to optimize certain capacity in Europe. Due to increased production efficiencies and to better position the Company for future growth in Europe, AptarGroup will transfer and consolidate production capacity involving twelve facilities. Two of the related facilities are expected to close and this would impact approximately 170 employees. The locations involved in the operations optimization plan are facilities that are serving the beauty, personal care, food, beverage, and consumer health care markets. The total costs associated with the plan are estimated to be approximately 14 million (approximately $18 million using current exchange rates) of which approximately 4 million (approximately $5 million using current exchange rates) relates to non-cash expenses. The charges will be recorded in the quarter in which they are recognized for accounting purposes. Annual savings are estimated to be approximately 9 million (approximately $12 million using current exchange rates) beginning in late 2013.
Commenting on the operations optimization plan, Hagge stated, These actions are part of our long-term strategy intended to prepare us for future growth. We are benefiting from our continual investment in efficient production equipment and our ability to adapt to the changing needs of the markets we serve. In this instance, we looked at product lines, supply chains, and production capacity. We identified ways to streamline certain product technologies, reduce complexity for our people and our customers, and optimize our production footprint. This allows for a more efficient deployment of capital to support our growth in Europe.
OUTLOOK
Regarding the Companys outlook, Hagge stated, We continue to be encouraged by the level of new project dialogue we are having with our customers. We are also optimistic that our market-focused approach will yield new applications for our innovative dispensing technologies. Nevertheless, we expect further challenges in the fourth quarter, including continued currency exchange rate headwinds, ongoing softness in certain markets driven by economic uncertainties, and decreased demand for our prescription nasal spray pumps, mainly due to the generic allergy market having a high level of inventory at this time. It appears that the inventory management issue affecting our prescription nasal spray pumps is isolated to the fourth quarter.
Hagge continued, Our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance does not include any potential impact from our European operations optimization plan. Currently, we anticipate earnings per share for the fourth quarter, including approximately $0.03 per share from the results of Aptar Stelmi, to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.58 compared to $0.57 per share a year ago. Had todays currency exchange rates been in place a year ago, we estimate that the prior years fourth quarter earnings per share would have been approximately $0.54 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Fourth Quarter and Annual Results;
Updates Status of European Operations Optimization Plan
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 7, 2013--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported fourth quarter and annual results. The Company also updated the status of its previously announced plan to optimize certain European operations.
Fourth Quarter 2012 Summary
Reported sales increased 5% (core sales increased 2% excluding currency and acquisition effects)
Growth in the beauty, personal care, and beverage markets offset the anticipated softness in the generic allergy treatment market
Latin America and Asia sales growth remained strong
Reported earnings per share of $0.52 included the negative impact of $0.05 per share from charges related to the European Operations Optimization plan
Aptar Stelmi contributed $0.03 to earnings per share
Earnings were positively impacted by tax related items of $1.3 million, or approximately $0.02 per share
Quarterly dividend increased 14% to $0.25 per share
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, reported sales increased 5% to $571 million from $545 million a year ago. Recently acquired Aptar Stelmi contributed approximately $31 million or 6% to the quarterly sales growth. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 3%.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen Hagge, President and CEO, said, As we expected, it was a challenging quarter. However, similar to what we have seen in the past, the diversity of our business continues to shield us from significant variability in difficult times. Growth in the beauty, personal care, and beverage markets offset the expected softness in the generic allergy treatment market. Looking at our business from a geographic perspective, excluding the effects of currency rate changes and the Aptar Stelmi acquisition, we again experienced strong demand in Latin America and Asia which offset soft demand in North America. Our business in Europe was basically even with the prior year. Our market-focused strategy continues to reveal new opportunities. In the quarter, we saw a number of customer product introductions using our innovative dispensing systems.
Hagge continued, Aptar Stelmi had a good quarter and contributed $0.03 per share to our earnings while currency movements continued to be a headwind on our results.
In the quarter, the Company recognized charges related to its European Operations Optimization plan and this had a negative effect on earnings per share of $0.05. The Companys previous guidance for the fourth quarter did not include any impact from the optimization plan. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the charges related to this plan, were $0.57 and this equaled the prior years reported earnings per share for the same period.
ANNUAL RESULTS
For the year ended December 31, 2012, reported sales of $2.3 billion were approximately equal to the prior year sales. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 5%. Recently acquired Aptar Stelmi contributed approximately $57 million or 2% to the annual sales growth.
Hagge commented on the Companys annual performance, Our diverse product offering, broad global reach and deep penetration in multiple end markets drove growth in 2012. In spite of difficult conditions in certain markets, we were able to grow core sales by 3% over last years very strong performance. It was particularly challenging most of the year for our largest segment Beauty + Home primarily due to the economic situation in Europe causing customers to reduce orders. We also experienced a slowdown in our most profitable segment, Pharma, in the second half. Our Food + Beverage segment had a good year driven by the strength of our beverage closure business which more than offset a flat performance in the food market. On a geographic basis excluding currency effects and the Aptar Stelmi acquisition, Europe was softer than the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in sales to the beauty, personal care and home care markets. We continued to grow nicely in Latin America and Asia. Our business in the U.S. was up slightly from the prior year.
Hagge continued, Aptar Stelmis business continues to grow and our ongoing integration work is progressing well. This transaction, which was completed in July 2012, added 2% to our top line. We continue to expect the Aptar Stelmi business to be accretive annually between $0.12 and $0.16 per share and we look forward to leveraging our commercial network and our strong customer relations to continue growing this business.
Reported diluted earnings per share of $2.38 included a negative impact of $0.05 per share related to the Aptar Stelmi acquisition and a negative impact of $0.05 per share from charges related to the European Operations Optimization plan.
Hagge added, Our continued strong financial condition allowed us to return value to our shareholders through corporate actions. AptarGroup spent approximately $80 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock in 2012, leaving approximately 2 million shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. In 2012, over $58 million was paid to stockholders in the form of dividends, or $0.88 per share. Also, in January 2013, our board increased the quarterly dividend by 14% to $0.25 per share.
EUROPEAN OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION PLAN UPDATE
Commenting on the operations optimization plan, Hagge stated, Our plan to streamline certain product technologies, reduce complexity for our people and our customers, and optimize our production footprint is progressing as anticipated. We are currently in process of shutting down two facilities, one in Italy and the other in Switzerland.
In the fourth quarter, the Company recognized approximately $4.9 million of expense related to the plan, of which $1.6 million were non-cash expenses. The Company expects additional costs and savings from this plan in 2013. Using current exchange rates, the Company expects to recognize approximately $14 million in additional costs, most of which will be incurred in 2013. Annual savings of approximately $12 million are expected to begin later this year.
OUTLOOK
Regarding the Companys outlook, Hagge stated, Significant increases in U.S. raw material costs, particularly plastic resin, will create headwinds in the first quarter due to the timing of the pass-through of these increases to our customers. We are optimistic that both the U.S. and Europe will improve as the year progresses but we are somewhat cautious on the speed of those recoveries going into the first quarter. Also, we expect continued good growth in Latin America and Asia.
Hagge continued, Our first quarter guidance does not include any impact from our European Operations Optimization plan. Currently, we anticipate earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.69 compared to $0.64 per share a year ago.

Exhibit 99.1
AptarGroup Reports Record Quarterly Revenue with Earnings Per Share before Restructuring Charges Equal to Prior Year
CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2013--AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:ATR) today reported first quarter results. Reported revenue reached an all-time quarterly record. Earnings per share before restructuring charges were equal with the prior year first quarter results.
First Quarter 2013 Summary
Reported sales increased 4% to a quarterly record of $618 million (core sales excluding currency effects and the Aptar Stelmi acquisition decreased 1%)
Latin America and Asia sales growth remained strong
Reported earnings per share of $0.59 included the negative impact of $0.05 per share from charges related to the European Operations Optimization plan
Earnings per share excluding the charges related to the European Operations Optimization plan equaled the prior years reported earnings per share of $0.64
Beauty + Home segments sales and income were negatively impacted by softer than anticipated volumes in the U.S.
Pharma segments core sales were negatively affected by the anticipated softness in the U.S. generic allergy market though profitability remained strong
Aptar Stelmi contributed $0.06 to earnings per share
Food + Beverage segment had a strong quarter with 13% sales growth and 26% segment income growth
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, reported sales increased 4% to $618 million from $592 million a year ago. Aptar Stelmi, which was acquired in July of 2012, contributed approximately $35 million or 6% to the quarterly sales growth. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately 1%.
Commenting on the quarter, Stephen Hagge, President and CEO, said, Looking at our sales for the quarter, our Beauty + Home segment was negatively affected by weak volumes in the U.S. beauty and personal care markets. Our Pharma segment was negatively impacted by the anticipated softness in the U.S. generic allergy market and also decreased demand from the European consumer health care market. Aptar Stelmi had a terrific quarter and contributed approximately $35 million in sales. Demand for our Food + Beverage dispensing systems was strong in the quarter. Also, lower custom tooling sales across each segment had a negative effect on our core sales growth. Our operations in Latin America and Asia posted another quarter of strong growth.
Hagge continued, Our earnings in the quarter, before any effect of the European Operations Optimization plan, were negatively impacted by a decline in our Beauty + Home segments income that was primarily due to weak sales and certain operational inefficiencies in the U.S. In spite of the soft U.S. generic allergy and European consumer health care markets, our legacy Pharma business maintained a strong level of profitability. Also, Aptar Stelmi achieved a high level of productivity and, as a result, posted strong earnings for the quarter. In addition, our Food + Beverage segment was able to leverage their strong sales volumes and increase profitability compared to the prior year. We did experience higher resin costs in the quarter, but we were able to mitigate some of the impact due to our pass-through of the increases.
In the quarter, the Company recognized charges related to its European Operations Optimization plan and this had a negative effect on earnings per share of $0.05. The Companys previous earnings per share guidance for the first quarter did not include any impact from the optimization plan. First quarter earnings per share, excluding the charges related to this plan, were $0.64 and this equaled the prior years reported earnings per share for the same period.
EUROPEAN OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION PLAN UPDATE
Commenting on the previously announced operations optimization plan, Hagge stated, Our plan is progressing well and as expected.
In the first quarter, the Company recognized approximately $4.5 million of expense related to the plan, of which $0.5 million were non-cash expenses. Using current exchange rates, the Company expects to recognize approximately $9 million in additional costs, most of which will be incurred in 2013. Annual savings of approximately $12 million are expected to begin later this year.
OUTLOOK
Regarding the Companys outlook, Hagge stated, Looking to the second quarter, we anticipate our Beauty + Home segments income to improve from the disappointing first quarter results. We are optimistic that our legacy Pharma business will see more normalized order levels in the U.S. generic allergy and European consumer health care markets in the second quarter. Also, Aptar Stelmi is expected to continue to perform well. Our Food + Beverage segment is expected to continue to grow over the prior year.
Hagge continued, Our second quarter earnings per share guidance does not include any impact from the costs of our European Operations Optimization plan. Currently, we anticipate earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.78 compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. Prior year reported earnings per share included a negative impact of $0.05 per share related to costs associated with the Aptar Stelmi acquisition.
OPEN CONFERENCE CALL
There will be a conference call on Friday, April 26, 2013 at 8:00 a.m. CT to discuss the Companys first quarter results for 2013. The call will last approximately one hour.
