Exhibit 99.1
[PIONEER STANDARD LOGO]
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, Ohio  January 14, 2003  Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIOS) today announced that, following a comprehensive long-term strategic review of its industries, market trends and future growth prospects, the Company has decided the best opportunities for future growth with the greatest returns reside with its computer business. As a result, Pioneer-Standard is divesting its components distribution business.
As announced in a joint news release issued earlier today, Pioneer-Standard has signed a definitive agreement to sell its electronic components distribution business to Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: ARW) for approximately $285 million in cash. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining necessary government approvals, and is expected to be completed within the next several months. In the interim, Pioneer-Standard will work with Arrow to conclude plans related to personnel and facilities.
"This is the beginning of an exciting transformation of Pioneer-Standard," said Arthur Rhein, president and chief executive officer. "We already are the best at providing the infrastructure to enable the adoption of new technology to meet the strategic business needs of solution providers and end users. We will now have the financial flexibility to be much larger.
 
"Since becoming CEO in April of 2002, I have worked with our senior management team and Board of Directors to analyze our businesses and how we could best achieve higher levels of more sustainable profitability," Rhein added. "We determined that our computer business enjoyed a much stronger market position in a more stable industry with significant growth opportunities.
"Monetizing the value of our component distribution business will allow us to fund the continued growth of our computer systems business which serves diverse industries and markets through multiple channels," Rhein said.
Pioneer-Standard's Computer Systems Division is a leading distributor and one of the largest solution providers of enterprise computer products, computer system solutions and services by HP, IBM, Intel and Oracle as well as many other highly respected names in technology. The Computer Systems Division accounted for 56 percent, or $1.3 billion, of the Company's consolidated sales for the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2002, and generated operating earnings of $47.8 million.
Sale of Industrial Electronics Division
Regarding the agreement to sell its Industrial Electronics Division to Arrow, Rhein said, "As a leading global distributor of electronic components, Arrow is an ideal buyer for this business. I want to personally thank the employees of our electronic components business for all their hard work and dedication in building a distribution business of great value and wish them every continued success with Arrow."
Proceeds from the sale of the components business will increase Pioneer-Standard's financial flexibility and will be used to reduce debt and fund growth of the computer systems business beginning in fiscal 2004. JP Morgan was the financial advisor to Pioneer-Standard for this transaction.
 
The Industrial Electronics Division is a broad-line distributor of semiconductors, interconnect, passive and electromechanical components, power supplies and embedded computer products. The Industrial Electronics Division accounted for 44 percent, or $1.0 billion, of the Company's consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, and reported an operating loss of $3.6 million. The current annual sales run rate for the distribution business being sold is approximately $700 million.
Business Outlook for Pioneer-Standard
"We believe we can reach higher levels of more sustainable profitability and achieve a better return on invested capital as a computer systems company," said Rhein. "For many years, we have been allocating our investments across three fields of endeavor: our components distribution business, our computer systems business and the technology shared by both; and our returns, although somewhat mixed, have been better in our computer systems business. We have the opportunity to improve our returns by focusing our investments on the computer systems business which has provided better, more stable returns and has excellent growth potential," Rhein said.
"We are very excited about our future as a computer systems company, and have established goals that include growing sales at a rate better than the 8 to 10 percent compound annual growth rate forecasted for worldwide information technology spending," Rhein continued. "We also want to grow earnings at a compound annual growth rate greater than sales, and maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio in the range of 25 to 35 percent."
Upon closing of the transaction, Pioneer-Standard will file an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will include pro forma statements reflecting the divestiture of the component distribution business. In the interim, the attached selected financial information should be read in conjunction with previously reported segment data.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MELVILLE, NEW YORK, January 14, 2003  Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW) and Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIOS) announced that they have signed a definitive agreement under which Arrow will acquire substantially all of the assets of Pioneer-Standard's Industrial Electronics Division (IED) for a purchase price of approximately $285 million in cash (subject to various adjustments, including an audit of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed). Arrow will utilize a portion of its cash and short-term investments on hand (approximately $650 million at year-end) to fund the purchase price and will not incur additional borrowings.
Pioneer-Standard will remain a public company, focused on its computer systems business and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Sales of the portion of the IED business being acquired by Arrow (which does not include the high volume CPU business) are estimated to be approximately $700 million per annum. As such, IED is one of the largest distributors of electronic components to industrial customers in North America.
The IED business will be integrated into Arrow's North American Components businesses, and the combination is expected to generate cost savings and other synergies of at least $60 million per year (principally reflecting warehousing, facilities, IT systems, and other support functions not being acquired by Arrow, coupled with reductions in headcount in response to multiple people performing similar functions). As a result, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings for Arrow (even if one were to assume sales attrition of as much as 20 or 25 percent). It is currently estimated that the transaction will add approximately $.20 per share to Arrow's earnings in the first full year following the integration.
 
"We are delighted to be adding IED's customers, suppliers, and employees to the Arrow family," said Daniel W. Duval, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Arrow, "and we believe that our strong global presence and broad value-added capabilities position us well to serve the needs of those suppliers and customers, whether here in North America or elsewhere around the world." "Arrow has long been recognized as our industry's leader in integrating companies," he added, "and we have confidence in the ability of our management team to integrate IED into our customer focused selling groups in North America and achieve the targeted cost savings and synergies."
"This is the beginning of an exciting transformation of Pioneer-Standard into a computer systems company," said Arthur Rhein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pioneer-Standard. "After several months of analyzing the industries we serve, the long-term market trends and our future growth prospects, we made the decision that the best opportunities for future growth with the greatest returns on investment reside with our $1.3 billion computer systems business. Exiting the electronic components industry by selling our components business to Arrow, a leading global distributor, will monetize the value we have established in our Industrial Electronics Division and create the financial flexibility for Pioneer-Standard to pursue the significant growth opportunities available in the computer industry."
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining necessary government approvals, and is expected to be completed within the next several months.
Arrow Electronics is one of the world's largest distributors of electronic components and computer products and a leading provider of services to the electronics industry.

Sellers and their independent public accountant ("SELLERS' ACCOUNTANT") shall make all of their work papers and other relevant documents in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet available to Purchasers and Purchasers' Accountant, and shall make the persons in charge of the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet available for reasonable inquiry by Purchasers and Purchasers' Accountant. (C) Purchasers shall notify Sellers in writing as soon as practicable, and in no event more than 30 days, following receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Certificate if they do not agree with the Closing Date Net Book Value set forth thereon, in which case Purchasers and Purchasers' Accountant, on the one hand, and Sellers and Sellers' Accountant, on the other, will use good faith efforts during the thirty (30) day period following the date Sellers received such notice from Purchasers to resolve any differences they may have as to the Closing Date Net Book Value. Such written notice will identify with reasonable specificity the calculations with which Purchasers disagree or other bases for such disagreement. If Sellers and Purchasers cannot reach agreement during such thirty (30) day period, they shall submit their disagreements within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period to an independent, nationally-recognized public accounting firm jointly selected by Sellers' Accountant and Purchasers' Accountant (the "INDEPENDENT Accountant"), which shall conduct such additional review as is necessary to resolve the specific disagreements referred to it and, based thereon, shall determine the Closing Date Net Book Value. The review of the Independent Accountant will be restricted as to scope to address only those matters as to which Sellers and Purchasers have not reached agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Independent Accountant's determination of the Closing Date Net Book Value, which shall be completed as promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days following its selection, shall be confirmed by the Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on, each of Sellers and Purchasers for all purposes. (D) In the event that the Closing Date Net Book Value determined in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this SECTION 1.04(C), as the case may be (the "FINAL NET BOOK VALUE") is less than the Estimated Net Book Value (such difference being herein referred to as the "NET WORTH DEFICIENCY"), then Sellers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the date of determination of the Final Net Book Value (the "DETERMINATION DATE"), pay to Purchasers, if the amount of the Net Worth Deficiency exceeds the Holdback Amount, such excess amount and Purchasers shall retain the Holdback Amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, 10
if the amount of the Net Worth Deficiency is less than the Holdback Amount, Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to Sellers, the amount equal to the Holdback Amount less the Net Worth Deficiency. In the event that the Final Net Book Value is greater than the Estimated Net Book Value (such difference being herein referred to as the "NET WORTH EXCESS"), Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to Sellers the amount equal to the sum of the Net Worth Excess and the Holdback Amount. If the Final Net Book Value is equal to the Estimated Net Book Value, Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to Sellers the Holdback Amount. (E) Daily interest shall accrue on the Holdback Amount from the Closing Date until the payment thereof at an annualized rate equal to four and one-half percent (4 1/2%). Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable and the principal amount of the Holdback Amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Sellers may direct by written notice delivered to Purchasers. (F) If the Closing Date Net Book Value as determined by the Independent Accountant is closer to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by (i) Sellers than it is to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by Purchasers, Purchasers shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant for services rendered pursuant to this Section or (ii) Purchasers than it is to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by Sellers, Sellers shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant for services rendered pursuant to this Section. Otherwise, such fees, costs and expenses shall be paid equally by Sellers and Purchasers. (G) If the sale of the GmbH Shares and/or the Canadian Assets does not occur on the Closing Date due to the failure to obtain the necessary approvals of the Cartel Office and/or the Competition Bureau (as the case may be) but such approval(s) are obtained prior to the Drop Dead Date, then at the subsequent closing of the sale of the GmbH Shares and/or the Canadian Assets (as the case may be), the parties shall apply the principals and adjustment mechanisms set forth in this SECTION 1.04 to the GmbH Shares and/or the Canadian Assets (as the case may be) to obtain the same result as if such sale(s) occurred on the Closing Date. 1.05 CLOSING. (a) The Closing will take place at the offices of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, NY, or at such other place as Purchasers and Sellers mutually agree, at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the Closing Date. At the Closing, Purchasers will pay the Closing Purchase Price and the Canadian Purchase Price, less five percent (5%) of an amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price plus the Canadian Purchase Price plus the GmbH Purchase Price less the WPI Shares Purchase Price (the 11
"HOLDBACK AMOUNT"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts as Sellers may reasonably direct by written notice delivered to Purchasers by Sellers at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date. Simultaneously, (a) each of Pioneer, Pioneer Illinois, Pioneer Minnesota, and Pioneer LTD will assign and transfer to Arrow all of its right, title and interest in and to the U.S. Assets and Pioneer Canada will assign and transfer to Arrow Canada all of its right, title and interest in and to the Canadian Assets (in each case, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens) by delivery of (i) a General Assignment and Bill of Sale substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A hereto (the "GENERAL ASSIGNMENT"), duly executed by the applicable Seller, (ii) an assignment of the Intangible Personal Property, duly executed by the applicable Seller, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Purchaser, (iii) an assignment of the Real Property Leases, duly executed by the applicable Seller, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Purchaser, (iv) a Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT F hereto, duly executed by Pioneer and notarized in accordance with German Law, and (v) such other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchasers' counsel, as shall be effective to vest in the applicable Purchaser good title to the applicable Assets as and to the extent provided in SECTION 1.01(A) (the General Assignment and the other instruments referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) being collectively referred to herein as the "ASSIGNMENT INSTRUMENTS"); furthermore, Sellers will deliver to Purchasers a copy of the Deed of Incorporation and the Minute Book of the GmbH Subsidiary; (b) Arrow will assume from Pioneer, Pioneer Illinois, Pioneer Minnesota, and Pioneer LTD the due payment, performance and discharge of the U.S. Liabilities and Arrow Canada will assume from Pioneer Canada the due payment, performance and discharge of the Canadian Liabilities by delivery of (i) an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto (the "ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"), duly executed by the applicable Purchaser, and (ii) such other good and sufficient instruments of assumption, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Sellers' counsel, as shall be effective to cause the applicable Purchaser to assume the applicable Assumed Liabilities as and to the extent provided in SECTION 1.02(A) (the Assumption Agreement and such other instruments referred to in clause (ii) being collectively referred to herein as the "ASSUMPTION INSTRUMENTS"); and (c) if all of the WPI Necessary Approvals have been obtained prior to the Closing, Pioneer will deliver to Arrow certificates representing all of Pioneer's right, title and interest in and to the WPI Shares, each such certificate to be duly and validly endorsed in favor of Arrow or accompanied by a separate stock power duly and validly executed by Pioneer with requisite stock transfer stamps, if any, and otherwise sufficient to vest in the applicable Purchaser good and valid title in and to the WPI Shares. At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to Sellers and Purchasers the opinions, certificates and other contracts, documents and instruments required to be delivered under ARTICLES VI and VII. (b) If all of the consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and notices to, the Governmental or Regulatory Authorities specified in SECTION 2.14(A) OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, if any, necessary to vest in Arrow good and valid title to the WPI Shares ("WPI NECESSARY APPROVALS"), have not been obtained prior to the Closing, then Pioneer and Arrow shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all the WPI Necessary Approvals by such date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date (the "WPI DROP DEAD DATE"). If Pioneer and Arrow are able to obtain all of the WPI Necessary Approvals by the WPI Drop Dead Date, then, as promptly as 12
practicable after such date (the "WPI APPROVAL DATE") and at such place as mutually agreed by Pioneer and Arrow: (i) Arrow shall pay the WPI Shares Purchase Price to Pioneer and (ii) Pioneer shall deliver to Arrow Europe certificates representing all of Pioneer's right, title and interest in and to the WPI Shares. If Pioneer and Arrow are unable to obtain all of the WPI Necessary Approvals by the WPI Drop Dead Date, then Arrow shall not be obligated to purchase the WPI Shares or pay the WPI Shares Purchase Price to Pioneer. (c) In the event that at Closing all of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles VI and VII have been satisfied or waived except that the parties have not obtained the consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and notices to, (i) the Cartel Office necessary to vest in Arrow Europe good and valid title to the GmbH Shares and/or (ii) the Competition Bureau necessary to vest in Arrow good and valid title to the Canadian Assets, then (A) the parties will consummate the Closing without acquiring the GmbH Shares and/or (as the case may be) the Canadian Assets and assuming the Canadian Liabilities, (B) the Net Book Value of the GmbH Subsidiary and/or (as the case may be) of Pioneer Canada will be excluded from the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet and (C) Pioneer and Arrow shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such approvals from the Cartel Office and/or (as the case may be) the Competition Bureau by such date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date (the "DROP DEAD DATE"). If Pioneer and Arrow are able to obtain all of such approvals from the Cartel Office by the Drop Dead Date, then, as promptly as practicable after such date (the "GMBH APPROVAL DATE") and at such place as mutually agreed by Pioneer and Arrow: (1) Arrow shall pay the GmbH Purchase Price to Pioneer and (2) Pioneer shall deliver to Purchasers the executed Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement and shall deliver such other documents and take such other actions, if any, sufficient to vest in Arrow Europe good and valid title in and to the GmbH Shares.

If at the Closing Date the necessary approvals of the Cartel Office with respect to the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the Competition Office with respect to Pioneer Canada have not been obtained, the commencement date for the provision of services under the Transition Services Agreement with respect to the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the Canada Assets (as the case may be) shall be deferred until the closing(s) of the sale of the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the Canada Assets (as the case may be). 1.06 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) SELECTED EMPLOYEES. (i) At or prior to Closing, the Purchasers will extend offers of employment, commencing as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the Closing Date, at such salary, compensation levels and terms and conditions as such Purchasers may determine, to the Selected Employees, which offers shall be conditioned on the Closing. Each Selected Employee who accepts Purchasers' offer of employment shall become an 13
employee of the Purchasers as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the Closing Date and shall thereafter be a "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE". Purchasers shall assume all employment obligations accruing or arising after such time with respect to the Transferred Employees. In addition, Purchasers agree that in connection with their employment of any Transferred Employees, such Purchasers shall (x) give full credit for years of service with Sellers for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Purchasers' Plans, (y) impose no waiting period for benefits participation, and (z) impose no exclusions from health benefits for pre-existing medical conditions, other than those medical conditions excluded under Sellers' health plans. (ii) Subsequent to the Closing Date, Sellers, in their sole option, may retain or terminate any Employees other than the Transferred Employees, and Purchasers shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from the Sellers setting forth the names of such terminated Employees and the amounts actually paid by the Sellers to or on behalf of such terminated Employees, reimburse Sellers for any severance payments actually paid by Sellers to or on behalf of any terminated Employees pursuant to the Severance Policy as a result of the Sellers' termination of such Employees (x) on the day of the Closing or at any time during the two-week period after the Closing Date, (y) a later date to comply with the WARN ACT, or (z) with respect to any Employees who are retained by Sellers to provide services under the Transition Services Agreement, on the day of termination of such Employees by Sellers provided, HOWEVER, that Purchasers shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any severance payments made to any Selected Employees who are offered employment by Purchasers with substantially equivalent compensation and benefits, in the aggregate, to that currently being provided by Sellers to each such Selected Employee, and at the same work location or at a work location that is not more than fifty (50) miles from such location, and who do not accept the Purchasers' offer of employment; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Purchasers shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any additional severance to any vice-presidents not required by the Severance Policy as listed on SECTION 2.07 OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES.

Purchasers shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any such severance payments to Employees terminated by Sellers after the time periods specified in clauses (x) through (z) above. (iii) In the event that Purchasers offer any Selected Employee employment that is not substantially equivalent in compensation and benefits, in the aggregate, to that currently being provided by Sellers to each such Selected Employee, or which involves a change in work location of fifty (50) or more miles, and any such Selected Employee declines such employment, Purchasers shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from Sellers setting forth the names of such Selected Employees and the amounts actually paid by Sellers to or on behalf of such Selected Employees, reimburse Sellers for any severance payments Sellers actually pay to or on behalf of such Selected Employees pursuant to the Severance Policy. 14
(iv) Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Purchasers that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not trigger any "change of control", as such term is defined in any employment agreement or change of control agreement with or relating to any Employees. In the event that any claim or demand is made in respect of which an Employee asserts against or seeks to be collected from any of Purchasers any payments or other benefits arising in connection with a "change of control", including, without limitation, as a result of any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental or Regulatory Authority determining that a "change of control" has occurred that would trigger any payments or other benefits, Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers for all costs and expenses incurred in defending and/or paying any such claim or demand and any Losses or Liabilities related thereto. (v) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred Employee any right to continued employment by any of Purchasers, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of Purchasers to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee, with or without cause, subject to applicable law. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof. (vi) Sellers hereby waive, with respect to the solicitation of employment or employment by Purchasers of any Selected Employee, any claims or rights Sellers may have against Purchasers or any such Selected Employee under any non-hire, non-solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement or any cause of action based on similar rights arising by contract, at common law or by statute or regulation. Sellers hereby assign, to the extent legally permissible, to Purchasers all of Sellers' rights to enforce the provisions of any non-competition agreement between any of Sellers and any Transferred Employee and any non-hire, non-solicitation, confidentiality, assignment of inventions or similar agreement between such Sellers and any Transferred Employee. (vii) During the time that this Agreement shall remain in effect and for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, each of Sellers agree that it shall take no action, formal or informal, direct or indirect, to (A) solicit the employment of any Transferred Employees other than through general advertising not specifically directed at such employees, (B) hire any Transferred Employees of Purchasers, except as a result of actions permitted by clause (A) above, or (C) solicit, entice, induce or encourage any Transferred Employees or any other employee, consultant or independent contractor of Purchasers to terminate his, her or its relationship with any of Purchasers in order to become an employee of, or a consultant or independent contractor to, a person other than Purchasers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Sellers shall not be restricted from soliciting the employment of or hiring any Transferred Employees that have previously been terminated by Purchasers or have terminated their employment with Purchasers other than as a result of Sellers' violation of this SECTION 1.06(A)(VII). (b) WARN ACT NOTICES. Sellers shall be responsible for providing any notices required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN ACT"), and 15
shall hold harmless and indemnify Purchasers from and against any liability or damages resulting from Sellers' failure to comply with the WARN Act. (c) MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

(iii) Purchasers are not assuming any of the Benefit Plans of any of the Sellers, and Purchasers shall have no liability whatsoever to employees of Sellers with respect to accrued or future benefits under any such Benefit Plans (other than as provided in SECTION 1.02(A)(III)), whether or not any of such employees are offered employment by, or become employees of, Purchasers, and Sellers shall defend, indemnify and hold Purchasers harmless against any claims that they have liability under such Benefit Plans. (IV) [Intentionally omitted.] (v) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchasers shall establish or designate one or more 401(k) defined contribution plans ("PURCHASERS' 401(K) PLAN") in which the Transferred Employees shall commence to participate on the day after the Closing Date. Purchasers shall permit any Transferred Employee who was covered under a 401(k) defined contribution plan of Sellers ("SELLERS' 401(K) PLAN") to elect a direct rollover of the Transferred Employee's rollover-eligible distribution (including any outstanding participant loan) from Sellers' 401(k) Plan to Purchasers' 401(k) Plan. (vi) Except as expressly limited by this Agreement, Purchasers acknowledge and assume sole and exclusive responsibility for all decisions and actions relating to Purchasers' employment of any Employees, including, but not limited to, any and all decisions to hire or not hire, job assignments, compensation, and benefits. Accordingly, Purchasers agree to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers for any and all liability(ies) arising to Sellers from such decisions, if any, including, but not limited to, reimbursement of Sellers' attorneys' fees for defending any claims by any Employees relating to such decisions and actions of Purchasers, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, upon acknowledging Purchasers' obligation therefor, Purchasers shall have the right to assume control of any defense of such claims, including without limitation the selection of legal counsel, and, 16
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Sellers shall not make any payments to or on behalf of any such Employees in connection with such claims, as settlement payments or otherwise, without the express written consent of Purchasers. 1.07 THIRD-PARTY CONSENTS. To the extent that any Business Contract or Personal Property Lease is not assignable without the consent of another party, this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment thereof if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder. Sellers and Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such other party to the assignment of any such Business Contract or Personal Property Lease to Purchasers in all cases in which such consent is required for such assignment. If any such consent shall not be obtained, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchasers in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide for Purchasers the benefits intended to be assigned to Purchasers under the Business Contract or Personal Property Lease, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of Purchasers of any and all rights of Sellers against the other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise.

All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01 will be asserted and resolved as follows: (a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under SECTION 10.01 is asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Sellers or any Affiliates of Sellers or of Purchasers (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. 48
(i) If the indemnifying Party nofifies the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A), then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld in the case of any settlement as to which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full). The Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have waived its right to dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01 with respect to any Third Party Claim as to which it elects to control the defense. The Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this Section 10.02(a)(i), file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified Party's interests; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A)(I), and the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such separate counsel except as provided in the preceding sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith, based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under SECTION 10.01 with respect to such Third Party Claim. (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to SECTION 10.02(A), or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified 49
Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 10.02(A)(II), if the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A)(II) or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will bear all costs and expenses and reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A)(II), and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim under SECTION 10.01 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 10.01 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under SECTION 10.01 against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to SECTION 9.01, the failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 10.01 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the 50
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.

The companies jointly announced the agreement on January 14, 2003, when Pioneer- Standard also announced its strategic transformation to focus solely on its growth prospects as an enterprise computer systems company. The pre-tax proceeds of approximately $265 million related to the divestiture will include approximately $240 million in cash from Arrow, subject to adjustment on the basis of an audit of the assets and liabilities being sold, and the return of inventory to certain suppliers for cash of approximately $25 million.

"This will enable us to deliver higher levels of sustained profitability and enhanced shareholder value beginning in fiscal 2004." The Company noted that the sale includes substantially all of the assets of Pioneer-Standard's former electronic components division, with the exception of the division's owned and leased property, plant and equipment. Pioneer-Standard will dispose of these assets and anticipates receiving cash in the range of $8 to $12 million for these assets. The Company will file the required Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before March 17, 2003, which will include pro forma statements reflecting the divestiture of the electronic components distribution business, along with the purchase agreement.

With only 13 percent of the Notes tendered, the Company is now reducing its estimate for charges related to restructuring and discontinued operations to between $50 million and $60 million for its fiscal fourth quarter.

Exhibit 99.1 [PIONEER STANDARD LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PIONEER-STANDARD ELECTRONICS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2003 RESULTS - Fourth Quarter Pro-forma $0.07 Net Loss in Line with Previously Announced Guidance - Company Expects Improved Sales and Earnings in Fiscal 2004 CLEVELAND, Ohio - May 13, 2003 - Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIOS) today announced a net loss of $10.7 million, or $0.39 per share, for its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2003. This compares with a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.23 per share, for the fourth quarter last year. Because of the previously announced sale of the Company's Industrial Electronics Division ("IED") to Arrow Electronics, Inc., the attached financial statements have been restated to classify the IED operating results as discontinued operations. Results for the fourth quarter of 2003 included a pre-tax gain of approximately $53.5 million from the sale of IED. Offsetting this gain were pre-tax charges of approximately $31.6 million related to the disposition of IED and the operating loss of the division prior to the sale. These actions resulted in a pre-tax gain from discontinued operations of $21.9 million, or $14.2 million net of tax. In addition, several charges associated with the reorganization of the Company's ongoing business were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as discussed below. The Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These costs are specific to the impairment of facilities and other assets that were inconsistent with the Company's strategic plan and are no longer required, and severance costs incurred in connection with downsizing the corporate structure. A charge of $14.6 million was also recorded during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of the Company's investment in Eurodis Electron PLC, a European distributor of electronic components, to reflect the market value of Eurodis stock on March 31, 2003, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange. As a result of the sale of IED, the investment no longer holds strategic value for Pioneer-Standard, and the adjustment to market value was required. The Company also recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.2 million related to the retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding the discontinued operations and the reorganization charges discussed above, pro-forma net loss for the fourth quarter of 2003 would have been $2.0 million, or $0.07 per share. These results are in line with the Company's previously issued guidance on March 18, 2003 of a pro-forma net loss of $0.05-$0.10 per share. On a comparable basis, pro-forma net income would have been $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter last year. A reconciliation of the net loss reported for the 4
fourth quarter of 2003 and net income reported for the fourth quarter of 2002 to the above pro-forma amounts is included as an attachment to this press release. Sales for the quarter were $261.3 million, a decline of 8.5% compared with the fourth quarter last year. Contributing factors included the decision to discontinue certain products and customer relationships that did not fit the Company's long-term strategic plan, as well as depressed corporate capital spending. "I am very pleased with the performance of the ongoing business during the fourth quarter and our ability to meet our guidance in light of the soft market conditions, our exit from non-strategic businesses, and the divestiture itself," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. Fiscal 2003 Full Year Results For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $42.1 million, or $1.54 per share. This compares with a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.26 per share, reported last year. The net loss for 2003 includes a goodwill impairment charge of $34.8 million, net of tax, or $1.27 per share, which was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, related to the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Excluding discontinued operations, reorganization charges and goodwill impairment, pro-forma net loss for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 would have been $3.2 million, or $0.12 per share, and $2.6 million, or $0.10 per share, respectively. A reconciliation of the net loss reported for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 to the above pro-forma amounts is included as an attachment to this press release. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 were $1.2 billion, which is a decline of 9.5% compared with the $1.3 billion reported in fiscal 2002, primarily due to depressed capital spending. Business Outlook "As previously stated, I have five very specific goals for Pioneer-Standard," Rhein said. "We will grow sales faster than our markets; we will grow profits faster than sales; we will report operating profit of approximately 2.5% by the end of fiscal 2004 and 3%-3.5% for the longer term; we will drive our return on total capital to the 7%-9% range over the next 18 to 24 months, building to a sustainable 10%-12% long-term; and we will continue to opportunistically reduce our debt to achieve a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 25%-35%." Pioneer-Standard currently anticipates revenue growth of 3% to 6% in fiscal 2004, which ends March 31, 2004. The Company expects gross margins to approximate 13%, and operating expenses to be in the range of 10.5% to 11.0% of sales for the full year. Interest expense will be approximately $10.0 million for the year, assuming no additional debt reductions. The effective tax rate is expected to approximate 40% in fiscal 2004. As a result of these expectations, which do not include anticipated debt reductions in fiscal 2004, the Company is projecting net income of between $0.15 and $0.20 per share for the full fiscal year. The Company noted that any future debt reductions will favorably impact its current earnings outlook. "We also expect the second half of fiscal 2004 to be substantially stronger than the first half, much like fiscal 2003's seasonal second-half strength," noted Rhein. "Although the enterprise computer 5
systems business is less cyclical than the electronic components distribution business, it is typically more seasonal." The Company expects sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, ending June 30, 2003, to be flat to slightly higher than the $273.2 million reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Gross margins are anticipated to be approximately 13%. Operating expenses are anticipated to be between 11.8% and 12.2% of sales for the quarter, due to restructuring charges that will be recognized in the quarter, along with the normal seasonal sales trend. Net income is anticipated to be between break-even and a loss of $0.05 per share for the quarter ending June 30, 2003.

EXHIBIT INDEX 2

Exhibit 99.1 [Pioneer Standard Logo] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PIONEER-STANDARD ELECTRONICS REPORTS FISCAL 2004 FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS - - Sales Increase 2.3 Percent Over Last Year's First Quarter - - Net Loss of $0.05 Per Share in Line with Previously Announced Guidance - - Company Updates Full-Year Earnings Guidance Due to Purchase of Senior Notes CLEVELAND, Ohio - July 24, 2003 - Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIOS) today announced fiscal 2004 first-quarter sales of $280 million, an increase of 2.3 percent compared with first-quarter sales of $273 million last year. For the first quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per share, compared with a net loss of $34 million, or $1.25 per share in first quarter fiscal 2003. The Company's guidance for fiscal 2004 first quarter, issued on May 13, 2003, anticipated break-even to a loss of $0.05 per share for the quarter. Last year's first-quarter net loss included a charge of $34.8 million, net of tax, or $1.28 per share, related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. First-quarter operating income was $2.8 million, a 22 percent increase over $2.3 million for the first quarter last year. Included in fiscal 2004 first-quarter operating income are restructuring charges of approximately $463,000 related to facilities and other costs associated with the continuation of the Company's fiscal 2003 reorganization. "I am very pleased with the progress we have made in our initial quarter as a stand-alone enterprise computer solutions company, particularly in light of the difficult economic environment," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Following the divestiture of our electronic components business, we were able to grow sales, reduce costs and significantly improve operating income." The Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $708,000, net of tax, or $0.02 per share, in first quarter fiscal 2004, compared with $1.5 million, or $.05 per share in the first quarter last year. The Company also reported a loss from discontinued operations of $749,000, net of tax, or $0.03 per share, related to activities associated with the divestiture of the Company's electronic components distribution business. 3
BUSINESS OUTLOOK "Although our second quarter is generally our weakest, typically down from the first quarter, we expect fiscal 2004 second-quarter sales to be about the same level as the first quarter," said Rhein. "We continue to expect the second half of fiscal 2004 to be substantially stronger than the first half, which is consistent with historical trends." Consistent with the guidance provided on May 13, 2003, revenue is expected to grow between 3 percent and 6 percent for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004. For fiscal 2004, gross margin is expected to approximate 13 percent and selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be 10.5 percent to 11.0 percent of sales. Subsequent to June 30, 2003, the Company purchased an additional $28.0 million of its 9.5 percent senior notes, at approximately 111.66 percent of face value. The premium was approximately $3.3 million and will be reported in second-quarter 2004 results. In addition, interest expense is now expected to be approximately $8.7 million for fiscal 2004. Previously, the Company anticipated interest expense of approximately $10.0 million for the year. The net after tax impact of the senior note repurchase will decrease net income by approximately $1.2 million, or $0.04 per share for the year. The Company, therefore, now anticipates net income of $0.11 to $0.16 per share for fiscal 2004, excluding the impact of any further debt reductions. "As we execute our plan to grow Pioneer-Standard, our focus is to be the best at driving the adoption of enterprise computer solutions to satisfy the business needs of our customers," Rhein said. "We also intend to deliver industry-leading financial results, including improving our return on capital and reducing our debt, to benefit the Company and our shareholders over the long term."

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  October 30, 2003  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), formerly Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., today announced fiscal 2004 second-quarter sales of $293 million, an increase of 12.3 percent compared with second-quarter sales of $261 million last year. For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.12 per share, compared with net income of $642,000, or $0.02 per share, last year. Included in the fiscal 2004 second-quarter results is a loss from discontinued operations of $333,000 net of tax, or $0.01 per share, related to activities associated with the divestiture of the Company's electronic components distribution business. In last year's second quarter, the Company reported income from the same discontinued operations of $2.7 million net of tax, or $0.10 per share.
The 2004 second-quarter loss from continuing operations of $3.0 million, or $0.11 per share, includes charges for retirement of debt, restructuring, and a gain on the sale of an investment. The loss on retirement of debt of $3.4 million ($2.0 million net of tax, or $0.07 per share) relates to the previously announced purchase of an additional $28.5 million of the Company's 9.5 percent Senior Notes. The restructuring charges of $731,000 ($471,000 net of tax, or $0.02 per share) relate to facilities and other costs associated with the Company's fiscal 2003 reorganization. In addition, the Company sold its interest in Eurodis Electron PLC during the second quarter and recorded a gain of approximately $900,000, or $0.02 per share on the transaction. On a comparable basis, excluding these items, the loss from continuing operations would have been $0.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.08 per share last year.
"Typically our second-quarter sales are down from the first quarter, due to the seasonal nature of the business," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "With that in mind, we are very pleased with the strong sales growth of nearly 5 percent over last quarter and 12 percent over last year. This quarter's performance, coupled with the recent name change and the Kyrus acquisition, demonstrates the aggressive strides we are taking in repositioning the Company as we pursue our plans to grow in the enterprise computer solutions market."
Six Month Results
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, sales were $572.3 million, a 7.2 percent increase from sales of $533.9 million reported for the same period last year. The Company recorded a net loss for the six months of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a loss of $33.3 million, or $1.22 per share last year. In last year's first half, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective April 1, 2003. As a result of this new rule, Agilysys recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of $34.8 million net of tax, or $1.28 per share, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
 
Acquisition of Kyrus Corporation
Effective September 30, 2003, Agilysys, Inc. acquired Kyrus Corporation, a privately held provider of retail solutions and services, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. The purchase price of $28.7 million, including assumption of debt, was funded by cash. Agilysys is now the largest provider of IBM retail store solutions, offering hardware and software products that ensure continuous retail operations, as well as an extensive professional services organization with technology consulting, software customization, staging, implementation, hardware and software maintenance, and 24/7 support service capabilities. Agilysys assumed and retired all of Kyrus' existing debt of $18.4 million.
Integration of Kyrus' operations into Agilysys is being executed swiftly. Since the close of the transaction, Kyrus' inventory has been transferred to Agilysys' warehouses and all products are now being shipped and billed by Agilysys' facilities. The supply chain and financial processes have been transitioned to Agilysys' systems. Headcount overlap is being eliminated and redundant Kyrus facilities will be closed. The integration is expected to be complete by the end of calendar year 2003.
Business Outlook
For the fiscal 2004 third quarter ending December 31, 2003 the Company expects sales to increase 45 percent to 50 percent over the fiscal 2004 second-quarter sales of $293 million.
Based on Kyrus' anticipated annual sales of $130 million, combined with synergies between the two organizations, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to fiscal 2004 earnings per share. Management currently anticipates that Kyrus will add incremental sales of $65 million to $75 million to the balance of fiscal 2004. The acquisition is anticipated to add between $0.05 and $0.07 per share to net income for the fiscal third quarter, and break even in Agilysys' fiscal fourth quarter, thus reflecting the seasonal nature of its business.
Management currently estimates that sales for fiscal year 2004, including Kyrus operations, will increase between 15 percent and 20 percent compared with sales for fiscal 2003 of $1.2 billion. Gross margins are now expected to be between 12 percent and 12.5 percent of sales for the full year. Operating expenses are anticipated to be between 10 percent and 10.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2004. With the acquisition of Kyrus, the Company's fiscal 2004 earnings guidance is being updated to $0.16 to $0.20 per share, compared with the Company's previous guidance of $0.11 to $0.16 per share, issued on July 24, 2003, prior to the Kyrus acquisition.

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On February 2, 2004, Agilysys, Inc. issued a press release announcing its Fiscal 2004 third-quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  February 2, 2004  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer solutions, today announced sales of $459.4 million for the fiscal 2004 third quarter ended December 31, 2003. Sales in the quarter increased 22 percent compared with sales of $376.4 million for the third quarter last year, and increased 57 percent sequentially compared with sales of $292.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating income for the quarter of $20.2 million increased 153 percent over last year and represented 4.4 percent of sales compared with 2.1 percent a year ago.
For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $8.7 million, or $0.31 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.9 million, or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted), a year ago. The improved earnings are at the high end of the guidance issued by the Company on January 15, 2004, which anticipated earnings in the range of $0.29 to $0.31 per basic share, and $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share.
Included in the fiscal 2004 third-quarter results is a restructuring charge of $860,000 related to costs associated with the Company's fiscal 2003 reorganization. The Company also reported a charge of $712,000 representing the premium paid and the deferred costs written off upon the repurchase of $10.2 million of the Company's 9.5 percent Senior Notes. For the quarter, Agilysys reported income from continuing operations of $9.1 million, or $0.29 per share, an increase of nearly 300 percent compared with $2.3 million, or $0.08 per share, last year.
"I am very pleased with our third-quarter results and the excellent job our team did in effectively managing the business," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The strong performance across all customer segments was above and beyond the strength we typically see in our third quarter, which historically has been our strongest due to the seasonal nature of our business. In addition, during the quarter we benefited from the positive contribution of our recent acquisition of the Kyrus Corporation."
The Company noted that the Kyrus operations, acquired September 30, 2003, were quickly integrated and contributed sales of $29.7 million and operating income of $1.4 million in the third quarter.
"We have taken Kyrus from operating at a loss to turning a profit in just one quarter," said Rhein. The Company noted that, while the Kyrus acquisition added nearly $4.5 million to operating expenses in the third quarter, Agilysys expects to reduce those costs by nearly 25 percent in the fourth quarter as it continues to streamline the business.
 
During the quarter, the Company reported a loss from discontinued operations of $458,000, net of tax, or $0.01 per share, compared with a loss from discontinued operations of $426,000, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter. The loss from discontinued operations in both years is related to activities associated with the fiscal 2003 divestiture of the Company's electronic components distribution business.
Nine-Month Results
For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, sales were $1.0 billion, a 13.3 percent increase from sales of $910.3 million reported for the same period last year. The Company recorded net income for the nine months of $3.8 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with a net loss of $31.4 million, or $1.15 per share, last year. Included in last year's first nine months was a charge of $34.8 million, net of tax, or $1.27 per share, for the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective April 1, 2003, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
"I believe our strong results are an early indication that our strategy of focusing solely on enterprise computer solutions is gaining momentum and the marketplace is responding to us as a valued partner," said Rhein.
Acquisition of Inter-American Data, Inc.
On February 2, 2004, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Inter-American Data, Inc. (IAD), a leading developer and provider of software and services to hotel casinos and major resorts throughout the United States. IAD powers some of the largest resorts in the world with a robust suite of enterprise solutions for property and materials management as well as electronic document storage. The privately held, Atlanta-based company had revenues of approximately $40 million in 2003.
The purchase price of $36.5 million will be funded with cash and will result in goodwill of approximately $36 million. The acquisition, which is expected to be slightly accretive to fiscal 2004 earnings per share, is anticipated to close on or around February 18, 2004, subject to, among other things, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
With this acquisition, Agilysys becomes a leading software developer and service provider to the hospitality industry, particularly the gaming sector, which is an area of the economy that has experienced growth in recent years. Similar to its recent acquisition of Kyrus, the addition of IAD will allow Agilysys access to a new market, broaden its customer base, and increase its service and product offerings.
IAD solutions run on IBM platforms, and are selected for reliability, performance and minimizing system failure at major casinos and resorts. IAD is the market leader in property management systems (PMS) solutions purchased by resort properties in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, the two largest gaming centers in the United States. Most of the major hotel casinos and many of the largest resorts have retained IAD to design, implement and support their PMS for the hotel front office, management accounting, customer service, and housekeeping functions.
 
Business Outlook
"When we repositioned the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2004, we established several ambitious goals including growing sales faster than the market, growing profits faster than sales, and achieving operating profit margins in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 percent by the end of the fiscal year, as well as driving our return on capital to 7 to 9 percent over the next 18 to 24 months," said Rhein. "I am pleased to report that, at the end of the first nine months, we are clearly on track to meet or exceed these goals."
The Company currently estimates that sales for fiscal 2004 will increase between 16 and 18 percent compared with sales for fiscal 2003 of $1.2 billion. Gross margin is now expected to be between 12.2 percent and 12.5 percent of sales for the full year. Operating expenses are anticipated to be approximately 10 percent of sales for fiscal 2004. The Company's fiscal 2004 full-year earnings guidance is in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share.
Conference Call Information
A conference call to discuss quarterly results is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Monday, February 2, 2004. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the Company's Web site: www.agilysys.com.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND, Ohio  May 12, 2004  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced its fiscal 2004 fourth-quarter and full-year results for the periods ended March 31, 2004. The Company reported fourth quarter net income of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $10.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter income from continuing operations was $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. This compares with a fourth quarter loss from continuing operations in the previous year of $24.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share.
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 42 percent to $371.6 million compared with sales of $261.3 million for the fourth quarter last year. Gross margin for the quarter was 13.9 percent, up from 13.2 percent reported for the fourth quarter in the previous year.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "We experienced strong sales performance across all customer segments, well beyond the strength we typically see in our fourth quarter. The overall increase in gross margin percentage was driven by the higher gross margin contributions of our recent acquisitions. The Agilysys team continues to do an excellent job of effectively managing the business."
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 10.8 percent from 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of the previous year. This was primarily due to effective cost management and the increased year-over-year sales level.
During the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.0 million resulting from the settlement of an outstanding lawsuit. The gain is included in "Other (Income) Expense" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, Agilysys recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 relating to the repurchase of an additional $32.9 million of the Company's 9.5 percent Senior Notes.
Agilysys results also benefited from the acquisition and successful integration of the Kyrus Corporation and Inter-American Data, Inc. (IAD). During the fourth quarter of 2004 the two acquisitions contributed $38.4 million to sales and $7.3 million to gross margin.
Recent Acquisitions Contribute to Improved Operating Results
Rhein said, "The contributions of our recent acquisitions are encouraging, particularly when one
 
considers our quarter's results include only six weeks of operations from the IAD business. I am also pleased with the swift integration of both Kyrus and IAD. We expect both acquisitions to continue their strong performance and positively impact the profitability of the business."
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of 20 percent, compared with the $1.2 billion in sales reported for the prior year.
Fiscal 2004 Full-Year Results
Gross margin for the current fiscal year was 12.9 percent, up from 12.7 percent in fiscal 2003.
Agilysys also reported an improvement in the 2004 fiscal year's selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to 10.1 percent, from 11.6 percent in fiscal 2003.
Net income increased to $8.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $42.1 million, or $1.54 per diluted share last year. Included in last year's results was a charge of $34.8 million, net of tax, or $1.27 per diluted share, related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective April 1, 2003, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
"At the beginning of fiscal 2004, Agilysys established several ambitious goals including growing sales faster than the market, growing profits faster than sales, and achieving operating profit margins in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 percent by the end of the fiscal year, as well as driving our return on invested capital to 7 to 9 percent over a 18 to 24 month period," said Rhein. "Today, we reported results that demonstrate that we have exceeded each of these goals. Our accomplishments during the fiscal year also position the Company to continue achieving impressive sales and profit growth in fiscal 2005 and beyond."
For fiscal 2005, the Company currently estimates sales to grow between 13 and 18 percent over fiscal 2004 sales of $1.4 billion. Full-year gross margin is expected to be between 12.8 percent and 13.1 percent.
Business Outlook
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to remain at approximately 10 percent of sales for fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 net income is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share.
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2005 capital expenditures between $2 and $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.2 million and interest expense, net of interest income, of approximately $5.5 million, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company expects sales to grow by 28 to 32 percent over the comparable quarter last year.
A conference call to discuss the quarterly and full-year results is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12, 2004. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the Company's Web site: www.agilysys.com.

Amended Information
This Form 8-K/A revises the Company's Form 8-K dated October 30, 2003, by clarifying the use of a non-GAAP financial measure therein. The clarification regarding the non-GAAP measure is provided under the heading "under this Item 12 and continues until immediately above the signature block. Only the information and disclosure for the purpose of clarifying the use of the non-GAAP financial measure has been amended. No attempt has been made in this amendment to modify or update other disclosures presented in the original report on the Form 8-K. This Form 8-K/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the original Form 8-K or modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events. Accordingly, the Form 8-K/A should be read in conjunction with the Company's filings made subsequent to the filing of the original Form 8-K. Consequently, all other information remains unchanged and reflects the disclosures made at the time of the original filing of the Form 8-K on October 30, 2003.
Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information"
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 30, 2003, Agilysys, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for its Fiscal 2004 second quarter ended September 30, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial information relating to operating income, income and income per basic and diluted share, each as adjusted for certain charges and losses that the Company believes impact the comparability of its results of operations. These charges and losses arise out of the prepayment of debt, restructuring activities and the sale of an investment in an affiliated company. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial information to GAAP are set forth in the table below.
The Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist them in assessing and understanding its operating performance and underlying trends in the Company's business because management considers the charges and losses referred to above to be outside the Company's core operating results. Management uses this non-GAAP financial information as one of a number of primary indicators for evaluating the Company's financial and operating performance. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors uses this non-GAAP financial information in evaluating management performance.
The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or alternative to, operating income, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per basic and diluted share determined in accordance with GAAP. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.
SIGNATURE
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  October 30, 2003  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), formerly Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., today announced fiscal 2004 second-quarter sales of $293 million, an increase of 12.3 percent compared with second-quarter sales of $261 million last year. For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.12 per share, compared with net income of $642,000, or $0.02 per share, last year. Included in the fiscal 2004 second-quarter results is a loss from discontinued operations of $333,000 net of tax, or $0.01 per share, related to activities associated with the divestiture of the Company's electronic components distribution business. In last year's second quarter, the Company reported income from the same discontinued operations of $2.7 million net of tax, or $0.10 per share.
The 2004 second-quarter loss from continuing operations of $3.0 million, or $0.11 per share, includes charges for retirement of debt, restructuring, and a gain on the sale of an investment. The loss on retirement of debt of $3.4 million ($2.0 million net of tax, or $0.07 per share) relates to the previously announced purchase of an additional $28.5 million of the Company's 9.5 percent Senior Notes. The restructuring charges of $731,000 ($471,000 net of tax, or $0.02 per share) relate to facilities and other costs associated with the Company's fiscal 2003 reorganization. In addition, the Company sold its interest in Eurodis Electron PLC during the second quarter and recorded a gain of approximately $900,000, or $0.02 per share on the transaction. On a comparable basis, excluding these items, the loss from continuing operations would have been $0.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.08 per share last year.
"Typically our second-quarter sales are down from the first quarter, due to the seasonal nature of the business," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "With that in mind, we are very pleased with the strong sales growth of nearly 5 percent over last quarter and 12 percent over last year. This quarter's performance, coupled with the recent name change and the Kyrus acquisition, demonstrates the aggressive strides we are taking in repositioning the Company as we pursue our plans to grow in the enterprise computer solutions market."
Six Month Results
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, sales were $572.3 million, a 7.2 percent increase from sales of $533.9 million reported for the same period last year. The Company recorded a net loss for the six months of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a loss of $33.3 million, or $1.22 per share last year. In last year's first half, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective April 1, 2003. As a result of this new rule, Agilysys recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of $34.8 million net of tax, or $1.28 per share, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
 
Acquisition of Kyrus Corporation
Effective September 30, 2003, Agilysys, Inc. acquired Kyrus Corporation, a privately held provider of retail solutions and services, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. The purchase price of $28.7 million, including assumption of debt, was funded by cash. Agilysys is now the largest provider of IBM retail store solutions, offering hardware and software products that ensure continuous retail operations, as well as an extensive professional services organization with technology consulting, software customization, staging, implementation, hardware and software maintenance, and 24/7 support service capabilities. Agilysys assumed and retired all of Kyrus' existing debt of $18.4 million.
Integration of Kyrus' operations into Agilysys is being executed swiftly. Since the close of the transaction, Kyrus' inventory has been transferred to Agilysys' warehouses and all products are now being shipped and billed by Agilysys' facilities. The supply chain and financial processes have been transitioned to Agilysys' systems. Headcount overlap is being eliminated and redundant Kyrus facilities will be closed. The integration is expected to be complete by the end of calendar year 2003.
Business Outlook
For the fiscal 2004 third quarter ending December 31, 2003 the Company expects sales to increase 45 percent to 50 percent over the fiscal 2004 second-quarter sales of $293 million.
Based on Kyrus' anticipated annual sales of $130 million, combined with synergies between the two organizations, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to fiscal 2004 earnings per share. Management currently anticipates that Kyrus will add incremental sales of $65 million to $75 million to the balance of fiscal 2004. The acquisition is anticipated to add between $0.05 and $0.07 per share to net income for the fiscal third quarter, and break even in Agilysys' fiscal fourth quarter, thus reflecting the seasonal nature of its business.
Management currently estimates that sales for fiscal year 2004, including Kyrus operations, will increase between 15 percent and 20 percent compared with sales for fiscal 2003 of $1.2 billion. Gross margins are now expected to be between 12 percent and 12.5 percent of sales for the full year. Operating expenses are anticipated to be between 10 percent and 10.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2004. With the acquisition of Kyrus, the Company's fiscal 2004 earnings guidance is being updated to $0.16 to $0.20 per share, compared with the Company's previous guidance of $0.11 to $0.16 per share, issued on July 24, 2003, prior to the Kyrus acquisition.
Conference Call Information
A conference call to discuss quarterly results is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 30, 2003. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the Company's Web site: www.agilysys.com.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, Ohio  July 26, 2004  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced its fiscal 2005 first-quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2004. For the first quarter, the Company reported sales increased 38 percent to $386.7 million compared with $279.6 million for the first quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $3.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter last year. The Company also raised its guidance for fiscal 2005, now expecting annual sales to increase 20 to 25 percent over fiscal 2004, with earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.93 per diluted share.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "During the first quarter Agilysys continued to aggressively market its products and services in an improving information technology spending environment, which resulted in an outstanding sales performance. Our strong performance in the quarter and pipeline of sales opportunities position us well to achieve our increased sales and net income expectations."
Gross margin for the quarter was 12.6 percent, compared with 12.5 percent reported for the first quarter in the previous year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 10.1 percent from 11.3 percent in the first quarter of the previous year. This was primarily due to continued cost containment and the increased year-over-year sales level.
Because of its first-quarter performance and positive outlook, Agilysys is updating its previously announced expectations for fiscal 2005. The Company now anticipates sales to grow between 20 and 25 percent over fiscal 2004 sales of $1.4 billion. Agilysys said full-year gross margin is expected to be closer to the lower end of the Company's original fiscal 2005 guidance of 12.8 to 13.1 percent of sales.
Company Updates Fiscal 2005 Business Outlook
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2005. Net income for the full fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.93 per diluted share.
Agilysys also said it now expects to incur fiscal 2005 capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.2 million and interest expense, net of interest income, of approximately $5.5 million, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  November 2, 2004  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced its fiscal 2005 second-quarter and first half results for the period ended September 30, 2004. For the quarter, the company's sales increased 25 percent to $364.4 million compared with $292.7 million for the second quarter last year. Gross margin rose to 13.3 percent of sales from 11.9 percent in the prior year. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $3.4 million, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share in the second quarter last year.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "Agilysys continues to have strong performance across all areas of its business. In addition, the acquisitions we made last year are contributing to our results, particularly by improving gross margins."
Rhein also said, "Solid execution driving continued market share gains are expected to result in the company achieving its previously announced fiscal year sales and earnings expectations."
For the six months ended September 30, 2004, sales were $751.1 million, a 31.2 percent increase over sales of $572.3 million reported for the same period last year. The company recorded net income for the six months of $7.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share last year.
Six Months Results
Agilysys said based on current business trends it is maintaining previous guidance of sales growth between 20 and 25 percent over fiscal 2004 sales of $1.4 billion. Full-year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 12.8 to 13.1 percent of sales.
Fiscal 2005 Business Outlook
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2005. Net income expectations for the full fiscal year remain in the range of $0.83 to $0.93 per diluted share.
Agilysys also said it expects to incur fiscal 2005 capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $11.7 million and interest expense, net of interest income, of approximately $4.5 million, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  April 1, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, announced today that Dr. Curtis J. Crawford has been appointed to its nine-member board of directors, effective April 1, 2005. Crawford, 57, will succeed James L. Bayman, 68, who will retire April 1, 2005 after 23 years of service on the board.
Bayman, a 33-year veteran with the company, was chairman of the Agilysys board from April 1995 through April 2003, chief executive officer from April 1995 to March 2002 and president of the company from June 1984 to April 1997. "On behalf of the board and the entire management team, I would like to thank Jim for his years of dedicated service and leadership to Agilysys," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We appreciate his many contributions and wish him much success in his future endeavors."
Crawford currently serves as president and chief executive officer of XCEO, Inc., a company he founded that provides counseling and coaching services to chief executives and other senior officers on leadership and corporate governance. Prior to founding XCEO, he was president and chief executive officer of Onix Microsystems. From 1998 to 2001, Crawford was president and chief executive officer of ZiLOG Incorporated. Over his career, he has held numerous leadership positions including vice president of marketing with IBM; president of AT&T Microelectronics, a business unit of AT&T Corporation; and group president of the microelectronics group; and president of the intellectual property division of Lucent Technologies. He currently serves on the boards of ITT Industries, Inc.; E.I. du Pont Nemours and Company; and ON Semiconductor where, as chairman of the board from September 1999 until April 2002, he played a significant role in the company's successful initial public offering.
"Curtis is a proven leader with more than 30 years of experience in the computer and semiconductor industries. As a corporate officer and director of several public companies, he has been a strong advocate of customer-driven, systems-level approaches to the electronics business," said Rhein. "I am confident that his industry knowledge and business acumen will further broaden the board's strategic and governance prowess."
A graduate of Governors State University in University Park, Illinois, Crawford received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration and Computer Sciences and a Master of Arts degree in Marketing. He received a Master of Business Administration degree from the Charles H. Kellstadt Graduate School of Business at DePaul University. Crawford received his Doctorate of Philosophy Degree in Organization and Management from the Graduate School of Capella University.

One was received from Governors State University in June of 1996 and one was received from the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications and Information Services (CTI) at DePaul University in June of 1999.
Crawford will serve the balance of Bayman's current term, which will expire at the company's annual meeting of shareholders in July 2005. It is currently the intention of the Board to nominate Crawford for re-election at the 2005 annual meeting.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  April 20, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer solutions, today announced that it anticipates fiscal 2005 sales of approximately $1.62 billion, or 16 percent growth over the prior year, and fiscal 2005 earnings between $0.70 and $0.74 per diluted share versus $0.31 for fiscal 2004. This update compares with previous fiscal 2005 guidance of approximately 20 percent sales growth and anticipated earnings of $0.90 to $0.93 per share for fiscal 2005.
The Company stated that weaker than forecasted fourth quarter sales were largely due to lower than expected sales volumes in its distribution channel, KeyLink Systems, which generates most of its revenues from the sale of IBM enterprise hardware and software products. Fourth quarter softness in sales was also experienced in the company's enterprise solutions group. As a result of the significantly weaker sales volume and lower than expected supplier incentives, overall gross margins and profitability were negatively impacted.
Arthur Rhein, Agilysys chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "This is the first time I can recall that the strength in sales volume we typically experience in the final weeks of a quarter didn't materialize. Despite my disappointment with what I currently believe was an abnormally soft fourth quarter and with our results for the quarter, I am pleased with our full-year performance and the improvement over the prior year."
Agilysys will issue fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full year earnings on Tuesday, May 10, 2005 and hold a conference call to discuss the results and fiscal 2006 expectations at 11 a.m. ET. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: www.agilysys.com.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition; and Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 10, 2005 Agilysys, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, Ohio  May 10, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced fiscal 2005 unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year results for the periods ended March 31, 2005.
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were $356.4 million, a decrease of four percent compared with sales of $371.6 million for the fourth quarter last year. As previously announced, weaker than forecasted fourth quarter sales were largely due to lower than expected sales volumes in the company's distribution channel, which generates most of its revenues from the sale of IBM enterprise hardware. Softness in sales was also experienced in the company's enterprise solutions channel. As a result, the company received lower than expected supplier incentives and generated less gross margin dollars, which negatively impacted profitability.
Fourth quarter sales of hardware products were $292.0 million, down 4.0 percent from $304.1 million last year. Software sales were $44.9 million, down 6.6 percent, from $48.1 million a year ago. Services sales were $19.5 million, up 0.7 percent, from $19.4 million last year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 12.8 percent as compared with 13.9 percent for the fourth quarter last year. This lower gross margin was essentially due to lower incentives on Intel architecture-based hardware products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $43.5 million, or 12.2 percent of sales compared with $40.5 million, or 10.9 percent of sales in the prior year. Current year expense levels were negatively impacted by a one-time adjustment to employee benefit plans, as well as higher levels of professional fees in the fourth quarter, most of which will not recur in fiscal 2006.
Agilysys results include an effective tax rate of 60.4 percent for the fourth quarter. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2005 has been determined to be 39 percent of income before taxes. The company previously estimated a 37.5 percent rate. As a result, a cumulative adjustment was recorded in the fourth quarter.
The company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $230,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year.
Cash flow from operations was $31.8 million in the quarter, compared with $59.6 million in the fourth quarter last year.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 sales were $1.62 billion, an increase of 16 percent over the $1.40 billion in sales reported for the prior year.
Fiscal 2005 Full-Year Results
 
Full year sales of hardware products were $1.32 billion, up 16.5 percent year over year. Software sales were $221.7 million, up 4.6 percent. Services sales were $79.4 million, up 40.5 percent.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "Despite a disappointing performance in the fourth quarter, I am pleased that for the full year Agilysys grew sales 16 percent, faster than the market, and grew net income 149 percent from the previous year. In addition, the company generated $91.9 million in cash flow from continuing operations for the year."
Gross margin for the current fiscal year was 12.8 percent, down from 12.9 percent in fiscal 2004.
Agilysys also reported an improvement in the 2005 fiscal year's selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to 9.9 percent, from 10.1 percent in fiscal 2004.
Net income increased to $21.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of $8.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share last year. Included in last year's results was a restructuring charge of $2.5 million, as well as a $7.9 million loss on the retirement of debt.
For fiscal 2006, the company currently estimates sales to grow between five and seven percent over fiscal 2005 sales of $1.62 billion.
Business Outlook
Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 12.4 percent of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2006, as a result of cost control and greater operating leverage from higher sales volumes. Fiscal 2006 net income is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.88 per diluted share.
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2006 capital expenditures between $2 and $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million and interest expense will be offset by interest income, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.
A conference call to discuss the quarterly and full-year results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday, May 10, 2005. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  May 16, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced that it is exercising its option to cause the redemption of approximately $125.3 million of 6.75% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities ("Trust Preferred Securities"). The Redemption Date will be June 15, 2005. The redemption will be funded by existing cash balances, and will include accrued interest through June 15, 2005.
Holders of Trust Preferred Securities will be required to accept the cash payment of $51.72 for each Trust Preferred Security or convert the Trust Preferred Securities into common shares of Agilysys by the Redemption Date. The conversion rate is 3.1746 common shares for each Trust Preferred Security, or the equivalent of $15.75 per common share.
The redemption of the remaining Trust Preferred Securities is part of the company's strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value. In addition to improving the balance sheet, Agilysys will also benefit by eliminating its annual distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities, which amount to approximately $5.2 million annually, net of tax, and will eliminate potential dilution of up to 8 million shares, should all the Trust Preferred Securities be redeemed for cash.
The Trust Preferred Securities were originally offered in March 1998. Holders will receive an official redemption notice with appropriate instructions from the Trustee, Wilmington Trust. Holders with questions should contact Wilmington Trust at (302) 636-6016.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 10.1
     THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT ("Amendment") by and between Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., now known as Agilysys, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and Martin F. Ellis ("Employee"), is dated as of the 28 day of April, 2005.
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee are parties to a Change of Control Agreement dated as of June 30, 2003 (the "Change of Control Agreement"); and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee desire that certain modifications be made to the Change of Control Agreement;
     WHEREAS, Section 8(c) of the Change of Control Agreement permits the parties thereto to amend such agreement, respectively, in a writing signed by each party.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the parties' mutual desire to modify the Change of Control Agreement, the parties agree as follows effective as of the date of execution of this Agreement:
     1. This Amendment shall amend the terms of the Change of Control Agreement as set forth herein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Change of Control Agreement.
     2. Section 3.1 of the Agreement shall deleted, and the following shall be inserted therefore:
     3.1 . If, at any time prior to the date that is twelve (12) months subsequent to the Effective Date, the Employee's employment with the Company shall be terminated either (i) by the Company without Cause, or (ii) by the Employee for Good Reason, as provided in Section 3.4, below:
Without Cause or for Good Reason
                (a) the Company shall pay to the Employee within thirty (30) days of the date of termination a lump sum amount equal to twenty-four (24) times the greater of the Employee's (i) highest monthly base salary paid or payable by the Company during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Effective Date, or (ii) the highest monthly salary paid or payable by the Company at any time from the ninety (90) day period preceding the Effective Date through the date of termination (the "Highest Base Salary"); and
                (b) the Company shall pay to the Employee within thirty (30) days of the date of termination a lump sum amount equal to two (2) times the annual incentive plan ("AIP") target applicable to Employee at the time of termination; and
                (c) the Company shall pay to the Employee within thirty (30) days of the date of termination a lump sum amount equal to twenty-four (24) times the monthly amount paid
 
or payable to Employee by the Company as an auto allowance as in effect immediately preceding the Effective Date; and
                (d) for the twenty-four (24) month period following the date of termination (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the Company shall continue to provide health insurance and retirement benefits to the Employee and/or the Employee's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them if the Employee's employment had not been terminated, in accordance with the most favorable plans, practices, programs or policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Employee, as in effect at any time thereafter with respect to other key employees and their families, and for purposes of eligibility for retirement benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Employee shall be considered to have remained employed until the end of the Benefits Continuation Period and to have retired on the last day of such period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee shall have no right to participate in any incentive compensation plan of the Company subsequent to the date of termination; and
                (e) if it would be illegal to provide the benefits under such plans, practices, programs or policies referred to in Section 3.1(d) above due to, among other things, nondiscrimination rules or tax qualification rules applicable to such plans, practices, programs or policies, then the Company will be deemed to be in compliance with this Agreement if it provides such Employee with a comparable substitute therefor, provided the Employee and the Employee's dependents are placed thereby in the same or a better economic position than if the Company provided such benefits through its then existing plans, practices, programs or policies.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment No. 1 to Change of Control Agreement as of the date first above written.

 
Exhibit 10.2
     IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the individual named above ("Employee") hereby agrees as follows:
1. . Agilysys, Inc. ("the Company") shall employ Employee in the position set forth above, with duties and responsibilities to be determined by the Company. The Company reserves the right to add to, subtract from, or otherwise change these duties, and to reassign Employee or change his/her title consistent with its business judgment of the best interests of the Company.
Position
Employee shall use his or her best efforts at all times to promote, protect, and advance the best interests of the Company. Employee will devote his or her entire business time and attention to the Company, and will not promote the business or products of any other company or engage in any outside business activity without the prior written consent of the Company during his or her employment with the Company.
2. . Employee shall be compensated as deemed appropriate by the Company's management. His/her salary and/or incentive pay shall be reviewed regularly and shall be subject to increases or decreases consistent with the Company's assessments of performance, relative contribution, and/or the particular business conditions of the Company. Employee shall be eligible as per eligibility requirements and other plan provisions to participate in any and all employee benefit plans made available from time to time to the Company's employees.
Compensation
3. . Employee may terminate this Agreement at any time and such termination shall be effective on the date of his or her notice, unless otherwise mutually agreed. Similarly, the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment at any time, with or without advance notice or cause. Should the Company terminate the Employee's employment without cause, the Company will continue to pay the employee monthly base salary, target incentive and medical coverage for twelve (12) months (the "severance payments"). In the event that (1) employee's employment is terminated for cause or (2) employee voluntarily resigns from employment with the company, then the company shall have no obligation for severance payments under this provision. Absolutely no one except the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company may change this "at will" relationship, and then only in writing. Employee acknowledges that any reliance on any representations, oral or otherwise, contrary to "at will" employment is unreasonable and shall not form the basis for any actions or forbearances on his or her part.
Duration
4. . Employee agrees at all times to hold as secret and confidential any and all knowledge, technical information, business information, developments, trade secrets, know-how and confidences of the Company and of any third party who has entrusted its own such information to the Company, including, but not limited to, the following:
Nondisclosure
(a) any formula, pattern, device, plan, drawing, technical information, blueprint, data, diagram, model, specification, computer program, process or compilation of same which is, or is designed to be, used in the business of the Company or results from its activities;
(b) all business plans and/or strategies, financial information, customer and sales information, price lists, vendor information, cost information, and personnel information; and
(c) ideas, inventions, discoveries, and improvements, whether or not patentable, belonging to the Company or which Employee conceives or makes, alone or with others, during or relating to his/her employment with the Company, and which were made partially or wholly with the use of equipment, supplies, facilities or information of the Company, or were developed partially or wholly on the Company's time (collectively, "Confidential Information"). Employee agrees not to use this Confidential Information for his/her own benefit or for the benefit of others (except as Company duties may require) either during or after employment with the Company without prior written consent from the Company. Further, Employee agrees not to remove or aid in the removal from the premises of the Company such Confidential Information or any property or material which relates thereto. Unauthorized removal of Confidential Information will lead to appropriate discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
Upon Employee's separation from employment with the Company, Employee agrees to return and deliver to the Company all notes, notebooks, drawings, blueprints, customer and sales information, and all other Confidential Information, together with copies, compilations, and
 
summaries of same, which are in his/her possession or under his/her control.
5. . For purposes of this Agreement, "Noncompetition Period" shall refer to the 2-year period commencing on the effective date of termination of Employee's employment with the Company for any reason.
Noncompetition
(a) . Employee agrees that, in the event that he/she: (1) voluntarily resigns from employment with the Company; or (2) is terminated for cause from employment with the Company, he/she will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, be employed by, own, manage, operate, or control, or participate, directly or indirectly, in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or be connected with (whether as a director, officer, employee, partner, consultant, or otherwise), any business which competes with the business of the Company, including but not limited to the sale of information technology products and services, enterprise computer systems, and related consulting, integration, maintenance and professional services (the "Non-competition Obligation.")
Voluntary Termination and Termination for Cause
(b) . In the event that Employee's employment is terminated without cause, the Company shall have the option to pay to Employee his regular base and target incentive salary consistent with regular payroll practices (the "Noncompetition Payments") for all or any part of the Noncompetition Period. If the Company elects to make Noncompetition Payments to Employee, then Employee will be bound by the Noncompetition Obligation set forth in Subparagraph A, above, for the duration of Noncompetition Payments. All decision as to: (1) whether to make Noncompetition Payments to Employee; and (2) the duration of the Noncompetition Payments, shall be within the sole discretion of the Company, and will be communicated to Employee at the time of termination. It is acknowledged and understood that any Noncompetition Payments made hereunder are in addition to, and independent of, any Severance Payments under Paragraph 3, above and constitutes adequate consideration for the Noncompetition objectives set forth herein. It is further acknowledged and understood that any Noncompetition Obligation arising under this Subparagraph shall be in addition to any other obligations on the part of Employee under this Agreement, including but not limited to, his/her nondisclosure and nonsolicitation obligations.
Termination Without Cause
6. . Employee further agrees that he/she will not at any time during the Noncompetition Period, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly solicit or induce, attempt to solicit or induce, or aid or assist in the solicitation or inducement of any employee, agent, other representative or associate of the Company, vendor, and/or supplier to terminate his, her, or its relationship with the Company.
Nonsolicitation/Noninterference
7. . Employee specifically acknowledges that the covenants set forth in paragraphs four (4), five (5), and six (6) hereof are reasonable and necessary in view of the nature of the relationship between Employee and the Company and Employee's access to the Company's Confidential Information in regard to his/her employment with the Company. Employee warrants and represents that, in the event that the restrictions set forth in these paragraphs become operative, he/she will be able to engage in other activities for the purpose of earning a livelihood. Employee acknowledges that any breach of any of these paragraphs will cause the Company immediate irreparable harm and hereby consents to injunctive relief for any actual or threatened breach. Should the Company succeed in any regard in enforcing any of the restrictive covenants set forth, the Employee agrees to pay all expenses and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company in any enforcement proceeding.
Acknowledgment
Employee acknowledges that the covenants of paragraphs four (4), five (5), and six (6) hereof are of the essence of this Agreement. They shall be construed as independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any of these covenants.
8. . In the event that any of the paragraph(s) and/or provision(s) of this Agreement shall be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable as expressly written, such court shall reform such paragraph(s) and/or provision(s) to the end that Employee shall be subject to reasonable obligation(s) under the circumstances enforceable by the Company.
Reformation of Agreement; Severability
Should Employee be found to have been in breach of his/her noncompete and/or nonsolicitation/ noninterference obligations, the Court shall extend or revise the applicable restraint(s) so as to afford the Company the full period of restraint(s) contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that any paragraph(s) or provision(s) of this Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable to any extent for any reason, it is the agreed-upon intent of the parties hereto that all remaining paragraphs and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted and that this Agreement shall be enforceable as if such void or unenforceable paragraph(s) and/or provision(s) had never been a part hereof.
 
9. . Employee shall deliver a copy of this Agreement to each person, business, or entity with whom he/she seeks employment, partnership, or other business association at any time within two (2) years of separation from employment with the Company.
Disclosure of this Agreement
10. . This Agreement supersedes and replaces any existing agreement or understanding between Employee and the Company relating to the subject matters addressed herein. Employee and the Company recognize and agree that this is the entire agreement between them concerning the topics expressly addressed herein. Any modification of this Agreement must be in writing signed by both parties.
Entire Agreement
11. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding as to, the Company, its affiliated and/or related businesses, as well as to their successors and assigns.
Assignment
12. . This Agreement shall become effective as of the date set forth below and shall be governed by, and contained in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of the State of Ohio. Employee agrees that the state and federal courts located in the State of Ohio shall have jurisdiction in any action, suit or proceeding against Employee based on or arising out of this Agreement and Employee hereby: (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to service of process in connection with any action, suit or proceeding against Employee; and (c) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction, venue or service of process.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  June 3, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced that Martin F. Ellis, executive vice president, corporate development and investor relations, will assume the role of chief financial officer as part of a senior management realignment and consolidation of responsibilities, effective immediately.
Ellis, 40, whose new title will be executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, succeeds Steven Billick, who has served as treasurer and chief financial officer since joining the company, formerly Pioneer Standard Electronics, Inc., in April 2000. In his new position, Ellis will be responsible for the company's finance, treasury, investor relations and corporate development functions which include mergers and acquisitions. Billick will be leaving the company upon completion of a functional transition of responsibilities.
"Martin has demonstrated strong strategic leadership of corporate development and investor relations at Agilysys since joining the company in 2003," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "His extensive experience in U.S. and global financial markets uniquely qualifies him to serve as our chief financial officer as we pursue more profitable growth in our core businesses and key new markets. During the last two years, he has led the successful acquisitions of three new businesses positioning Agilysys for higher-margined growth in the retail, hotel casinos and resort industries, and further enhancing the Agilysys storage product and service offering.
"We also want to thank Steve for his contributions to Agilysys during this important period in the company's history," added Rhein.
Ellis, who will continue reporting to Rhein, joined the company in July 2003 from New York City-based Stern, Stewart & Co., a global financial consulting firm where he served as senior vice president and principal. While at Stern Stewart, Ellis managed the Corporate Finance Advisory and Middle Market EVA  (Economic Value Added) practice, where he advised clients on corporate and financial restructurings, including mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, and financial policy, strategies and recapitalizations. Prior to joining Stern Stewart, Ellis advised many companies on a variety of issues. With Zurich-based Fairchild Associates Ltd., he provided specialized consulting services to financial institutions. He spent two years in London with the Accounting Systems & Support Company, providing management and accounting services to small- and medium-sized companies. Prior to that, he practiced as a chartered accountant with Deloitte & Touche in Johannesburg, South Africa.
A native of South Africa, Ellis earned his Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of the Witwatersrand and an honors degree in accounting science from the University of South Africa. He received his MBA in finance from the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester.

As of the press release date, the Company's Form 10-K was expected to report fiscal 2005 fully diluted earnings per share of $0.70. The Company will also report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A copy of the press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  June 13, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced that it will file its fiscal 2005 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, June, 14, 2005. The company's Form 10-K will report fiscal 2005 fully diluted earnings per share of $0.70. The company will also report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
Agilysys stated that final audit adjustments will decrease fiscal 2005 net income by $0.02 to $0.70 per diluted share, compared with the $0.72 per diluted share previously reported in the company's unaudited earnings release issued May 10, 2005. The adjustment to earnings per share is primarily related to an accrual for a long-term incentive plan.
In its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, management identified as a material weakness inadequate controls over the vendor debit process. Vendor debits are transactional discounts on purchases from major suppliers. The vendor debit process is manually intensive and involves thousands of individual transactions. Management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, and they concur with management's findings.
Agilysys is in the process of remediating the weakness described above. Additional review and approval of the vendor debit process has been added to internal controls. In addition, management is evaluating all systems and procedures relative to the vendor debit process with the objective of implementing automated preventive controls and other process improvements in the near future.
Martin Ellis, Agilysys executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, said, "Agilysys is committed to implementation of systems and processes that best ensure the accuracy and integrity of our financial reporting. While we believe that the weakness we have identified has not materially impacted the accuracy of our reports, we will take this opportunity to address the accounting control issues raised in our review of the vendor debit process."
The company also notes that, as previously announced on May 16, 2005, it will cause redemption of its Convertible Trust Preferred Securities on June 15, 2005. Holders of the securities will be required to accept a cash payment of $51.72 for each Trust Preferred Security or convert the Trust Preferred Securities into common shares of Agilysys by the redemption date. The conversion rate is 3.1746 common shares for each Trust Preferred Security, or the equivalent of $15.75 per common share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  June 30, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced that it has filed its fiscal 2005 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's Form 10-K reports fiscal 2005 sales of $1.6 billion, a 16% increase over fiscal 2004 and diluted earnings per share of $0.67 compared with $0.31 in fiscal 2004. The Form 10-K also reports two material weaknesses in the company's internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
Agilysys stated today that final year-end adjustments decreased fiscal 2005 net income by a total of $0.05 to $0.67 per diluted share, compared with the $0.72 per diluted share previously reported in the company's unaudited earnings release issued May 10, 2005. On June 13, 2005, the company reported that it expected to report an adjustment of $0.02 per diluted share. The $0.05 adjustment to earnings per share is primarily related to accruals for incentive and retirement plans.
The company also announced that in its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, management identified two material weaknesses, one of which was previously announced on June 13, 2005, relating to inadequate controls over the vendor debits process. Vendor debits are transactional discounts on purchases from major suppliers. The vendor debits process is manually intensive and involves thousands of individual transactions. The second material weakness identified was related to ineffective controls over the financial statement close process.
Agilysys is in the process of designing and implementing a comprehensive remediation plan to rectify the material weaknesses.
Martin Ellis, Agilysys executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, said, "We recognize that effective internal controls are the cornerstone to accurate and timely financial reporting and we are committed to refining the company's systems and processes to ensure the integrity of our financial reporting."
Portions of this release, particularly the statements made by management and those that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Agilysys. Many factors could cause Agilysys actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include those referenced in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or as may be described from time to time in Agilysys subsequent SEC filings.
Forward-Looking Language
Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to Agilysys anticipated revenue gains, sales volume, margin improvements, cost savings, new product introductions and remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
 
Other associated risks include geographic factors, political and economic risks, the actions of Agilysys competitors, changes in economic or industry conditions or in the markets served by Agilysys, the ability to appropriately integrate acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures, and the impact of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting on the ability of Agilysys to report its financial results timely and accurately.
In addition, this release contains time-sensitive information and reflects management's best analysis only as of the date of this release. Agilysys does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     The 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") was held on July 28, 2005. At the meeting shareholders approved the Company's Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). A summary of the Plan appears below. A more detailed description, as well as a copy of the Plan, can be found in the Company's definitive Schedule 14A filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on July 8, 2005.
Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan
     The purpose of the Plan is to promote the Company's compensation objectives by (i) providing short-term financial awards to executive officers of the Company in order to encourage them to improve the Company's operating results; and (ii) enabling the Company to recruit and retain such executive officers by making the Company's overall compensation program competitive with the compensation programs of similar companies. The Plan replaces the Company's 2000 Annual Incentive Plan, and is effective as of April 1, 2005. Incentive awards made under the Plan are intended to constitute qualified "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), and Section 1.162-27 of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is authorized to administer the Plan, provided that the Compensation Committee consists entirely of persons who meet the definition of "outside director" set forth in the regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. The employees eligible to receive compensation under the Plan are the Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated corporations.
     The Plan provides that, within the first 90 days of a fiscal year, and while the outcome is substantially uncertain, the Committee will establish the performance goal(s) which, if attained, will result in awards to the participants under the Plan (including relative weighting in the event that more than one performance goal is established), and will designate which eligible employees are selected for participation in the Plan. The performance goals may be based on any of the following business criteria (applied to a participant, a business unit, or the Company and related entities as a whole): stock price, revenue, operating income, operating profit, market share, sales, profitability, earnings per share, return on equity, return on capital, return on invested capital, costs or other similar objective criteria. The actual level of achievement of the performance goals will serve as the basis for establishing the amount of the award payable to a participant for the fiscal year. If the threshold level of attainment is not achieved, no payment will be made under the Plan for the fiscal year. Awards will be paid under the Plan following certification of the attainment of the established performance goal(s) for the fiscal year, and only to participants who were employed by the Company on the last day of such fiscal year and who were not terminated for cause prior to payment.
     For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, the Compensation Committee has selected the following performance measures: revenue, operating profit percentage and return on investment capital.
     Notwithstanding any other provision, no payments will be made for a fiscal year in which any minimum level of performance established under the relevant performance goal(s) is not attained, and no award to any participant for a fiscal year may exceed $5,000,000
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

[AGILYSYS LOGO] EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AGILYSYS, INC. REPORTS FISCAL 2006 FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS - Consolidated Sales Increase 6 Percent to $410 Million - Net Income of $0.01 per Diluted Share - Non-GAAP Net Income Reaches $0.15 per Diluted Share, Excluding Restructuring and Loss on Redemption of Convertible Trust Preferred Securities CLEVELAND - Aug. 4, 2005 - Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced fiscal 2006 unaudited first-quarter results for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Consolidated sales for the first quarter were $410.0 million, an increase of 6.0 percent compared with sales of $386.7 million for the first quarter last year. First-quarter sales of hardware products were $329.8 million, up 4.7 percent from $314.9 million last year. Software sales were $58.9 million, up 14.4 percent from $51.5 million a year ago, and services sales were $21.3 million, up 4.9 percent from $20.3 million last year. Gross margin for the first quarter was 12.4 percent of sales, compared with 12.6 percent in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $41.2 million, or 10.1 percent of sales, compared with $39.0 million, or 10.1 percent of sales, in the prior year. The company reported first-quarter net income of $290,000, or $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding a $2.4 million restructuring charge and a non-recurring $4.8 million loss on redemption of the company's Convertible Trust Preferred Securities, the company would have reported non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) net income of $4.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter last year. Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am pleased with our strong operating performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Our results reflect sales growth in each of our major product categories, continued execution of our strategic plan and a focus on improving operational efficiency." COMPANY REPORTS $2.4 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE During the quarter Agilysys initiated a plan to consolidate a portion of its operations to reduce costs and increase future operating efficiencies. As part of this restructuring effort, the company initiated the exit of certain leased facilities and headcount reduction. The company also executed a senior management consolidation of responsibilities. Restructuring charges increased $2.2 million during the quarter compared with last year, which reflects headcount reduction in the first quarter this year. The company has not recorded a liability for costs relating to the exit of certain leased facilities since the company had not ceased using such properties as of June 30, 2005. The company expects to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter ending September 30, 2005. Cost savings expected to be realized in fiscal 2006 as a result of the restructuring initiative are approximately $6 million. None of these cost savings were realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. REDEMPTION OF CONVERTIBLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES
As part of its strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value, on June 15, 2005 the company completed the redemption of its 6.75 percent Convertible Trust Preferred Securities ("Trust Preferred Securities"). As of March 31, 2005, the carrying value of the Trust Preferred Securities was $125.3 million. Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities were required to accept a cash payment or to convert into common shares of Agilysys by June 15, 2005. Trust Preferred Securities with a carrying value of $105.4 million were redeemed for cash at a total cost of $109.0 million, which included accrued interest of $1.5 million and a 2.025 percent premium of $2.1 million. Agilysys funded the redemption with existing cash balances. In addition, 398,324 Trust Preferred Securities with a carrying value of $19.9 million were converted into common shares of the company, resulting in the issuance of 1.3 million common shares. The company incurred a loss of $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result of the redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities. As part of the loss, the company wrote off deferred financing fees of $2.7 million. The financing fees, incurred at the time of issuing the Trust Preferred Securities, were being amortized over a 30-year period ending on March 31, 2028, which was the maturity date of the Trust Preferred Securities. The write off of deferred financing fees, together with the $2.1 million premium on redemption described above, resulted in the loss of $4.8 million. Agilysys shareholders will benefit by both the elimination of the annual distribution on the Trust Preferred Securities, which amounted to approximately $5.2 million annually, net of tax, and the elimination of 6.7 million shares of dilution. After the redemption and conversion to common shares, Agilysys will have approximately 30.4 million common shares issued and outstanding. ACQUISITION OF THE CTS CORPORATIONS During the first quarter of fiscal 2006 Agilysys completed its acquisition of The CTS Corporations for $27.5 million and began the process of integrating CTS into the company's professional services operation. The transaction, which closed on May 31, 2005, enhances the Agilysys offering of comprehensive storage solutions. The acquisition of CTS provides Agilysys a strong foundation to capitalize on current industry trends around storage products and services. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The non-GAAP operating results provided above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist them in assessing and understanding the company's operating performance and underlying trends in its business, as management considers the charges and losses referred to above to be outside the company's core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accompanying this release is a tabular reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measures with the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. UPDATED BUSINESS OUTLOOK Agilysys also provided its business outlook for fiscal 2006 including the results of its Convertible Trust Preferred Securities redemption. For fiscal 2006, the company currently estimates sales to grow approximately five to seven percent over fiscal 2005 sales of $1.62 billion. Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 12.4 percent of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 net income is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.88 per diluted share, including the impact of the restructuring charges discussed above and the loss on the Convertible Trust Preferred Securities redemption and the associated diluted share count impact.
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2006 capital expenditures between $2 and $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million, and interest expense will be offset by interest and other income, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.

AGILYSYS, INC. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of non-GAAP earnings per share - diluted: (a) Diluted earnings per share is determined as the lowest earnings per incremental share in the sequence of potential common shares. Approximately 6.6 million shares issuable upon conversion of the Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Trust Preferred Securities at June 30, 2005 were not included in determining GAAP earnings per share - diluted, because their effect was anti-dilutive. However, due to the increase in non-GAAP net income, the potential shares had a dilutive effect when determining non-GAAP earnings per share - diluted.

EXHIBIT 99.2 AGILYSYS, INC. Transcript from Fiscal 2006 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call August 4, 2005 OPERATOR: Good morning and welcome to the Agilysys' Fiscal 2006 First Quarter Conference Call. Before we begin, the Company would like to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please refer to the risk factors which can materially affect results outlined in Agilysys' corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Company's earnings release. During this conference call Agilysys' spokespersons may reference non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding such non-GAAP terms, as well as to comply with SEC requirements, Agilysys has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in today's news release, including disclosure on the reasons for the use of non-GAAP measures. You can find the news release on the Company's website in the investor relations section under news releases. This conference call is being recorded and also transcribed. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arthur Rhein, Chairman, President and CEO of Agilysys. Mr. Rhein. ARTHUR RHEIN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our un-audited results were issued before the market opened, and are currently available on our Web site. With me today is Martin Ellis, Executive Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officer, who will join me in the review of our first quarter results. Net income in the quarter was $0.01 per diluted share, but when adjusted for one time restructuring, and the loss on redemption of our convertible trust securities, pro forma EPS was $0.15 per diluted share. I am pleased with our strong performance. Our operating results reflect sales growth in each of our major product categories, continued execution of our strategic plan and a focus on improving operational efficiency. Sales were up 6% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. From a sales mix standpoint, hardware, which includes servers and storage, made up approximately 81% of total sales. Software made up 14% and services 5% on a net basis for remarketed services. Martin will provide you the details behind each of the product categories, but let's start by reviewing the overall business. In May, we reported a soft March quarter, with lower sales than expected. And our margin miss was directly related to lower IBM volume and lower than expected levels of earned incentives, predominantly in IBM Intel architecture products. We worked hard in the quarter to meet our sales objectives, and with that strong performance again achieved an appropriate level of supplier incentives. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of The CTS Corporations and the integration process is well underway. The addition of CTS enhances the Agilysys offering of comprehensive storage solutions. This includes proprietary solutions, as well as leading solutions from our current storage suppliers, including EMC, HP, Hitachi Data Systems and IBM. With its proven expertise in providing services essential to storage solution implementations, this acquisition will provide Agilysys a strong foundation to capitalize on current industry trends around storage products and services.
Software and services continue to grow as a larger part of our overall sales and profit mix. In fiscal 2005, these two categories made up approximately 19% of sales and 35% of our total gross profit dollars. In the last three years, proprietary services have grown to represent approximately 50% of our total services sales. And with the acquisition of CTS, it will be even greater. We believe our strategic plan to focus exclusively on providing enterprise computer technology solutions, acquiring differentiated software and services capabilities, and coupling these with hardware, will continue to drive performance. We are also taking steps to make the hardware component of our business more profitable. We are adjusting expenses and continue to make improvements to our operating model. In this quarter, we initiated a plan to reduce costs and drive future efficiencies. As part of this effort, we reduced our headcount and will exit a number of facilities and consolidate activities. Agilysys will complete most of this restructuring in our second quarter and expect to realize cost savings over the remainder of the year. Finally, as part of our strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value, on June 15th, the company completed the redemption of its 6.75% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. Agilysys shareholders benefit from both the elimination of the annual distribution on the preferred securities, which amounted to approximately $5.2 million net of tax, and the elimination of 6.7 million shares, or over 18% of dilution. Agilysys is now in a position where the company is essentially debt-free, with significant financial flexibility. This is in stark contrast to a little over three years ago, when in March of 2002, we had $23 million in cash, $179 million in Senior Notes and $144 million in Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. At this point, Martin will review the details of the quarter with you. MARTIN F. ELLIS, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you Art, and good morning everyone. I'd like to begin today by reminding you that the fiscal 2006 first quarter financial information is unaudited. For the quarter, we reported net income of 290,000 or $0.01 per diluted share. However, excluding a $2.4 million restructuring charge and a non-recurring $4.8 million loss on the redemption of the company's Convertible Preferred Securities, the company would have reported net income of 4.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared with net income of $4 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the first quarter last year. Sales for the quarter were $410 million, up 6% over first quarter fiscal 2005 sales of $386 million and up 15.3% sequentially. Sales of hardware products were $330 million in the current quarter, a 5% increase from $315 million in the first quarter a year ago. Sales of software were $58.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 14.4% over prior year. And services were $21.3 million in the current quarter, up 4.9% compared with $20.3 million last year. Recall that we report our remarketed services on a net basis and that is that we record gross margin on these services as both the sale and the gross margin. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for the quarter was 12.4%, compared with 12.6% during the same quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were 41.2 million or 10.1% of sales, compared with 39 million, or also 10.1% of sales in the prior year. The $2.2 million increase in SG&A expenses was mainly due to higher compensation and benefits, which increased approximately $2.1 million during the current quarter. Compensation and benefits attributed to the addition of CTS employees, together with costs associated with incentive and retirement plans, annual salary and wage increases, and variable compensation and commission plans that fluctuate with sales, account for most of this increase. During the quarter, we initiated a plan to consolidate a portion of our operations to reduce costs and increase future operating efficiencies. As part of that restructuring effort, the company initiated the exit of certain leased facilities and reduced its distribution channel work force. Restructuring charges, which predominantly reflect headcount reduction, increased $2.2 million during the quarter over prior year first quarter.
The company has not recorded a liability for costs relating to the exit of leased facilities which we have not ceased using as at June 30th, 2005. We expect to record an additional restructuring charge in the second quarter of approximately $2.3 million associated with facility closures and the synergies from the integration of CTS into the company's professional services business. The aggregate amount of costs to be incurred by the company upon completion of restructuring in fiscal 2006 is anticipated to be approximately $4.6 million to $4.9 million, most of which will be recorded in the first and second quarter. The cost savings to be realized in fiscal 2006 as a result of the restructuring are expected to be approximately $6 million, none of which were realized in the first quarter. The increase in interest income was the result of higher investment deals earned on the company's cash equivalents. As part of our strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value, on June 15th the company completed the redemption of its 6.75% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. As of March 31, the carrying value of the Trust Preferred Securities was $125.3 million. Holders of the Preferred Securities were required to accept a cash payment or to convert into common shares of Agilysys by June 15th. Preferred Securities worth a carrying value of 105.4 million were redeemed for cash at a total cost of $109 million which included accrued interest of $1.5 million, and a 2.025% premium of $2.1 million. The redemption was funded with existing cash balances. In addition, 398,000 Preferred Securities with a carrying value of 19.9 million were converted into common shares of the company, resulting in the issuance of 1.3 million common shares of the company. As a result of the redemption, the company incurred a loss of $4.8 million. The company wrote-off deferred financing fees of $2.7 million in the quarter. The financing and fees incurred at the time of issuing the securities were being amortized over a 30-year period ending March 31, 2028. The write-off of deferred financing fees, together with the $2.1 million premium on redemption resulted in the loss of $4.8 million. Shareholders will benefit from both the elimination of the annual dividend of the Preferred Securities which amounted to approximately $5.2 million annually, and that is net of tax, and the elimination of 6.7 million shares of dilution or approximately 18% of fully diluted shares. The conversion to common shares will result in approximately 30.4 million in Agilysys common shares being issued and outstanding. The provision for income taxes is $1.2 million or an effective tax rate of 46.9% compared with 36.6% for the same quarter in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects stated net operating loss carried forwards in the prior year which were not repeated in the current quarter, and the impact of tax legislation enacted by the State of Ohio during the quarter. Net income for the quarter was a penny per share. Also in our news release, you will note that we included a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings per share. Excluding the restructuring charge and loss on redemption of the Convertible Preferreds, non-GAAP net income was $0.15 per diluted share. One item I would like to draw your attention to is the diluted share counts. Approximately 6.6 million shares which would have been issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferreds were not included in determining GAAP earnings per share because their effect was anti-dilutive. However, due to the increase in non-GAAP net income, the 6.6 million shares had a dilutive effect when determining non-GAAP earnings per share. These shares only had an impact on the diluted share count for 10 weeks of the quarter that the Convertible Preferreds remained outstanding. Going forward, these shares will no longer be part of the share count except in one instance in fiscal 2006 which I will address when we discuss guidance. Now let me turn to the balance sheet at June 30 and treasury activities for the quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations was $30.6 million compared to $52.4 in the first quarter last year. While cash flow for the quarter was strong, the decrease year-over-year is the result of the smaller contribution from working capital improvements. We expect to continue to generate cash flow from operations for the fiscal year and our working capital as a percentage of sales remains below 5%. Cash and cash equivalents were $139.3 million at June 30 compared with $241.9 at March 31st. The $102.6 million reduction is a combination of the $30.6 million of cash flow from operations, $28.1 million used in investing activities primarily related to the acquisition of CTS and the $104.6 million used for financing activities which is the combination of the redemption of the Convertible Preferred Securities and an offset from the exercise of employee stock options during the quarter.
On May 31st, the company acquired The CTS Corporations. The purchase price was $27.5 million which included $2.6 million in assumed debt. Of the total purchase price, approximately 24 million has been assigned to goodwill which is the primary reason for the increase in goodwill from March 31. However, the company is still in the process of assessing the fair value of the acquired assets which includes identifying intangible assets. Allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets will take place in the near future and goodwill resulting from the CGS acquisition will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The $22.8 million increase in paid-in capital is primarily the result of the conversion of the preference shares with a carrying value of $19.9 million and $3.8 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Now let me turn to our revised guidance for fiscal 2006. Consistent with guidance provided during our last conference call, we currently expect sales to grow approximately 5%-7% over fiscal 2005 sales of $1.62 billion. Full year gross margin is expected to be 12.4% of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.5% of sales for fiscal 2006. Net income is still expected to be in the range $0.80 to $0.88 per diluted share after having accounted for the impact of the restructuring charges and the redemption of the Convertible Preferred Securities. We also expect to incur fiscal 2006 capital expenditures of between $2 million-$4 million. Depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million and interest expense will be offset by interest income and other income, assuming no additional retirement of our Senior Notes. Let me take a moment to discuss the impacts of the restructuring and the redemption of the Preferred Securities on share counts and earnings per share for the full year. Shares outstanding for the remainder of the year will be approximately 31.3 million. However when full fiscal year earnings per share is calculated, the share count will be approximately 32.6 million. This higher share count is a result of the weighted average share count during the year, when the 6.6 million shares I discussed earlier in the non-GAAP reconciliation are included in calculating EPS for the full year only. This diluted calculation will be applicable to the full year EPS calculation. Including the restructuring charges, the loss on redemption and the impact of this higher share count, our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at $0.80 to $0.88 per share. And with that we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? OPERATOR: And our first question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Thanks, could you hear me? A - ARTHUR RHEIN: Yes we can Brian. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Just wanted to revisit the earnings guidance again. I assume that the restructuring charges were not factored into your original guidance of $0.80 to $0.88, and I'm just trying to understand if that's the case, how much is that actually depressing earnings per share for the rest of the year? A - MARTIN ELLIS: Brian, it was not included in the original guidance. The restructuring for the year, as I mentioned, is anticipated to be between $4.6 and $4.9 million. Cost savings associated with the restructuring is expected to be approximately $6 million this year. So there should be a net benefit, a slight net benefit. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: So what I'm trying to understand is if your share count is lower for the year than you originally anticipated, because of the convert repurchase, and if you're going to get a net benefit from restructuring, and if your sales results just came in above our expectations, why wouldn't the earnings guidance, and perhaps the sales guidance be going up for the year, or are you just being conservative? A - MARTIN ELLIS: Well, there are a number of components to that question; the first is the share count has come down, but included in net income for the year will now be the restructuring charge, and the loss on redemption that was not included in previous guidance. So we've got the loss on redemption, which is now included in net income. And the share count is 32.6 million for full year EPS. When you combine the
loss on redemption, the $900,000 preference dividend that was paid in the first quarter, and that's after tax, and the net effect of the cost savings and the restructuring charge, EPS remains unchanged. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. I'll have to work through the math; I'm traveling. On the top line, did that come in above your expectations? A - ARTHUR RHEIN: It came in slightly above our expectations, but not enough to make really mention of. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. And maybe, I guess, two follow-ups. Just talk about the overall demand environment. I know you had a big snapback in the June quarter. What do you see so far in the September quarter? And then the follow-up would be on gross margins. I know you had some discussions with your major vendor IBM on perhaps seeing margins increase in the back half of the year, based on renegotiating some programs. Can you just update us on those discussions and whether you still feel that they should increase in the back half of the year? Thank you. A - ARTHUR RHEIN: We are still feeling pretty good Brian about our sales projections. I wouldn't say things are looking as though we are going to see any kind of hockey stick this year. We are looking at the 5 to 7% growth. We experienced 6 in the first quarter. So it's pretty consistent with what our expectations were. We were successful in terms of our sales - hitting our sales objectives this quarter, as well as addressing the issues that we talked about last quarter. And in fact we did receive appropriate incentives from our suppliers regarding our performance this quarter. Now, when we looked at that a quarter ago, candidly, we weren't sure that things would correct themselves as quickly as they have. And we also are being a bit conservative, if you will, in terms of our guidance, because we don't expect there to be a change, but certainly, as you well know, our quarterly gross margins can vary significantly as a function of the incentives as well as the sales performance. Now, historically we have seen margins improve in the second half of the year, as incentives contribute a bit more heavily in the second half of the year to our margins. That did not occur last year and that's why we are projecting at the current time that our margins remain essentially flat with where we were for the first quarter as we go through the balance of the year. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Can you just say exactly what changed, I guess, from last quarter to this quarter in terms of the gross margin performance? What product lines were you able to achieve higher margins on? A - ARTHUR RHEIN: Again, understanding, as I believe you well know Brian, that margins are a function of not only our selling margin, what we actually sell the product to the customer for versus our standard cost, but also the incentives that our suppliers place on selling certain products at certain volumes. And that can change in any given quarter. There is no question that as we addressed the issue in the March quarter, there was a specific problem that we had with Intel architecture. We believe that was corrected and in fact we received appropriate margins, appropriate incentives if you will on Intel architecture products this quarter along with the other products we sell, not only from IBM, but also HP and others. Q - BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay, thank you. A - ARTHUR RHEIN: Welcome. OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Chris Wallace from Thomas Weisel Partners. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Yeah, hi thank you. I was wondering what the full year distribution for the convertible will be; I think this quarter you said it was $900,000. What should we expect for the full 2006? A - MARTIN ELLIS: Chris, the full year distribution is $900,000. There will be no further distributions. That $900,000 reflects the distribution through the redemption dated at June 15. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Okay, great, and then so for the diluted share count. We are looking at 32.6 for the full year?
A - MARTIN ELLIS: 32.6 for the full year, 31.3 for each of the quarters, so it's an unusual year. The revised share count post the redemption is 31.3, but for full year EPS calculations, we need to perform a weighted average calculation, which includes the convertible preferred that were outstanding for the first ten weeks of the year. So for your full year EPS, you need to use 32.6 million shares. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Okay, great and so-- A - MARTIN ELLIS: 31.3 on a quarterly basis. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Right, and to get to the $0.15 that you have this year in pro forma EPS, you're using 36.4 million shares, and what would be the net income that you're using to actually get to that number? A - MARTIN ELLIS: We would be using the $5.5 million net income, which is on the supplementary reconciliation page in our release this morning. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Right, okay, and you get to that after adding back the distribution. Okay, great. Got it, thank you. A - MARTIN ELLIS: After adding back the distribution, that's correct. Q - CHRIS WALLACE: Right, thank you. OPERATOR: Mr. Rhein, at this time I'm showing no further questions. ARTHUR RHEIN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well that's fine. We thank you all for participating on today's call and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in the future. Good afternoon.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information provided in Item 2.03 is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As of October 18, 2005, in connection with entry into the new credit facility described in Item 2.03 hereof, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") terminated its three-year $100 million unsecured credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility"), dated April 16, 2003, as amended, by and among the Company, as borrower, U.S. Bank National Association, as syndication agent, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as document agent, KeyBank National Association, as book runner and administrative agent, and certain other lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Facility was available to refinance existing debt, provide for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes of the Company including acquisitions. The lenders under the Prior Credit Facility and their affiliates have engaged and may engage in commercial and investment banking transactions with the Company in the ordinary course of business, and also provide or have provided advisory and financial services to the Company.
On October 18, 2005, the Company entered into a $200 million five-year unsecured credit facility (the "New Credit Facility") with LaSalle Bank National Association, as lead arranger, book runner and administrative agent, and certain other lenders party thereto. The New Credit Facility includes a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit issued by LaSalle Bank National Association or one of its affiliates and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements.
The New Credit Facility is available to refinance existing debt, provide for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes of the Company including acquisitions. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility will bear interest at one of two rates as described in the New Credit Facility.
The New Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, a leverage ratio of less than 3.00 to 1.00, a fixed charge coverage ratio of no more than 1.2 to 1.00 and certain consolidated net worth requirements. For any fiscal quarter in which the leverage ratio exceeds 2.00 to 1.00, a liquidity ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for such quarter would be applicable as well. The New Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties.
Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under the New Credit Facility, including principal and interest amounts, and terminate the agreement. Events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the New Credit Facility, covenant defaults, materially false or erroneous representations and warranties, cross defaults relating to other material indebtedness of the Company, certain ERISA defaults, change of control and other customary defaults.
The lenders under the New Credit Facility and their affiliates have engaged and may engage in commercial and investment banking transactions with the Company in the ordinary course of business, and also provide or have provided advisory and financial services to the Company.
The description of the New Credit Facility set forth in this Item 2.03 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the New Credit Facility filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.

Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or renewed at the rate of one-eighth percent (1/8%) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit; and (C) pay to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Fronting Lender, such other issuance, amendment, negotiation, draw, acceptance, telex, courier, postage and similar transactional fees as are generally charged by the Fronting Lender under its fee schedule as in effect from time to time. (iv) Refunding of Letters of Credit with Revolving Loans. Whenever a Letter of Credit shall be drawn, US Borrowers, and any Foreign Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued, shall immediately reimburse the Fronting Lender for the amount drawn. In the event that the amount drawn is not in an Alternate Currency and shall not have been reimbursed by such Borrowers, as applicable, within one Business Day of the drawing of such Letter of Credit, at the sole option of Agent (and the Fronting Lender, if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent), Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.2(a) and 2.5 hereof (other than the requirement set forth in Section 2.5(d) hereof), in the amount drawn. Such Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the Revolving Credit Notes (or, if a Lender has not requested a Revolving Credit Note, by the records of Agent and such Lender). Each Lender agrees to make a Revolving Loan on the date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof when required by this Section 2.2(b)(iv) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lender, of the proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Borrowers irrevocably authorize and instruct Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)(iv) to reimburse, in full (other than the Fronting Lender's pro rata share of such borrowing), the Fronting Lender for the amount drawn on such Letter of Credit. Each such Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records relating to its Revolving Credit Note (or, if such Lender has not requested a Revolving Credit Note, its records relating to Revolving Loans) such Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit. (v) Participation in Letters of Credit. If, for any reason, Agent (and the Fronting Lender if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent) shall be unable to or, in the opinion of Agent, it shall be impracticable to, convert any Letter of Credit to a Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding subsection, or if the amount not reimbursed is a Letter of Credit drawn in an Alternate Currency, Agent (and the Fronting Lender if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent) shall have the right to request that each Lender purchase a participation in the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit, and Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof (by facsimile or telephone, confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, the Fronting Lender hereby agrees to grant to each Lender, and each Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the 26
Fronting Lender, an undivided participation interest in the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the principal amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lender, such Lender's ratable share of the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit (determined in accordance with such Lender's Commitment Percentage). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in the amount due under any Letter of Credit that is drawn but not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)(v) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this Section 2.2(b)(v) by wire transfer of immediately available funds (in Dollars, except in the case of a Letter of Credit issued and drawn in an Alternate Currency, and, in such case, in such Alternate Currency), in the same manner as provided in Section 2.5 hereof with respect to Revolving Loans. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records such Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit. (c) Swing Loans. (i) Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the Swing Line Lender shall make a Swing Loan or Swing Loans to US Borrowers in such amount or amounts as Administrative Borrower, through an Authorized Officer, may from time to time request; provided that Administrative Borrower shall not request any Swing Loan if, after giving effect thereto, (A) the Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Total Commitment Amount, or (B) the Swing Line Exposure would exceed the Swing Line Commitment. Each Swing Loan shall be due and payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. US Borrowers shall not request that more than two Swing Loans be outstanding at any time. Each Swing Loan shall be made in Dollars. (ii) Refunding of Swing Loans. If the Swing Line Lender so elects, by giving notice to Administrative Borrower and the Lenders, US Borrowers agree that the Swing Line Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that any Swing Loan be refinanced as a Revolving Loan. Such Revolving Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to US Borrowers hereunder. Upon receipt of such notice by US Borrowers and the Lenders, US Borrowers shall be deemed, on such day, to have requested a Revolving Loan in the principal amount of the Swing Loan in accordance with Sections 2.2(a) and 2.5 hereof (other than the requirement set forth in Section 2.5(d) hereof). Such Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the US Borrower Revolving Credit Notes (or, if a Lender has not requested a US Borrower Revolving Credit Note, by the records of Agent and such Lender). Each Lender agrees to make a 27
Revolving Loan on the date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that such Lender's obligation to make a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof when required by this Section 2.2(c)(ii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for the account of the Swing Line Lender, of the proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. US Borrowers irrevocably authorize and instruct Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(ii) to repay in full such Swing Loan. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records relating to its US Borrower Revolving Credit Note (or, if such Lender has not requested a US Borrower Revolving Credit Note, its records relating to Revolving Loans) such Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid to refund such Swing Loan. (iii) Participation in Swing Loans. If, for any reason, Agent is unable to or, in the opinion of Agent, it is impracticable to, convert any Swing Loan to a Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding Section 2.2(c)(ii), then on any day that a Swing Loan is outstanding (whether before or after the maturity thereof), Agent shall have the right to request that each Lender purchase a participation in such Swing Loan, and Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof (by facsimile or telephone, confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, the Swing Line Lender hereby agrees to grant to each Lender, and each Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the Swing Line Lender, an undivided participation interest in such Swing Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the principal amount of such Swing Loan. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender, such Lender's ratable share of such Swing Loan (determined in accordance with such Lender's Commitment Percentage). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(iii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this Section 2.2(c)(iii) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.5 hereof with respect to Revolving Loans to be made by such Lender. Section 2.3. Interest. (a) Revolving Loans. 28
(i) Base Rate Loan. The appropriate Borrower or Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of a Base Rate Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the Derived Base Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on such Base Rate Loan shall be payable, commencing December 31, 2005, and on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter and at the maturity thereof. (ii) LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans. The appropriate Borrower or Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan outstanding from time to time, fixed in advance on the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto through the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (but subject to changes in the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans), at the Derived LIBOR Fixed Rate. Interest on such LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan shall be payable on each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an Interest Period (provided that if an Interest Period shall exceed three months, the interest must be paid every three months, commencing three months from the beginning of such Interest Period). (b) Swing Loans. US Borrowers shall pay interest to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Swing Line Lender (and any Lender that shall have purchased a participation in such Swing Loan), on the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the Base Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on each Swing Loan shall be payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. Each Swing Loan shall bear interest for a minimum of one day. (c) Default Rate. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if an Event of Default shall occur, upon the election of the Required Lenders (i) the principal of each Loan and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest, until paid, at the Default Rate, (ii) the fee for the aggregate undrawn amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of Credit shall be increased by two percent (2%) in excess of the rate otherwise applicable thereto, and (iii) in the case of any other amount not paid when due from Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document, such amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate; provided that, during an Event of Default under Section 7.1 or 7.11 hereof, the applicable Default Rate shall apply without any election or action on the part of Agent or any Lender. (d) Limitation on Interest. In no event shall the rate of interest hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowable by law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). If Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations. 29
Section 2.4. Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) US Borrower Revolving Loans. Upon the request of a Lender, to evidence the obligation of US Borrowers to repay the Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender and to pay interest thereon, US Borrowers shall execute a US Borrower Revolving Credit Note in the form of the attached Exhibit A, payable to the order of such Lender in the principal amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Revolving Loans made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure of a Lender to request a US Borrower Revolving Credit Note shall in no way detract from US Borrowers' obligations to such Lender hereunder. (b) Foreign Borrower Revolving Loans. Upon the request of a Lender, to evidence the obligation of each Foreign Borrower to repay the Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender and to pay interest thereon, each such Foreign Borrower shall execute a Foreign Borrower Revolving Credit Note in the form of the attached Exhibit B, payable to the order of such Lender in the principal amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Revolving Loans made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure of a Lender to request a Foreign Borrower Revolving Credit Note shall in no way detract from such Foreign Borrower's obligations to such Lender hereunder. (c) Swing Loan. Upon the request of the Swing Line Lender, to evidence the obligation of US Borrowers to repay the Swing Loans and to pay interest thereon, US Borrowers shall execute a Swing Line Note in the form of the attached Exhibit C, and payable to the order of the Swing Line Lender in the principal amount of the Swing Line Commitment, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Swing Loans made by the Swing Line Lender; provided, however, that the failure of the Swing Line Lender to request a Swing Line Note shall in no way detract from US Borrowers' obligations to the Swing Line Lender hereunder. Section 2.5. Notice of Credit Event; Funding of Loans. (a) Notice of Credit Event. Administrative Borrower, through an Authorized Officer, shall provide to Agent a Notice of Loan prior to (i) 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the proposed date of borrowing or conversion of any Base Rate Loan, (ii) 12:00 noon (Eastern time) three Business Days prior to the proposed date of borrowing, conversion or continuation of any Eurodollar Loan, (iii) 12:00 noon (Eastern time) three Business Days prior to the proposed date of borrowing of any Alternate Currency Loan, and (iv) 3:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the proposed date of borrowing of any Swing Loan. Administrative Borrower shall comply with the notice provisions set forth in Section 2.2(b)(ii) hereof with respect to Letters of Credit. (b) Funding of Loans. Agent shall notify each Lender of the date, amount, type of currency and Interest Period (if applicable) promptly upon the receipt of a Notice of Loan, and, in any event, by 2:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date such Notice of Loan is received. On the date that the Credit Event set forth in such Notice of Loan is to occur, each such Lender shall provide to Agent, not later than 3:00 P.M. (Eastern time), the amount in Dollars, or, with respect to an Alternate Currency, in the applicable Alternate Currency, in federal or other immediately 30
available funds, required of it. If Agent shall elect to advance the proceeds of such Loan prior to receiving funds from such Lender, Agent shall have the right, upon prior notice to Administrative Borrower, to debit any account of any US Borrower or otherwise receive such amount from US Borrowers or the appropriate Foreign Borrower, on demand, in the event that such Lender shall fail to reimburse Agent in accordance with this subsection. Agent shall also have the right to receive interest from such Lender at the Federal Funds Effective Rate in the event that such Lender shall fail to provide its portion of the Loan on the date requested and Agent shall elect to provide such funds. (c) Conversion of Loans. At the request of Administrative Borrower to Agent, subject to the notice and other provisions of this Section 2.5, the Lenders shall convert a Base Rate Loan to one or more Eurodollar Loans at any time and shall convert a Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan on any Interest Adjustment Date applicable thereto. Swing Loans may be converted by the Swing Line Lender to Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(ii) hereof. No Alternate Currency Loan may be converted to a Base Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan and no Base Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan may be converted to an Alternate Currency Loan. (d) Minimum Amount. Each request for: (i) a Base Rate Loan shall be in an amount of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); (ii) a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan shall be in an amount (or, with respect to an Alternate Currency Loan, such approximately comparable amount as shall result in a rounded number) of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (or, with respect to an Alternate Currency Loan, such approximately comparable amount as shall result in a rounded number); and (iii) a Swing Loan shall be in an amount of not less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000). (e) Interest Periods. Borrowers shall not request that LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans be outstanding for more than eight different Interest Periods at the same time. Section 2.6. Payment on Loans and Other Obligations. (a) Payments Generally. Each payment made hereunder by a Credit Party shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (b) Payments in Alternate Currency. With respect to any Alternate Currency Loan or any Alternate Currency Letter of Credit, all payments (including prepayments) to any Lender of the principal of or interest on such Alternate Currency Loan or Alternate Currency Letter of Credit shall be made in the same Alternate Currency as the original Loan or Letter of Credit. All such payments shall be remitted by Borrowers to Agent, at the address of Agent for notices 31
referred to in Section 10.4 hereof, (or at such other office or account as designated in writing by Agent to Administrative Borrower) for the account of the Lenders (or the Fronting Lender or the Swing Line Lender, as appropriate) not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the due date thereof in same day funds. Any payments received by Agent after 12:00 noon (Eastern time) shall be deemed to have been made and received on the next Business Day. (c) Payments in Dollars. With respect to (i) any Loan (other than an Alternate Currency Loan), or (ii) any other payment to Agent and the Lenders that shall not be covered by subsection (b) above, all such payments (including prepayments) to Agent of the principal of or interest on such Loan or other payment, including but not limited to principal, interest, fees or any other amount owed by any Borrower under this Agreement, shall be made in Dollars. All payments described in this Section 2.6(c) shall be remitted to Agent, at the address of Agent for notices referred to in Section 10.4 hereof for the account of the Lenders (or the Fronting Lender or the Swing Line Lender, as appropriate) not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the due date thereof in immediately available funds. Any such payments received by Agent after 11:00 A.M. (Eastern time) shall be deemed to have been made and received on the next Business Day. (d) Payments to Lenders. Upon Agent's receipt of payments hereunder, Agent shall immediately distribute to each Lender (except with respect to Swing Loans, which shall be paid to the Swing Line Lender or, with respect to Letters of Credit, certain of which payments shall be paid to the Fronting Lender) its ratable shares, if any, of the amount of principal, interest, and facility and other fees received by Agent for the account of such Lender. Payments received by Agent in Dollars shall be delivered to the Lenders in Dollars in immediately available funds. Payments received by Agent in any Alternate Currency shall be delivered to the Lenders in such Alternate Currency in same day funds. Each Lender shall record any principal, interest or other payment, the principal amounts of Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans, Swing Loans and Letters of Credit, the type of currency for each Loan, all prepayments and the applicable dates, including Interest Periods, with respect to the Loans made, and payments received by such Lender, by such method as such Lender may generally employ; provided, however, that failure to make any such entry shall in no way detract from the obligations of Borrowers under this Agreement or any Note. The aggregate unpaid amount of Loans, types of Loans, Interest Periods and similar information with respect to the Loans and Letters of Credit set forth on the records of Agent shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence with respect to such information, including the amounts of principal, interest and fees owing to each Lender. (e) Timing of Payments. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder, including, without limitation, any payment to be made on any Loan, shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next Business Day and such extension of time shall in each case be included in the computation of the interest payable on such Loan; provided, however, that, with respect to a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan, if the next Business Day shall fall in the succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day and the relevant Interest Period shall be adjusted accordingly. 32
Section 2.7. Prepayment. (a) Right to Prepay. Borrowers shall have the right at any time or from time to time to prepay, on a pro rata basis for all of the Lenders, all or any part of the principal amount of the Revolving Loans then outstanding, as designated by Administrative Borrower, plus interest accrued on the amount so prepaid to the date of such prepayment, and any amount payable under Article III hereof with respect to the amount being prepaid. US Borrowers shall have the right, at any time or from time to time, to prepay, for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender (and any Lender that has purchased a participation in such Swing Loan), all or any part of the principal amount of the Swing Loans then outstanding, as designated by Administrative Borrower, plus interest accrued on the amount so prepaid to the date of such prepayment, and any amount payable under Article III hereof with respect to the amount being prepaid. (b) Notice of Prepayment. Administrative Borrower shall give Agent notice of prepayment of a Base Rate Loan or Swing Loan by no later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the Business Day on which such prepayment is to be made and written notice of the prepayment of any LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan not later than 2:00 P.M. (Eastern time) three Business Days before the Business Day on which such prepayment is to be made. (c) Minimum Amount. Each prepayment of a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan shall be in the principal amount of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (or, with respect to an Alternate Currency Loan, rounded to a comparable amount of such amount) or, with respect to a Swing Loan, the principal balance of such Swing Loan, except in the case of a mandatory payment pursuant to Section 2.10 or Article III hereof. Section 2.8. Facility and Other Fees; Reduction of Commitment. (a) Facility Fee. US Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the ratable account of the Lenders, as a consideration for the Commitment, a facility fee from the Closing Date to and including the last day of the Commitment Period, payable quarterly, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Applicable Facility Fee Rate in effect on the payment date, multiplied by (ii) the average daily Total Commitment Amount in effect during such quarter. The facility fee shall be payable in arrears, on December 31, 2005 and continuing on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter, and on the last day of the Commitment Period. (b) Agent Fee. US Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for its sole benefit, the fees set forth in the Agent Fee Letter. (c) Optional Reduction of Commitment. Borrowers may at any time and from time to time permanently reduce in whole or ratably in part the Total Commitment Amount to an amount not less than the then existing Revolving Credit Exposure, by Administrative Borrower giving Agent not fewer than three Business Days' written notice of such reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount, for all of the Lenders, of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the date of each such reduction and such Lender's proportionate share thereof. After each such reduction, the facility fees payable hereunder shall 33
be calculated upon the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced. If Borrowers reduce in whole the Commitment, on the effective date of such reduction (the appropriate Borrowers having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance, if any, of the Loans, together with all interest and facility and other fees accrued and unpaid, and provided that no Letter of Credit Exposure or Swing Line Exposure shall exist), all of the Notes, if any, shall be delivered to Agent marked "Canceled" and Agent shall redeliver such Notes to Administrative Borrower. Any partial reduction in the Total Commitment Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period. Section 2.9. Computation of Interest and Fees. With the exception of Base Rate Loans and, if applicable, Alternate Currency Loans, interest on Loans, and facility and other fees and charges hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty (360) days and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. With respect to Base Rate Loans, interest shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. With respect to certain Alternate Currency Loans (to the extent it is the market standard for the applicable Alternate Currency), interest shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. Section 2.10. Mandatory Payments. (a) If, at any time, the Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Total Commitment Amount as then in effect, US Borrowers (and the appropriate Foreign Borrowers) shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, pay an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans sufficient to bring the Revolving Credit Exposure within the Total Commitment Amount. (b) If, at any time, the Swing Line Exposure shall exceed the Swing Line Commitment, US Borrowers shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Swing Loans sufficient to bring the Swing Line Exposure within the Swing Line Commitment. (c) Unless otherwise designated by Borrowers, each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be applied in the following order (i) first, on a pro rata basis for the Lenders, to outstanding Base Rate Loans, and (ii) second, on a pro rata basis for the Lenders, to outstanding Eurodollar Loans (to Eurodollars Loans with the earliest Interest Adjustment Dates first), provided that if the outstanding principal amount of any Eurodollar Loan shall be reduced to an amount less than the minimum amount set forth in Section 2.5(d) hereof as a result of such prepayment, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the date of such prepayment. Any prepayment of a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan or Swing Loan pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be subject to the prepayment penalties set forth in Article III hereof. Section 2.11. Effectiveness of Guaranties. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Agilysys shall cause each Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) to execute and deliver to Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a Guaranty of Payment, to 34
provide Organizational Documents and a legal opinion with respect to such Guaranty of Payment, and to provide such other documents as Agent shall deem reasonably necessary or appropriate (the "Guaranty Documents"). Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, acknowledges that the Guaranty Documents will be held in escrow by Agent and that any guaranty granted by such Domestic Subsidiary to Agent in the Guaranty Documents shall not be effective until the earliest of (a) Agilysys shall fail to comply with any financial covenant set forth in Section 5.7 hereof and the Required Lenders shall not have waived such violation in writing or amended such financial covenant to cure such violation within thirty (30) days after such failure to comply, (b) an Event of Default shall occur under Section 7.1, 7.7, or 7.11 hereof, or (c) the Guaranty Effectiveness Date, at which time Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, release the Guaranty Documents from escrow to Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders. Borrowers acknowledge and agree that Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may release the Guaranty Documents from escrow under any of the preceding conditions by providing five days prior notice to Administrative Borrower or such Domestic Subsidiary (provided that no notice or time period shall be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred under Section 7.11 hereof), and such Guaranty Documents shall thereafter be automatically effective, without any further action by Agent, any Lender or any Credit Party or other Company. The provisions in this Section 2.11 shall control over the provisions of the Guaranty Documents until such time as the Guaranty Documents shall become effective in accordance with this Section 2.11. Section 2.12. Liability of Borrowers. (a) Joint and Several Liability. Each US Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Agent and the Lenders are entering into this Agreement at the request of each US Borrower and with the understanding that each US Borrower is and shall remain fully liable, jointly and severally, for payment in full of the Obligations. Each US Borrower agrees that it is receiving or will receive a direct pecuniary benefit for each Loan made or Letter of Credit issued hereunder. (b) Appointment of Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Agilysys as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers ("Administrative Borrower") which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Borrower to (i) provide Agent with all notices with respect to Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement, (ii) take such action as Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Loans and Letters of Credit, and (iii) exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. (c) Maximum Liability of Each Subsidiary Borrower. Anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the maximum liability of any Subsidiary Borrower exceed the maximum amount that (after giving effect to the incurring of the obligations hereunder and to any rights to contribution of such Subsidiary Borrower from other Affiliates of such Subsidiary Borrower) would not render the rights to 35
payment of Agent and the Lenders hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law. (d) Waivers of Each Borrower. In the event that any obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement is deemed to be an agreement by such Borrower to answer for the debt or default of another Credit Party or as a hypothecation of property as security therefore, each Borrower represents and warrants that (i) no representation has been made to such Borrower as to the creditworthiness of such other Credit Party, and (ii) such Borrower has established adequate means of obtaining from such other Credit Party on a continuing basis, financial or other information pertaining to such other Credit Party's financial condition. Each Borrower expressly waives, except as expressly required under this Agreement, diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice of every kind and nature whatsoever, consents to the taking by Agent and the Lenders of any additional security, if any, of another Credit Party for the obligations secured hereby, or the alteration or release in any manner of any security, if any, of another Credit Party now or hereafter held in connection with the Obligations, and consents that Agent, the Lenders and any other Credit Party may deal with each other in connection with such obligations or otherwise, or alter any contracts now or hereafter existing between them, in any manner whatsoever, including without limitation the renewal, extension, acceleration or changes in time for payment of any such obligations or in the terms or conditions of any security held. Agent and the Lenders are hereby expressly given the right, at their option, to proceed in the enforcement of any of the Obligations independently of any other remedy or security they may at any time hold in connection with such obligations secured and it shall not be necessary for Agent and the Lenders to proceed upon or against or exhaust any other security or remedy before proceeding to enforce their rights against such Borrower. Each Borrower further subordinates any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, setoff or other recourse in respect of sums paid to Agent and the Lenders by any other Credit Party.

(e) Alternative Structures. Agent, the Lenders and Borrowers agree that, if the addition of a Foreign Borrower or Foreign Guarantor of Payment pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) above would result in a requirement by such Foreign Borrower or Foreign Guarantor of Payment to pay to any Lenders additional amounts pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, then Agent, the Lenders and Borrowers agree to use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office or otherwise propose an alternate structure that would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such additional amounts so long as the same would not, in the judgment of Agent and the Lenders, be otherwise disadvantageous to Agent and the Lenders. ARTICLE III. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO LIBOR FIXED RATE LOANS; INCREASED CAPITAL; TAXES Section 3.1. Requirements of Law. (a) If, after the Closing Date (i) the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or (ii) the compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority: (A) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Taxes and Excluded Taxes which are governed by Section 3.2 hereof); (B) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate or the Alternate Currency Rate; or (C) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; 38
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, US Borrowers (and any Foreign Borrower to which such Loan was made) shall pay to such Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable, provided that such additional amount does not constitute a penalty. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection (a), such Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that, after the Closing Date, the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder, or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit, to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or corporation with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon submission by such Lender to Administrative Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of a written request therefor (which shall include the method for calculating such amount and reasonable detail regarding such calculation), US Borrowers (and any Foreign Borrower to which such Loan was made) shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction, provided that such additional amount does not constitute a penalty. (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 submitted by any Lender to Administrative Borrower, together with a reasonably detailed calculation and description of such amounts contemplated by this Section 3.1 (with a copy to Agent) shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amounts so payable. In determining any such additional amounts, such Lender may use any method of averaging and attribution that it (in its good faith, reasonable credit judgment) shall deem applicable. The obligations of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 3.2. Taxes. (a) All payments made by any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes or Other Taxes. If any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to Agent or any Lender thereunder, the amounts so payable to Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Agent or such Lender (after deducting, withholding and payment of all Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in the Loan Documents. 39
(b) In addition, the Credit Parties shall pay Taxes and Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld and paid by a Credit Party, such Credit Party shall timely withhold and pay such taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities. As promptly as possible thereafter, such Credit Party shall send to Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Credit Party showing payment thereof or other evidence of payment reasonably acceptable to Agent or such Lender. If such Credit Party shall fail to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority fails to remit to Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, US Borrowers and such Credit Party shall indemnify Agent and the appropriate Lenders on demand for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Agent or such Lender as a result of any such failure. (d) If any Lender shall be so indemnified by a Credit Party, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party and shall reimburse such Credit Party to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Lender shall receive a refund with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of such Lender) of the United States or any state or subdivision or any other Governmental Authority thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to such Lender. If, at the time any audit of such Lender's income tax return is completed, such Lender determines, based on such audit, that it shall not have been entitled to the full amount of any refund reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid or that its net income taxes shall not have been reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid, such Credit Party, upon request of such Lender, shall promptly pay to such Lender the amount so refunded to which such Lender shall not have been so entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of such Lender shall not have been so reduced, as the case may be. (e) Each Lender that is not (i) a citizen or resident of the United States of America, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any jurisdiction thereof), or (iii) an estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (any such Person, a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement with respect to such interest and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by Credit Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement or such other Loan Document. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms or appropriate replacements 40
promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Borrower at any time it determines that such Lender is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Administrative Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (e), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this subsection (e) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (f) The agreements in this Section 3.2 shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 3.3. Funding Losses. US Borrowers (and the appropriate Foreign Borrower) agree to indemnify each Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any properly documented loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by a Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by a Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) the making of a prepayment of a Swing Loan on a day that is not the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto, or (e) any conversion of a Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto. Such indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest (with no premium or penalty thereon) that would have accrued on the amounts so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) or the applicable Swing Loan Maturity Date in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender (with no premium or penalty thereon)) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the appropriate London interbank market, along with any administration fee charged by such Lender. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 submitted to Administrative Borrower, together with a reasonably detailed calculation and description of such amounts (with a copy to Agent) by any Lender shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amount so payable. The obligations of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 3.4. Eurodollar Rate or Alternate Currency Rate Lending Unlawful; Inability to Determine Rate. (a) If any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof to Administrative Borrower and Agent, be conclusive and binding on Borrowers) that, after the 41
Closing Date, (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or (ii) any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to make or continue any Loan as, or to convert (if permitted pursuant to this Agreement) any Loan into, a LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue or convert any such LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan shall, upon such determination, be suspended until such Lender shall notify Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all outstanding LIBOR Fixed Rate Loans payable to such Lender shall automatically convert (if conversion is permitted under this Agreement) into a Base Rate Loan, or be repaid (if no conversion is permitted) at the end of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by law or such assertion. (b) If Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate or Alternate Currency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate or Alternate Currency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, Agent will promptly so notify Administrative Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain such LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan shall be suspended until Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Administrative Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of such LIBOR Fixed Rate Loan or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein. Section 3.5. Discretion of Lenders as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of such Lender's Loans in any manner such Lender deems to be appropriate; it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan or Alternate Currency Loan during the applicable Interest Period for such Loan through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate or Alternate Currency Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period. ARTICLE IV. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT Section 4.1. Conditions to Each Credit Event.

If any Event of Default referred to in Section 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9 or 7.10 hereof shall occur, Agent may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, and shall, at the written request of the Required Lenders, give written notice to Administrative Borrower to: (a) terminate the Commitment, if not previously terminated, and, immediately upon such election, the obligations of the Lenders, and each thereof, to make any further Loan and the obligation of the Fronting Lender to issue any Letter of Credit immediately shall be terminated; and/or (b) accelerate the maturity of all of the Obligations (if the Obligations are not already due and payable), whereupon all of the Obligations shall become and thereafter be immediately due and payable in full without any presentment or demand and without any further or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower. Section 8.2. Automatic Defaults. If any Event of Default referred to in Section 7.11 hereof shall occur: (a) all of the Commitment shall automatically and immediately terminate, if not previously terminated, and no Lender thereafter shall be under any obligation to grant any further Loan, nor shall the Fronting Lender be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit; and (b) the principal of and interest then outstanding on all of the Loans, and all of the other Obligations, shall thereupon become and thereafter be immediately due and payable in full (if the Obligations are not already due and payable), all without any presentment, demand or notice of any kind, which are hereby waived by each Borrower. Section 8.3. Letters of Credit. If the maturity of the Obligations shall be accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, US Borrowers shall immediately deposit with Agent, as security for the obligations of US Borrowers and any Guarantor of Payment to reimburse Agent and the Lenders for any then outstanding Letters of Credit, cash equal to the sum of the aggregate undrawn balance of any then outstanding Letters of Credit. Agent and the Lenders are hereby authorized, at their option, to deduct any and all such amounts from any deposit balances then owing by any Lender (or any affiliate of such Lender, wherever located) to or for the credit or account of any US Borrower or Domestic Guarantor of Payment, as security for the obligations of US Borrowers and any Guarantor of Payment to reimburse Agent and the Lenders for any then outstanding Letters of Credit. Section 8.4. Offsets. If there shall occur or exist any Event of Default referred to in Section 7.11 hereof or if the maturity of the Obligations is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, each Lender shall have the right at any time to set off against, and to appropriate and apply toward the payment of, any and all of the Obligations then owing by a Borrower or Guarantor of Payment to such Lender (including, without limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to Section 2.2(b), 2.2(c) or 8.5 hereof), whether or not the same shall then have matured, any and all deposit (general or special) balances and all other indebtedness then held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies or 63
any affiliate of such Lender, wherever located) to or for the credit or account of such Borrower or Guarantor of Payment, all without notice to or demand upon such Borrower or any other Person, all such notices and demands being hereby expressly waived by each Borrower. Section 8.5. Equalization Provision. Each Lender agrees with the other Lenders that if it, at any time, shall obtain any Advantage over the other Lenders or any thereof in respect of the Obligations (except as to Swing Loans and Letters of Credit prior to Agent's giving of notice to participate and except under Article III hereof), it shall purchase from the other Lenders, for cash and at par, such additional participation in the Obligations as shall be necessary to nullify the Advantage. If any such Advantage resulting in the purchase of an additional participation as aforesaid shall be recovered in whole or in part from the Lender receiving the Advantage, each such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price restored (but without interest unless the Lender receiving the Advantage is required to pay interest on the Advantage to the Person recovering the Advantage from such Lender) ratably to the extent of the recovery. Each Lender further agrees with the other Lenders that if it at any time shall receive any payment for or on behalf of any Borrower on any indebtedness owing by any Borrower to that Lender pursuant to this Agreement (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by reason of offset of any deposit or other indebtedness, by counterclaim or cross-action, by the enforcement of any right under any Loan Document, or otherwise), it will apply such payment first to any and all Obligations owing by such Borrower to that Lender (including, without limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to this Section 8.5 or any other Section of this Agreement). Each Credit Party agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from the other Lenders or any thereof pursuant to this Section 8.5 may exercise all of its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation. Section 8.6. Other Remedies. The remedies in this Article VIII are in addition to, not in limitation of, any other right, power, privilege, or remedy, either in law, in equity, or otherwise, to which the Lenders may be entitled. Agent shall exercise the rights under this Article VIII and all other collection efforts on behalf of the Lenders and no Lender shall act independently with respect thereto, except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement. ARTICLE IX. THE AGENT The Lenders authorize LaSalle Bank National Association and LaSalle Bank National Association hereby agrees to act as agent for the Lenders in respect of this Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, and upon the following terms and conditions: Section 9.1. Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including, without limitation, to execute Additional Borrower Assumption Agreements on behalf of the Lenders. Neither Agent nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, attorneys or employees shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be 64
taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), or be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, (b) be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or thereof on the part of Borrowers or any other Company, or the financial condition of Borrowers or any other Company, or (c) be liable to any of the Companies for consequential damages resulting from any breach of contract, tort or other wrong in connection with the negotiation, documentation, administration or collection of the Loans or Letters of Credit or any of the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in other Loan Documents with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Section 9.2. Note Holders. Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof (or, if there is no Note, the holder of the interest as reflected on the books and records of Agent) until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with Agent, signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to Agent. Section 9.3. Consultation With Counsel. Agent may consult with legal counsel selected by Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by Agent in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. Section 9.4. Documents. Agent shall not be under any duty to examine into or pass upon the validity, effectiveness, genuineness or value of any Loan Document or any other Related Writing furnished pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or the value of any collateral obtained hereunder, and Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine and what they purport to be. Section 9.5. Agent and Affiliates. LaSalle Bank National Association ("LaSalle") and its affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Companies and Affiliates as though LaSalle were not Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that, pursuant to such activities, LaSalle or its affiliates may receive information regarding any Company or any Affiliate (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Company or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to other Lenders. With respect to Loans and Letters of Credit (if any), LaSalle and its affiliates shall have the same rights and powers under 65
this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though LaSalle were not Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include LaSalle and its affiliates, to the extent applicable, in their individual capacities. Section 9.6. Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and agreed that Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred, unless Agent has been notified by a Lender in writing that such Lender believes that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and specifying the nature thereof or has been notified by a Borrower pursuant to Section 5.14 hereof. Section 9.7. Action by Agent. Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, so long as Agent shall be entitled, pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof, to assume that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent shall be entitled to use its discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any rights that may be vested in it by, or with respect to taking or refraining from taking any action or actions that it may be able to take under or in respect of, this Agreement. Agent shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, certificate, warranty or other paper or instrument believed by it to be genuine or authentic or to be signed by the proper party or parties, or with respect to anything that it may do or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its judgment, or that may seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the premises. Section 9.8. Release of Guarantor of Payment or Pledge of Stock. In the event of a merger, sale of assets or other transaction permitted pursuant to Section 5.12 hereof and so long as there is no Default or Event of Default existing, Agent, at the request and expense of US Borrowers, is hereby authorized by the Lenders to release, in connection therewith, one or more Guarantors of Payment or pledge of stock, as appropriate, upon the written request of Administrative Borrower. Section 9.9. Notices, Default. In the event that Agent shall (a) have been notified by a Lender in writing that such Lender believes that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (b) have actual knowledge of a Default or Event of Default due to the default in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders, Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and shall take such action and assert such rights under this Agreement as the Required Lenders shall direct and Agent shall inform the other Lenders in writing of the action taken. Agent may take such action and assert such rights as it deems to be advisable, in its discretion, for the protection of the interests of the holders of the Obligations. Section 9.10. Delegation of Duties. Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 66
Section 9.11. Indemnification of Agent. The Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers) ratably, according to their respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in its capacity as agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by Agent with respect to this Agreement or any Loan Document, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), or from any action taken or omitted by Agent in any capacity other than as agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. No action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.11. The undertaking in this Section 9.11 shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, if any, expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit, termination of the Commitment, any foreclosure under, or modification, release or discharge of, any or all of the Loan Documents, termination of this Agreement and the resignation or replacement of the agent. Section 9.12. Successor Agent. Agent may resign as agent hereunder by giving not fewer than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Administrative Borrower and the Lenders. If Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders (with the consent of Administrative Borrower so long as an Event of Default has not occurred and which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), or (b) if a successor agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day period following Agent's notice to the Lenders of its resignation, then Agent shall appoint a successor agent that shall serve as agent until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent. Upon its appointment, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties as agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor effective upon its appointment, and the former agent's rights, powers and duties as agent shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. Section 9.13. Fronting Lender. The Fronting Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by the Fronting Lender and the documents associated therewith. The Fronting Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (a) provided to Agent in Article IX hereof with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Fronting Lender in connection with the Letters of Credit and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent", as used in Article IX hereof, included the Fronting Lender with respect to such acts or omissions, and (b) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to the Fronting Lender. Section 9.14. Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, (a) Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by 67
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Agent shall have made any demand on Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to (i) file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and Agent) allowed in such judicial proceedings, and (ii) collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and (b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to Agent and, in the event that Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Agent. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. Section 9.15. Other Agents. As used in this Agreement, the term "Agent" shall only include Agent. None of the Syndication Agent, Co-Documentation Agents or Managing Agent shall have any rights, obligations or responsibilities hereunder in such capacity. ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.1. Lenders' Independent Investigation. Each Lender, by its signature to this Agreement, acknowledges and agrees that Agent has made no representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the creditworthiness, financial condition, or any other condition of any Company or with respect to the statements contained in any information memorandum furnished in connection herewith or in any other oral or written communication between Agent and such Lender. Each Lender represents that it has made and shall continue to make its own independent investigation of the creditworthiness, financial condition and affairs of the Companies in connection with the extension of credit hereunder, and agrees that Agent has no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto (other than such notices as may be expressly required to be given by Agent to the Lenders hereunder), whether coming into its possession before the first Credit Event hereunder or at any time or times thereafter. Each Lender further represents that it has reviewed each of the Loan Documents. Section 10.2. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No omission or course of dealing on the part of Agent, any Lender or the holder of any Note (or, if there is no Note, the holder of the interest as reflected on the books and records of Agent) in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder or under any of 68
the Loan Documents. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and in addition to any other rights, powers or privileges held by operation of law, by contract or otherwise. Section 10.3. Amendments, Waivers and Consents. (a) General Rule. No amendment, modification, termination, or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document nor consent to any variance therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. (b) Exceptions to the General Rule. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall (i) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) extend the date scheduled for payment of any principal (excluding mandatory prepayments) of or interest on the Loans or any fees payable hereunder without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, the rate of interest thereon or any fees payable hereunder, without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (except for periodic adjustments of interest rates and fees resulting from a change in the Applicable Margin as provided for in this Agreement), (iv) except pursuant to Section 9.8 hereof, release any party from its obligations under any Guaranty of Payment or Pledge Agreement, or (v) change any percentage voting requirement, voting rights, or the Required Lenders definition in this Agreement, or amend this Section 10.3 or Section 8.5 hereof. Furthermore, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) no provision of this Agreement affecting Agent in its capacity as such shall be amended, modified or waived without the consent of Agent; (B) no provision of this Agreement relating to the rights or duties of the Fronting Lender in its capacity as such shall be amended, modified or waived without the consent of the Fronting Lender; and (C) no provision of this Agreement relating to the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender in its capacity as such shall be amended, modified or waived without the consent of the Swing Line Lender. (c) Generally. Notice of amendments or consents ratified by the Lenders hereunder shall be forwarded by Agent to all of the Lenders. Each Lender or other holder of a Note (or interest in any Loan) shall be bound by any amendment, waiver or consent obtained as authorized by this Section 10.3, regardless of its failure to agree thereto. Section 10.4. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and, if to a Borrower, mailed or delivered to it, addressed to it at the address specified on the signature pages of this Agreement, if to a Lender, mailed or delivered to it, addressed to the address of such Lender specified on the signature pages of this Agreement, or, as to each party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to each of the other parties. All notices, statements, requests, demands and other communications provided for hereunder shall be deemed to be given or made when hand-delivered, delivered by overnight courier or two Business Days after being deposited in the mails with postage prepaid by registered or certified mail, addressed as aforesaid, or sent by facsimile with telephonic confirmation of receipt (if received during a Business Day, otherwise by telephonic confirmation of receipt the following Business Day), except that notices from a 69
Borrower to Agent or the Lenders pursuant to any of the provisions hereof shall not be effective until received by Agent or the Lenders, as the case may be. For purposes of Article II hereof, Agent shall be entitled to rely on telephonic instructions from any person that Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Officer of a Borrower, and Borrowers shall hold Agent and each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense resulting from any such reliance. Section 10.5. Costs, Expenses and Taxes. US Borrowers agree to pay on demand all reasonable and properly documented costs and expenses of Agent, including, but not limited to, (a) syndication, administration, travel and out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees and expenses, of Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation and closing of the Loan Documents and the administration of the Loan Documents, the collection and disbursement of all funds hereunder and the other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, and (b) the reasonable and properly documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses of special counsel for Agent, with respect to the foregoing, and of local counsel, if any, who may be retained by said special counsel with respect thereto. US Borrowers and any appropriate Foreign Borrower also agree to pay on demand all properly documented costs and expenses of Agent and the Lenders, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, in connection with the restructuring or enforcement of the Obligations, this Agreement or any Related Writing. In addition, US Borrowers and any appropriate Foreign Borrower shall pay any and all properly documented stamp, transfer, documentary and other taxes, assessments, charges and fees payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and the other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, and agree to hold Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or failure to pay such taxes or fees, other than those liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent, or, with respect to amounts owing to a Lender, such Lender, in each case as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. All obligations provided for in this Section 10.5 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Section 10.6. Indemnification. Each US Borrower, and each Foreign Borrower to the extent relating to the Loans and other credit extensions to such Foreign Borrower, agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Agent and the Lenders (and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, attorneys, agents and employees) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent or any Lender in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Lender or Agent shall be designated a party thereto) or any other claim by any Person relating to or arising out of any Loan Document or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of the Loans or any of the Obligations, or any activities of any Company or its Affiliates; provided that no Lender nor Agent shall have the right to be indemnified under this Section 10.6 for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. All obligations provided for in this Section 10.6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Section 10.7. Obligations Several; No Fiduciary Obligations. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by Agent or the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute Agent or the 70
Lenders a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity. No default by any Lender hereunder shall excuse the other Lenders from any obligation under this Agreement; but no Lender shall have or acquire any additional obligation of any kind by reason of such default. The relationship between Borrowers and the Lenders with respect to the Loan Documents and the Related Writings is and shall be solely that of debtors and creditors, respectively, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary obligation toward any Credit Party with respect to any such documents or the transactions contemplated thereby. Section 10.8. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts and by facsimile signature, each of which counterparts when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same agreement. Section 10.9. Binding Effect; Borrowers' Assignment. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by each Borrower, Agent and each Lender and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Borrower, Agent and each of the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Agent and all of the Lenders. Section 10.10. Lender Assignments. (a) Assignments of Commitments. Each Lender shall have the right at any time or times to assign to an Eligible Transferee (other than to a Lender that shall not be in compliance with this Agreement), without recourse, all or a percentage of all of the following: (i) such Lender's Commitment, (ii) all Loans made by that Lender, (iii) such Lender's Notes, and (iv) such Lender's interest in any Letter of Credit or Swing Loan, and any participation purchased pursuant to Section 2.2(b), 2.2(c) or 8.5 hereof. (b) Prior Consent. No assignment may be consummated pursuant to this Section 10.10 without the prior written consent of Administrative Borrower and Agent (other than an assignment by any Lender to any affiliate of such Lender which affiliate is an Eligible Transferee and either wholly-owned by a Lender or is wholly-owned by a Person that wholly owns, either directly or indirectly, such Lender, or to another Lender), which consent of Administrative Borrower and Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided that a failure of Administrative Borrower to approve a distressed debt fund or vulture fund as an Eligible Transferee shall not be deemed to be unreasonable); provided, however, that (i) Administrative Borrower's consent shall not be required if, at the time of the proposed assignment, any Default or Event of Default shall then exist, and (ii) Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to have granted its consent unless Administrative Borrower has expressly objected to such assignment within three Business Days after notice thereof. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time make a collateral assignment of all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, and no such assignment shall release such assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. 71
(c) Minimum Amount. Each such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of the assignor's Commitment and interest herein or the entire amount of the assignor's Commitment and interest herein.

Unless the assignment shall be to an affiliate of the assignor or the assignment shall be due to merger of the assignor or for regulatory purposes, either the assignor or the assignee shall remit to Agent, for its own account, an administrative fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500). (e) Assignment Agreement. Unless the assignment shall be due to merger of the assignor or a collateral assignment for regulatory purposes, the assignor shall (i) cause the assignee to execute and deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent an Assignment Agreement, and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause the assignee to execute and deliver, as the case may be, to Agent such additional amendments, assurances and other writings as Agent may reasonably require. (f) Non-U.S. Assignee. If the assignment is to be made to an assignee that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the assignor Lender shall cause such assignee, at least five Business Days prior to the effective date of such assignment, (i) to represent to the assignor Lender (for the benefit of the assignor Lender, Agent and Borrowers) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by Agent, Borrowers or the assignor with respect to any payments to be made to such assignee in respect of the Loans hereunder, (ii) to furnish to the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the Register (as defined below), Agent and Borrowers) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, as applicable (wherein such assignee claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments hereunder), and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the assignor, Agent and Borrowers) to provide to the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the Register, to Agent and Borrowers) a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN, as applicable, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such assignee, and to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such withholding tax exemption. (g) Deliveries by Borrowers. Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements specified in subsections (a) through (f) above, (i) Administrative Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent, the assignor and the assignee, any consent or release (of all or a portion of the obligations of the assignor) required to be delivered by Administrative Borrower in connection with the Assignment Agreement, and (ii) the appropriate Borrower shall execute and deliver to the assignee, if requested, and the assignor, if applicable, an appropriate Note or Notes. After delivery of the new Note or Notes, the assignor's Note or Notes, if any, being replaced shall be returned to the appropriate Borrower marked "replaced". (h) Effect of Assignment. Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements set forth in subsections (a) through (g) above, and any other condition contained in this Section 10.10, (i) the assignee shall become and thereafter be deemed to be a "Lender" for the purposes of this 72
Agreement, (ii) the assignor shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the extent that its interest has been assigned, (iii) in the event that the assignor's entire interest has been assigned, the assignor shall cease to be and thereafter shall no longer be deemed to be a "Lender" and (iv) the signature pages hereto and Schedule 1 hereto shall be automatically amended, without further action, to reflect the result of any such assignment. (i) Agent to Maintain Register. Agent shall maintain at the address for notices referred to in Section 10.4 hereof a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Administrative Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Section 10.11. Sale of Participations. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell participations to one or more Eligible Transferees (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights or obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of the Commitment and the Loans and participations owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it); provided that: (a) any such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged; (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (c) the parties hereto shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents; (d) such Participant shall be bound by the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof, and the Lender selling such participation shall obtain from such Participant a written confirmation of its agreement to be so bound; and (e) no Participant (unless such Participant is itself a Lender) shall be entitled to require such Lender to take or refrain from taking action under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document, except that such Lender may agree with such Participant that such Lender will not, without such Participant's consent, take action of the type described as follows: (i) increase the portion of the participation amount of any Participant over the amount thereof then in effect, or extend the Commitment Period, without the written consent of each Participant affected thereby; or 73
(ii) reduce the principal amount of or extend the time for any payment of principal of any Loan, or reduce the rate of interest or extend the time for payment of interest on any Loan, or reduce the facility fee, without the written consent of each Participant affected thereby. Borrowers agree that any Lender that sells participations pursuant to this Section 10.11 shall still be entitled to the benefits of Article III hereof, notwithstanding any such transfer; provided, however, that the obligations of Borrowers shall not increase as a result of such transfer and Borrowers shall have no obligation to any Participant. Section 10.12. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any other party) hereby notifies the Credit Parties that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, such Lender and Agent are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Credit Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Credit Parties and other information that will allow such Lender or Agent, as applicable, to identify the Credit Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act. Administrative Borrower shall provide, to the extent commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by Agent or a Lender in order to assist Agent or such Lender in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act. Section 10.13. Severability of Provisions; Captions; Attachments. Any provision of this Agreement that shall be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. The several captions to Sections and subsections herein are inserted for convenience only and shall be ignored in interpreting the provisions of this Agreement. Each schedule or exhibit attached to this Agreement shall be incorporated herein and shall be deemed to be a part hereof. Section 10.14. Investment Purpose. Each of the Lenders represents and warrants to Borrowers that it is entering into this Agreement with the present intention of acquiring any Note issued pursuant hereto (or, if there is no Note, the interest as reflected on the books and records of Agent) for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of distribution or resale, it being understood, however, that each Lender shall at all times retain full control over the disposition of its assets. Section 10.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, any Note and any other Loan Document or other agreement, document or instrument attached hereto or executed on or as of the Closing Date integrate all of the terms and conditions mentioned herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral representations and negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof. Section 10.16. Confidentiality. Agent and each Lender shall hold all Confidential Information in accordance with the customary procedures of Agent or such Lender for handling confidential information of this nature, and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent or any Lender may in any event make disclosures of, and 74
furnish copies of Confidential Information (a) to another agent under this Agreement or another Lender; (b) when reasonably required by any bona fide transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated transfer of any Loans or Commitment or participation therein (provided that each such prospective transferee or participant shall agree to the confidentiality provisions as set forth in this Section 10.16); (c) to the parent corporation or other affiliates of Agent or such Lender, and to their respective auditors and attorneys; and (d) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof, or pursuant to legal process, provided, that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall notify the chief financial officer of Administrative Borrower of any request by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of Agent or such Lender by such Governmental Authority), and of any other request pursuant to legal process, for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such Confidential Information. In no event shall Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by or on behalf of any Company. Borrowers hereby agree that the failure of Agent or any Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.16 shall not relieve Borrowers of any of the obligations to Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 10.17. Legal Representation of Parties. The Loan Documents were negotiated by the parties with the benefit of legal representation and any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be construed or interpreted against any party shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof or thereof. Section 10.18. Currency. (a) Currency Equivalent Generally. For the purposes of making valuations or computations under this Agreement (but not for the purposes of the preparation of any financial statements delivered pursuant hereto), unless expressly provided otherwise, where a reference is made to a dollar amount the amount is to be considered as the amount in Dollars and, therefor, each other currency shall be converted into the Dollar Equivalent. (b) Judgment Currency. If Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, obtains a judgment or judgments against any Credit Party in an Alternate Currency, the obligations of such Credit Party in respect of any sum adjudged to be due to Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the Notes (the "Judgment Amount") shall be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by Agent of the Judgment Amount in an Alternate Currency, Agent, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchases Dollars with the Judgment Amount in an Alternate Currency. If the amount of Dollars so purchased is less than the amount of Dollars that could have been purchased with the Judgment Amount on the date or dates the Judgment Amount (excluding the portion of the Judgment Amount that has accrued as a result of the failure of such Credit Party to pay the sum originally due hereunder or under the Notes when it was originally due and owing to Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the Notes) was originally due and owing to Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the Notes (the "Original Due Date") (the "Loss"), such Credit Party agrees as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against the Loss, and if the 75
amount of Dollars so purchased exceeds the amount of Dollars that could have been purchased with the Judgment Amount on the Original Due Date, Agent or such Lender agrees to remit such excess to such Credit Party. Section 10.19. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. (a) Governing Law. This Agreement, each of the Notes and any Related Writing shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the respective rights and obligations of Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders shall be governed by Ohio law, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Ohio state or federal court sitting in Cleveland, Ohio, over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Obligations or any Related Writing, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Ohio state or federal court. Each Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any action or proceeding in any such court as well as any right it may now or hereafter have to remove such action or proceeding, once commenced, to another court on the grounds of FORUM NON CONVENIENS or otherwise. Each Borrower agrees that a final, nonappealable judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

On November 8, 2005 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its earnings for the second quarter ended September 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
(c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: November 8, 2005
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  Nov. 8, 2005  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced its unaudited fiscal 2006 second-quarter and first-half results for the period ended September 30, 2005. For the quarter, the company's sales increased 11 percent to $405.6 million compared with $364.4 million for the second quarter last year.
Second-quarter sales of hardware products were $320.9 million, up 8.1 percent from $296.8 million last year. Software sales were $52.3 million, up 13.3 percent from $46.1 million a year ago, and services sales were $32.4 million, up 51.0 percent from $21.5 million last year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 13.1 percent of sales, compared with 13.3 percent in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $38.7 million, or 9.5 percent of sales for the quarter, compared with $39.2 million, or 10.8 percent, in the prior year.
Net income was up 78 percent to $6.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, including $2.5 million in restructuring charges. This compares with net income of $3.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the second quarter last year.
Excluding $2.5 million in restructuring charges, Agilysys would have reported non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) net income of $8.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, an increase of 113 percent compared with non-GAAP net income of $3.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the second quarter last year.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am very pleased with this quarter's performance both in terms of sales and profits. Our results continue to reflect growth in each of our major product categories  hardware, software and services  combined with a continued focus on improving operational efficiency and cost savings."
For the six months ended September 30, 2005, sales were $815.6 million, a nine percent increase over sales of $751.1 million reported for the comparable period last year. Gross margin for the first half was 12.7 percent of sales, compared with 12.9 percent in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $79.9 million, or 9.8 percent of sales for the first half, compared with $78.2 million, or 10.4 percent, in the prior year.
Six Months Results
The company recorded net income for the six months of $6.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with net income of $7.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, last year.
Excluding $4.9 million in restructuring charges reported in the first half and a non-recurring $4.8 million loss on redemption of the company's Convertible Trust Preferred Securities in the first quarter, the company would have reported non-GAAP net income of $12.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $7.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the first half of last year.
 
During the first half of 2006, Agilysys consolidated a portion of its operations to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. As part of that restructuring, the company eliminated certain jobs and exited specific leased facilities. Related to this initiative, Agilysys recorded restructuring charges of approximately $2.5 million in the second quarter and a total of $4.9 million during the first half of fiscal 2006. With the restructuring complete, the company expects to realize cost savings of approximately $6.0 million in the current fiscal year and approximately $7.0 million per year thereafter.
Restructuring Charges
As previously disclosed, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as part of its strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value, the company redeemed its 6.75 percent Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. Agilysys shareholders benefited from the elimination of the annual distribution on the Trust Preferred Securities, which amounted to approximately $5.2 million annually, net of tax, and the removal of 6.7 million shares of dilution.
Redemption of Convertible Trust Preferred Securities
As previously disclosed, on October 18, 2005, Agilysys terminated its three-year $100 million unsecured credit facility and entered into a $200 million five-year unsecured credit facility. The new credit facility includes a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements.
Agilysys Enters $200 Million Five-year Unsecured Credit Facility
The new credit facility will be used to retire existing debt when it matures, fund working capital and capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The facility contains covenants customary for such financings. The credit agreement can be reviewed on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2005.
The non-GAAP operating results provided are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist them in assessing and understanding the company's financial performance and underlying trends in its business, as management considers the charges and losses referred to above to be outside the company's core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accompanying this release is a tabular reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures with the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Agilysys expects to achieve results near the high end of its previous fiscal 2006 guidance of sales growth between five and seven percent over fiscal 2005 sales of $1.62 billion; gross margin of approximately 12.4 percent of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately 9.5 percent of sales; and the high end of the net income guidance of $0.80 to $0.88 per diluted share, which includes the impact of the restructuring charges and the loss on the redemption of the convertible trust preferred securities.
Business Outlook
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2006 capital expenditures between $2 and $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million, and interest expense to be partially offset by interest and other income, assuming no additional retirement of its Senior Notes.
A conference call to discuss the quarterly results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 8, 2005. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 23, 2005, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") with Arthur Rhein ("Rhein"), Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Agreement amends and restates the employment agreement between the Company and Rhein effective as of April 1, 2003, which was included as Exhibit 10(cc) to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. The Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Company will employ Rhein as President and Chief Executive Officer. The Agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Following is a description of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement:
The description of the Agreement set forth in this Item 1.01 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
In connection with entering into the Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors delivered a letter to Rhein, which letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, demonstrating an intention to grant to Rhein options to purchase a number of the Company's common Shares as follows: (i) on or about April 1, 2006, the option to purchase two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) of such shares; and (ii) on or about August 1, 2006, the option to purchase an additional two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) of such shares; with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the respective dates of grant, becoming exercisable during Rhein's continued employment at a rate of 10% March 31, 2007, an additional 30% March 31, 2008, and a final 60% March 31, 2009. There will be no acceleration of vesting due to Rhein's Retirement or termination for Good Reason as those words are defined in the Agreement and with further option provisions as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to the Agreement, when it grants such options; provided, however, that if the options referred to in (ii) above may not be granted because shares are not available, it is intended that the Compensation Committee will make a good faith effort to provide commensurate value in another form.

  Arthur Rhein   40 Stonehill Lane   Moreland Hills, Ohio 44022
or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith; except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
     14. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, heirs (in the case of Rhein) and permitted assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred in connection with the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee expressly assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The Company further agrees that, in the event of a sale or transfer of assets as described in the preceding sentence, it shall be a condition precedent to the consummation of any such transaction that the assignee or transferee expressly assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company hereunder. No rights or obligations of Rhein under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by Rhein other than Rhein's rights to compensation and benefits, which may be transferred only by will or operation of law, except as provided in this Section 14.
ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT
     Rhein shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under any applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefits payable hereunder following Rhein's death by giving the Company written notice thereof. In the absence of such a selection, any compensation or benefit payable under this Agreement following the death of Rhein shall be payable to Rhein's spouse, or if such spouse shall not survive Rhein, to Rhein's estate. In the event of Rhein's death or a judicial determination of Rhein's incompetence, reference in this Agreement to Rhein shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to Rhein's beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.
     15. . Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining portions hereof and such remaining portions of this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to replace such provision with another provision that will be valid or enforceable and that is as close as practicable to the provisions held invalid or unenforceable.
INVALID PROVISIONS
     16. . In the event this Agreement provides for payments or benefits to or on behalf of Rhein which cannot be provided under the Company's benefit plans, policies or arrangements either because such plans, policies or arrangements no longer exist or no longer provide such benefits or because provision of such benefits to Rhein would adversely affect the tax qualified or tax advantaged status of such plans, policies or arrangements for Rhein or other participants therein, the Company may provide Rhein with an "Alternative Benefit," as defined in this Section 16, in lieu thereof. The Alternative Benefit is a benefit or payment which places Rhein and Rhein's dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, in at least as good of an economic position as if the benefit promised by this Agreement (a) were
ALTERNATIVE SATISFACTION OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS
(18)
 
provided exactly as called for by this Agreement, and (b) had the favorable economic, tax and legal characteristics customary for plans, policies or arrangements of that type. Furthermore, if such adverse consequence would affect Rhein or Rhein's dependents, Rhein shall have the right to require that the Company provide such an Alternative Benefit.
     17. . Subject to the provisions of Section 18 hereof, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the employment of Rhein by the Company and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, and understandings of the Parties, whether oral or written. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, specifically referring hereto, and signed by both Parties.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATION
     18. . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 17, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Rhein's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company for its executive officers, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as Rhein has or may have under any stock option, restricted stock or other agreements with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Amounts which Rhein or Rhein's dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, are otherwise entitled to receive under any such plan, policy, practice or program shall not be reduced by this Agreement except as provided in Section 9 hereof with respect to payments under the Severance Benefit Plan if cash payments are made hereunder.
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
     19. . The failure at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to require performance by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provisions or to affect either the validity of this Agreement or any part of this Agreement or the right of either party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
WAIVER OF BREACH
     20. . This Agreement has been made in, and shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of, the State of Ohio, unless the Parties subsequently agree that the laws of another state shall govern. The Parties agree that this Agreement is not an "employee benefit plan" or part of an "employee benefit plan" which is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
GOVERNING LAW
     21. . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes or other amounts as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. Where withholding applies to Common Shares, the Company shall make cashless withholding available to Rhein if permissible by law.
WITHHOLDING
     22. .
EXPENSES
(19)
 
     23. . The Company represents and warrants that it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this Agreement and that the performance of its obligations under this Agreement will not violate any agreement between it and any other person, firm or organization.
REPRESENTATION
     24. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, to the extent it does not adversely affect Rhein, the Company may provide the compensation and benefits to which Rhein is entitled hereunder through one or more subsidiaries or affiliates.
SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES
     25. . In the event of any termination of employment, Rhein shall be under no obligation to seek other employment. Amounts due Rhein under this Agreement shall not be offset by any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment he may obtain.
NO MITIGATION OR OFFSET
     26. . The Parties agree that the remedies of each against the other for breach of this Agreement shall be limited to enforcement of this Agreement and recovery of the amounts and remedies provided for herein. The Parties, however, further agree that such limitation
SOLE REMEDY
(20)
 
shall not prevent either Party from proceeding against the other to recover for a claim other than under this Agreement.
     27. . If this Agreement is deemed by either Party not to comply with the final regulations under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Parties agree to modify this Agreement in a timely manner so that its terms comply so as to avoid penalties on Rhein while providing benefits as close to those agreed to herein as reasonably possible.
SECTION 409A
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Rhein have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  Feb. 9, 2006  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced its unaudited fiscal 2006 third-quarter and nine-months results for the period ended Dec. 31, 2005. For the quarter, the company's sales increased 3% to $532.2 million compared with $515.7 million for the third quarter last year.
Third-quarter sales of hardware products were $423.1 million, up 3% from $412.0 million last year. Software sales were $81.8 million, up 3% from $79.1 million a year ago, and services sales were $27.2 million, up 11% from $24.5 million last year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 13.2% of sales, compared with 12.8% in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.5 million, or 8.2% of sales for the quarter, compared with $39.7 million, or 7.7%, in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly driven by higher compensation and benefits costs, as well as higher bad debt expense.
Net income was $15.2 million, or 49 cents per diluted share. This compares with net income of $14.2 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter last year.
For the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2005, sales were $1.35 billion, a 6% increase over sales of $1.27 billion reported for the comparable period last year. Gross margin for the nine months was 12.9% of sales, consistent with 12.9% in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $123.4 million, or 9.2% of sales for the nine months, compared with $117.9 million, or 9.3%, in the prior year.
Nine-Months Results
The company recorded net income for the nine months of $22.1 million, or 70 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $21.8 million, or 70 cents per diluted share, last year.
Excluding $5.1 million in restructuring charges reported for the nine months and a non-recurring $4.8 million loss on redemption of the company's Convertible Trust Preferred Securities in the first quarter, the company would have reported a 27% increase in non-GAAP net income to $28.0 million compared with non-GAAP net income of $22.1 million in the prior year, or 88 cents per diluted share versus 71 cents per diluted share.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am pleased with our third-quarter results, which exhibited a number of positive trends including an improvement in gross margin and an increase in net income. In addition, our year-to-date results were strong with a 6% increase in sales and a 27% increase in non-GAAP net income."
During the first half of fiscal 2006, Agilysys consolidated a portion of its operations to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. As a result of this initiative, Agilysys recorded a total of $5.1 million in restructuring charges during the first nine months of fiscal 2006. As previously announced, the company expects to realize cost savings of approximately $6.0 million in the current fiscal year and approximately $7.0 million per year thereafter.
Restructuring Charges
 
As previously disclosed, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as part of its strategy to increase both financial flexibility and shareholder value, the company redeemed its 6.75% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. Agilysys shareholders benefited from the elimination of the annual distribution on the Trust Preferred Securities, which amounted to approximately $5.2 million annually, net of tax, and the removal of 6.7 million shares of dilution.
Redemption of Convertible Trust Preferred Securities
The non-GAAP operating results provided are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist them in assessing and understanding the company's financial performance and underlying trends in its business, as management considers the charges and losses referred to above to be outside the company's core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accompanying this release is a tabular reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures with the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Agilysys expects fiscal 2006 sales growth between 5% and 7% over fiscal 2005 sales of $1.62 billion; gross margin of approximately 12.9% of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately 9.6% of sales; and net income per diluted share of 80 to 88 cents, which includes the impact of the restructuring charges and the loss on the redemption of the convertible trust preferred securities. Excluding these one-time items, the company expects diluted earnings per share of 98 cents to $1.06 for the fiscal year. Based on year-to-date performance, Agilysys expects to achieve results near the high end of the ranges provided.
Business Outlook
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2006 capital expenditures of $3 to $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $11 million, and interest expense to be partially offset by interest and other income.
A conference call to discuss the quarterly results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2006. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

On May 22, 2006 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its fiscal 2006 fourth quarter and full-year results. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  May 22, 2006  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced fiscal 2006 unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year results for the periods ended March 31, 2006.
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were $394.7 million, an increase of 10.8% compared with sales of $356.2 million for the fourth quarter last year. The increase in revenues included sales growth across all of the company's major product categories.
Fourth-quarter sales of hardware products were $304.7 million, up 3% from $295.5 million last year. Software sales were $68.2 million, up 52% from $44.9 million a year ago. Services sales were $21.8 million, up 38% from $15.8 million last year.
Gross margin for the quarter increased to 13.9% of sales, compared with 12.5% in last year's fourth quarter. The improvement in gross margin is attributed to increases in supplier incentives (a component of gross margin), higher growth in direct sales to end-user customers and a sales mix shifting towards higher-margin software and services offerings.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $44.4 million, or 11.2% of sales compared with $46.6 million, or 13.1% of sales, in the prior year. The improvement is the result of restructuring executed earlier this year, as well as a more favorable comparison due to a one-time adjustment to employee benefit plans and non-recurring professional fees in the fourth quarter last year.
Fourth-quarter net income was $6.0 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.3 million, or a loss of eight cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter last year.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am extremely pleased with the fourth-quarter and full-year results we reported today. Our highly-skilled and motivated people continue to dedicate themselves to providing customers more complete enterprise computer technology solutions and our focus on higher-value is evident in our performance."
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, sales were $1.74 billion, an increase of 7.4% over the $1.62 billion in sales reported for the prior year.
Fiscal 2006 Full-Year Results
Full-year sales of hardware products were $1.38 billion, up 4% year over year. Software sales were $260.5 million, up 18% and services sales were $104.2 million, up 31%.
 
Gross margin was 13.1% of sales, up from 12.8% in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 9.6% of sales, from 10.1% in the prior year.
Net income increased to $28.1 million, or 89 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $19.5 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, last year.
During the first half of fiscal 2006, Agilysys consolidated a portion of its operations to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. As a result of this initiative, Agilysys recorded a total of $5.3 million in restructuring charges during fiscal 2006.
In addition and as previously disclosed, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company redeemed its 6.75% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. Agilysys shareholders benefited from the elimination of the annual distribution on the Trust Preferred Securities, which amounted to approximately $5.2 million annually, net of tax, and the removal of 6.7 million shares of dilution.
Excluding $5.3 million in restructuring charges reported for fiscal 2006 and a non-recurring $4.8 million loss on redemption of the company's Convertible Trust Preferred Securities in the first quarter, the company would have reported a 72% increase in non-GAAP net income to $34.0 million compared with non-GAAP net income of $19.8 million in the prior year, or $1.08 per diluted share versus 68 cents per diluted share in the prior year.
For the fiscal year Agilysys generated $50.0 million in cash flow from operations.
The non-GAAP operating results provided are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist them in assessing and understanding the company's financial performance and underlying trends in its business, as management considers the charges and losses referred to above to be outside the company's core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accompanying this release is a tabular reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures with the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
For fiscal 2007, the company currently estimates sales growth of 6% to 8% over fiscal 2006 sales of $1.74 billion.
Business Outlook
Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 12.9% of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 9.6% of sales for fiscal 2007. Net income for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.22 per diluted share and includes estimated stock option expensing of approximately $2.9 million or six cents per diluted share.
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2007 capital expenditures between $2 to $4 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million.
The company's Senior Notes are due in August 2006, at which time Agilysys will use existing cash reserves to retire the outstanding obligations. Assuming no reinvestment of cash, interest income is expected to exceed interest expense by approximately $1.2 million.
A conference call to discuss the quarterly and full-year results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Monday, May 22, 2006. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor

99.1      Press release issued by the Company dated July 25, 2006, announcing its preliminary fiscal 2007 first quarter results.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Agilysys Announces Preliminary First Quarter Results
BOCA RATON, Florida  July 25, 2006  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced preliminary results for its fiscal 2007 first quarter. Sales of approximately $388 million were down 5.3%, compared with $410 million for the first quarter of last year. Weaker sales were due to lower-than-expected sales of IBM hardware products, particularly weakness in proprietary servers.
The decrease in sales and resultant loss of gross profit were offset by higher gross margin of approximately 14.4% of sales, compared with 12.4% in the same period a year ago. The increase in gross margin was due to strong growth in software and services, and higher-than-anticipated profit earned on various supplier programs.
As a result, the company expects first quarter earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per diluted share. For the full year, the company reconfirms its May 22 guidance of $1.15 to $1.22 per share.
Arthur Rhein, Agilysys chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "While we are disappointed in the weakness in hardware products sales, we continue to see growth in our software and services categories, both of which helped drive the increase in gross margin."
Based on the preliminary first-quarter results, Agilysys is updating its previous guidance shared in its fourth quarter earnings release on May 22, 2006. The company now anticipates sales growth of approximately 4% to 6% for fiscal 2007 compared with the prior year. This compares with the company's previous fiscal 2007 guidance of approximately 6% to 8% sales growth.
Updated Fiscal 2007 Full-Year Outlook
Full-year gross margin is now expected to be approximately 13.2% of sales versus previous guidance of 12.9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are now anticipated to be approximately 9.8% of sales for fiscal 2007. As a result, fiscal 2007 earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.22 per share, in line with its May 22 guidance.
Agilysys will issue fiscal 2007 first quarter earnings on Thursday, August 3, 2006 and hold a conference call to discuss the results and the updated fiscal 2007 expectations at 11 a.m. ET. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on July 28, 2006, the shareholders of Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Agilysys, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan allows the Company to grant a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock options (with or without stock appreciation rights), time-vested restricted shares, performance-vested restricted shares and performance shares (shares granted upon the attainment of performance goals) to officers, other employees, directors and consultants selected by the Committee who has been charged with administering the Plan. The maximum number of Common Shares that may be issued under the Plan is 3.2 million shares. The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares that may be granted as restricted shares, restricted share units and performance shares under the Plan is 1.6 million shares. The aggregate number of Common Shares underlying awards granted under the Plan to any participant in any two consecutive fiscal year period, regardless of whether such awards are thereafter cancelled, terminated or forfeited, shall not exceed 1.6 million shares. The aggregate number of shares underlying awards granted under the Plan in any two consecutive fiscal year period shall not exceed the sum of 1.6 million shares (disregarding any shares underlying awards cancelled, terminated or forfeited during the period) plus the aggregate number of shares underlying awards previously cancelled or forfeited.
The Plan prohibits the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a stock option that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of such a stock option previously granted under the plan or any other modification to such a stock option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other stock market on which the Company's shares are traded.

     (oo) "Vested" means, regarding rights under this Plan, with respect to a Common Share, when the Common Share has been awarded; with respect to a Stock Option, that the time has been reached when the option to purchase Shares first becomes exercisable; with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right, when the Stock Appreciation Right first becomes exercisable for payment; with respect to Restricted Shares, when the Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transferability; with respect to Restricted Share Units and Performance Shares, when the units or Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture and are convertible to Shares. The words "Vest" and "Vesting" have meanings correlative to the foregoing. The fact that an Award is Vested does not mean that it is free of restrictions which may be imposed by law, nor even that the Award may not be forfeited in certain circumstances under the Plan (for example, due to a termination of employment or directorship for Cause).
     (2.1) .
Authority and Duties of the Committee
     (a) The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of at least three Directors who are appointed by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall serve as the Committee, and all of the members of the Committee shall be Outside Directors. Notwithstanding the requirement that the Committee consist exclusively of Outside Directors, no action or determination by the Committee or an individual then considered to be an Outside Director shall be deemed void because a member of the Committee or such individual fails to satisfy the requirements for being an Outside Director, except to the extent required by applicable law.
     (b) The Committee has the sole and exclusive power and authority to grant Awards pursuant to the terms of this Plan to officers, employees and Eligible Directors and consultants.

Delegation of Duties and Retention of Advisers
     2.3 . Members of the Board of Directors, members of the Committee and officers and employees of the Company or any Affiliate who are their designees acting under this Plan shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the advice of counsel and shall incur no liability except for gross or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties hereunder.
Limitation of Liability

Other Limitations
 
     (a) . The maximum number of Shares available with respect to all Stock Options (whether Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options) granted under this Plan is 3,200,00 Shares. Therefore, Stock Options on up to 3,200,000 Shares may be granted as Incentive Stock Options.
Option Limitation
     (b) . The maximum number of Shares available with respect to all Restricted Share, Restricted Share Unit and Performance Share Awards granted under this Plan is 1,600,000 Shares.
Full Value Share Limitation
     (c) .

The foregoing annual limitation is intended to include the grant of all Awards, including but not limited to, Awards representing Performance Based Compensation as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.
Per Participant Biannual Limitation
     (d) . The aggregate number of Shares underlying Awards granted under this Plan in any two consecutive fiscal year period of the Company, shall not exceed the sum of (i) 1,600,000 Shares (disregarding any Shares underlying Awards cancelled, terminated or forfeited during the period) plus (ii) the aggregate number of Shares underlying Awards previously cancelled, terminated or forfeited.
Overall Biannual Limitation
     3.3
Awards Not Exercised and Other Special Share Counting Rules.
     (a) If any outstanding Award, or portion thereof, expires, or is terminated, cancelled or forfeited, the Shares that would otherwise be issuable with respect to the unexercised portion of such expired, terminated, cancelled or forfeited Award shall be available for subsequent Awards under this Plan.
Awards Not Exercised.
     (b) . If the Exercise Price of an Award is paid in Shares, the Shares received by the Company in connection therewith shall not be added to the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be issued under Section 3.1 nor in any other manner become eligible for issuance under this Plan.
Shares Tendered in Payment
     (c) . If an Award of SARs is made, the number of Shares deemed subject to the Award shall equal the number of SARs awarded and each SAR exercised shall be counted as using one Share for purposes of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this Plan even though fewer Shares actually are issued to the Participant upon exercise.
Shares Reserved for SARs
     (d) . Shares sold or withheld to satisfy a Participant's withholding tax obligations upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Shares or the exercise of Options or SARs granted under the Plan or upon any other payment or issuance of Shares under the Plan shall not thereafter become available for issuance under the Plan.

     3.4 . In the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, redesignation, reclassification, merger, consolidation, liquidation, split-up, reverse split, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, then the Committee may, in such manner as it deems equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) which thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the limitations set forth above and (iv) the purchase or Exercise Price or any performance objective with respect to any Award; , that the number of Shares or other securities covered by any Award or to which such Award relates is always a whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing adjustments shall be made in compliance with: (i) Sections 422 and 424 of the Code with respect to ISOs and SARs related to ISOs; (ii) Treasury Department Regulation Section 1.424-1 (and any successor) with respect to NQSOs and SARs related to NQSOs, applied as if the NQSOs were ISOs; (iii) Section 409A of the Code, to the extent necessary to avoid its application or avoid adverse tax consequences thereunder; and (iv) Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to Awards granted to Section 162(m) Persons that are intended to be Performance Based Compensation, unless specifically determined otherwise by the Committee.
Dilution and Other Adjustments
provided, however
 
     4.1 . Officers, all other active common law employees of the Company or any of its Affiliates, Directors (each an "Eligible Director") and consultants who are selected by the Committee in its sole discretion are eligible to participate in this Plan. (See Article 13 and Article 17 with respect to the Shareholder approval requirement.) For purposes of determining eligibility, officers and employees of Affiliates who are not also officers or employees of the Company must hold such status with an Affiliate that has the necessary relationship for the Award to be granted (for example, the Affiliate must be a Parent or Subsidiary if an ISO is to be granted). Furthermore, if an Award is to be made to an officer, the officer must have the status necessary to receive such Award (for example, the officer must be an employee if an ISO is to be granted).
Eligibility
     4.2 . Awards are contingent upon the Participant's execution of a written Award Agreement in a form prescribed by the Committee. Execution of an Award Agreement shall constitute the Participant's irrevocable agreement (for himself and for anyone claiming through him such as an heir) to, and acceptance of, the terms and conditions of the Award set forth in such agreement and of the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to such Award, including, without limitation, any withholding tax requirement pursuant to Article 15. Award Agreements may differ from time to time and from Participant to Participant.
Award Agreements
     5.1 . Each Stock Option granted under this Plan will be evidenced by minutes of a meeting, or by a unanimous written consent without a meeting, of the Committee and by a written Award Agreement dated as of the Date of Grant and executed by the Company and by the appropriate Participant.
Option Grant
     5.2 . Stock Options granted under this Plan are subject to the following terms and conditions and may contain such additional terms, conditions, restrictions and contingencies with respect to exercisability and/or with respect to the Shares acquired upon exercise as may be provided in the relevant Award Agreements evidencing the Stock Options, so long as such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan and any operative employment or other agreement, as the Committee deems desirable:
Terms and Conditions of Grants
     (a) . Subject to Section 3.4, the Exercise Price will never be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Date of Grant. If a variable Exercise Price is specified at the time of grant, the Exercise Price may vary pursuant to a formula or other method established by the Committee; , that such formula or method will provide for a minimum Exercise Price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Date of Grant. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4, no subsequent amendment of an outstanding Stock Option may reduce the Exercise Price to less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Date of Grant. Nothing in this Section 5.2(a) shall be construed as limiting the Committee's authority to grant premium price Stock Options which do not become exercisable until the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares exceeds a specified percentage (for example, 110% of Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant for ISOs granted to a 10% or greater owner of the Company) of the Exercise Price; , that such percentage will never be less than 100%.
Exercise Price
provided, however
provided, however
     (b) . Any unexercised portion of a Stock Option granted hereunder shall expire at the end of the stated term of the Stock Option. The Committee shall determine the term of each Stock Option at the time of grant, which term shall not exceed 10 years from the Date of Grant. The Committee may extend the term of a Stock Option, in its discretion, but not beyond the date immediately prior to the tenth anniversary of the original Date of Grant. If a definite term is not specified by the Committee at the time of grant, then the term is deemed to be 10 years. Nothing in this Section 5.2(b) shall be construed as limiting the Committee's authority to grant Stock Options with a term shorter than 10 years.
Option Term
     (c) . Stock Options, or portions thereof, shall be exercisable at such time or times as determined by the Committee in its discretion at or after grant. If the Committee provides that any Stock Option becomes Vested over a period of time, in full or in installments, the Committee may waive or accelerate such Vesting provisions at any time. (Also, see the Change in Control provisions in Article 11.)
Vesting
     (d) . Vested portions of any Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option term by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. The notice must be given by or on behalf of a person entitled to exercise the Stock Option, accompanied
Method of Exercise
 
by payment in full of the Exercise Price, along with any withholding tax pursuant to Article 15. The Exercise Price may be paid:
     The Committee may suspend the use of any method of payment for any reason, in its sole discretion, including but not limited to concerns that the proposed method of payment will result in adverse financial accounting treatment for the Company, adverse tax treatment for the Company or a Participant or a violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
     If the Exercise Price of an NQSO is paid by tendering Restricted Shares, then the Shares received upon the exercise will contain identical restrictions as the Restricted Shares so tendered.
     Except as otherwise permitted by law and in the Committee's sole discretion, withholding tax may be paid only by cash or through a same day sale transaction.
     (e) . The Company will issue or cause to be issued Shares as soon as practicable upon exercise of the Option. No Shares will be issued until full payment has been made. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a Shareholder will exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
Issuance of Shares
     (f) . In general, a Stock Option Award Agreement will indicate whether the Stock Option is intended to be an ISO or a NQSO. Unless a Stock Option is designated as an ISO at the time of its grant, it shall be deemed to be an NQSO. ISOs are subject to the additional terms and conditions in Article 6.
Type of Option
     (g) . Unless the Committee provides otherwise, Stock Options awarded under this Plan are intended to meet the requirements for exclusion from coverage under Section 409A of the Code dealing with nonqualified deferred compensation and all Stock Option Awards shall be construed and administered accordingly.
Section 409A of the Code
     5.3 . Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, or otherwise provided in an employment or other agreement entered into between the Participant and the Company and approved by the Committee, either before or after the Date of Grant, and subject to Article 6 with respect to ISOs, the following early termination provisions apply to all Stock Options:
Termination of Grants Prior to Expiration
     (a) . If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates by reason of his death, all Stock Options held by such Participant will immediately become Vested, but thereafter may only be exercised (by the legal representative of the Participant's estate, or by the legatee or heir of the Participant pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution) for a period of one year (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after the time of grant) from the date of such death, or until the expiration of the original term of the Stock Option, whichever period is shorter.
Termination by Death
 
     (b) . If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates by reason of his Disability, all Stock Options held by such Participant will immediately become Vested, but thereafter may only be exercised for a period of one year (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after the time of grant) from the date of such termination, or until the expiration of the original term of the Stock Option, whichever period is shorter. If the Participant dies within such one year period (or such other period as applicable), any unexercised Stock Option held by such Participant will thereafter be exercisable by the legal representative of the Participant's estate, or by the legatee or heir of the Participant pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution, for the greater of the remainder of the one year period (or other period as applicable) or for a period of 12 months from the date of such death, but in no event shall any portion of the Stock Option be exercisable after its original stated expiration date.
Termination by Reason of Disability
     (c) . If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates by reason of his Retirement, all Stock Options held by such Participant immediately become Vested but thereafter may only be exercised for a period of two years (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after the time of grant) from the date of such Retirement, or until the expiration of the original term of the Stock Option, whichever period is shorter. If the Participant dies within such two year period (or such other period as applicable), any unexercised Stock Option held by such Participant will thereafter be exercisable by the legal representative of the Participant's estate, or by the legatee or heir of the Participant pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution, for the greater of the remainder of the two year period (or such other period as applicable) or for a period of 12 months from the date of such death, but in no event shall any portion of the Stock Option be exercisable after its original stated expiration date.
Termination by Reason of Retirement
     (d) . If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates is terminated for Cause, all Stock Options (or portions thereof) which have not been exercised, whether Vested or not, are automatically forfeited immediately upon termination.
Termination for Cause
     (e) If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates, voluntarily or involuntarily, for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or for Cause, any Vested portions of Stock Options held by such Participant at the time of termination may be exercised by the Participant for a period of three months (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after the time of grant) from the date of such termination or until the expiration of the original term of the Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter. No portion of any Stock Option which is not Vested at the time of such termination will thereafter become Vested.
Other Terminations.
     (f) . The Committee shall have authority to determine in each case whether an authorized leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of employment or directorship for purposes hereof, as well as the effect of a leave of absence on the vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if an entity ceases to be an Affiliate of the Company or otherwise ceases to be qualified under the Plan or if all or substantially all of the assets of an Affiliate of the Company are conveyed (other than by encumbrance), such cessation or action, as the case may be, shall be deemed for purposes hereof to be a termination of the employment or directorship.
Certain Committee Determinations
     5.4 . Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 3.4 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's Shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Option that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of such a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other stock market on which the Company's Shares are traded.
Repricing Prohibited
     6.1 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, an ISO may only be granted to full or part-time employees (including officers and Directors who are also employees) of the Company or of an Affiliate, provided that the Affiliate is a Parent or Subsidiary.
Eligibility
 
     6.2 .
Special ISO Rules
     (a) The Exercise Price fixed at the time of grant will not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the Date of Grant. If a variable Exercise Price is specified at the time of grant, the Exercise Price may vary pursuant to a formula or other method established by the Committee which provides a floor not less than Fair Market Value as of the Date of Grant. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4 hereof, dealing with the effects of certain corporate transactions, no subsequent amendment of an outstanding Stock Option may reduce the Exercise Price to less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the Date of Grant.
Exercise Price.
     (b) . No ISO may be exercisable on or after the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant, and no ISO may be granted under this Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of this Plan. (See the Plan effective date provisions in Article 17.)
Term
     (c) . No Participant may receive an ISO under this Plan if such Participant, at the time the Award is granted, owns (after application of the rules contained in Section 424(d) of the Code) equity securities possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of equity securities of the Company, its Parent or any Subsidiary, unless (i) the option price for such ISO is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the Date of Grant, and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable on or after the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant.
Ten Percent Shareholder
     (d) . The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined with respect to each ISO at the time of grant) of the Shares with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan adopted by the Company or its Parent or its Subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000. If such aggregate Fair Market Value shall exceed $100,000, such number of ISOs as shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the amount in excess of $100,000 shall be treated as NQSOs. This limitation shall be applied by taking Stock Options into account in the order in which granted.
Limitation on Grants
     (e) . Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no ISO granted hereunder (and, if applicable, related Stock Appreciation Right) may be transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, nor may such ISO (or related Stock Appreciation Right) be exercisable during a grantee's lifetime other than by him (or his guardian or legal representative to the extent permitted by applicable law).
Non-Transferability
     (f) . No ISO may be exercised more than three months following termination of employment for any reason (including Retirement) other than death or Disability, nor more than one year following termination of employment for the reason of death or Disability (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), or such option will no longer qualify as an ISO and shall thereafter be, and receive the tax treatment applicable to, an NQSO. For this purpose, a termination of employment is cessation of employment, under the rules applicable to ISOs, such that no employment relationship exists between the Participant and the Company, a Parent or a Subsidiary.
Termination of Employment
     (g) . For purposes of any ISO granted hereunder (or, if applicable, any related Stock Appreciation Right), the Fair Market Value of Shares shall be determined in the manner required by Section 422 of the Code applicable to ISOs.
Fair Market Value
     6.3 . Unless an Award Agreement for a Stock Option which is an ISO provides otherwise, it is intended that such Stock Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent that certain requirements applicable to "incentive stock options" under the Code shall not be satisfied.
Treatment as NQSO
     6.4 If Shares acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of within two years following the Date of Grant or one year following the transfer of such shares to the Participant upon exercise, the Participant shall, promptly following such disposition, notify the Company in writing of the date and terms of such disposition and provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Company may reasonably require.
Disqualifying Dispositions.
     6.5 . The foregoing limitations are designed to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code dealing with the tax qualification of ISOs and shall be so interpreted. Furthermore, if Section 422 of the Code is amended or modified, then, to the extent permitted by law, this Plan shall be deemed automatically amended or modified to comply with amendments or modifications to such Section 422. Any ISO which fails to comply with Section 422 of the Code automatically shall be treated as an NQSO appropriately granted under this Plan provided it otherwise meets the Plan's requirements for NQSOs.
Compliance with the Code
 
     7.1 . Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted under this Plan, either independently or in conjunction with the grant of a Stock Option. Each SAR granted under this Plan will be evidenced by minutes of a meeting, or by a unanimous written consent without a meeting, of the Committee and by a written Award Agreement dated as of the Date of Grant and executed by the Company and by the appropriate Participant.
SAR Grant and Agreement
     7.2 . Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any Stock Option granted under this Plan, either at the same time or after the grant of the Stock Option, and will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
SARs Granted in Conjunction with Option
     (a) . Each Stock Appreciation Right, or applicable portion thereof, granted with respect to a given Stock Option or portion thereof shall terminate and shall no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Stock Option, or applicable portion thereof.
Term
     (b) . A Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent that the Stock Option to which it relates is Vested and exercisable in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 or otherwise as the Committee may determine at or after the time of grant.
Exercisability
     (c) . A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by the surrender of the applicable portion of the related Stock Option. Stock Options which have been so surrendered, in whole or in part, are no longer exercisable to the extent the related Stock Appreciation Rights have been exercised and are deemed to have been exercised for the purpose of the limitation set forth in Article 3 on the number of Shares to be issued under this Plan, but only to the extent of the number of Shares actually issued under the Stock Appreciation Right at the time of exercise. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, subject to satisfaction of the withholding tax requirements pursuant to Article 15, the holder of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be entitled to receive Shares equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date over the Exercise Price per Share specified in the related Stock Option, multiplied by the number of Shares in respect of which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. At any time the Exercise Price per Share of the related Stock Option exceeds the Fair Market Value of one Share, the holder of the Stock Appreciation Right shall not be permitted to exercise such right
Method of Exercise
.
     7.3 . Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted by the Committee without related Stock Options, and independent Stock Appreciation Rights will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
Independent SARs
     (a) . Any unexercised portion of an independent Stock Appreciation Right granted hereunder shall expire at the end of the stated term of the Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee shall determine the term of each Stock Appreciation Right at the time of grant, which term shall not exceed 10 years from the Date of Grant. The Committee may extend the term of a Stock Appreciation Right, in its discretion, but not beyond the date immediately prior to the tenth anniversary of the original Date of Grant. If a definite term is not specified by the Committee at the time of grant, then the term is deemed to be ten years.
Term
     (b) . Subject to Section 3.4, the base or Exercise Price of an independent Stock Appreciation Right shall never be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Date of Grant.
Exercise Price
     (c) . A Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such time or times as determined by the Committee at or after the time of grant.
Exercisability
     (d) . A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised in whole or in part during the term by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of Shares in respect of which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. The notice must be given by or on behalf of a person entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, subject to satisfaction of the withholding tax requirements pursuant to Article 15, the holder of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be entitled to receive Shares equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date over the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant multiplied by the number of Stock Appreciation Rights being exercised. At any time the Fair Market Value of a Share on a proposed exercise date does not exceed the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant, the holder of the Stock Appreciation Right shall not be permitted to exercise such right.
Method of Exercise
 
     (e) . Unless otherwise provided in an employment or other agreement entered into between the holder of the Stock Appreciation Right and the Company and approved by the Committee, either before or after the Date of Grant, the early termination provisions set forth in Section 5.3 as applied to Non-Qualified Stock Options will apply to independent Stock Appreciation Rights.
Early Termination Prior to Expiration
     7.4 . Stock Appreciation Rights are subject to such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan and any operative employment or other agreement, as are determined from time to time by the Committee.
Other Terms and Conditions of SAR Grants
     7.5 . Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 3.4 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's Shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Appreciation Right that would have the effect of reducing the base price of such a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Appreciation Right that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by The Nasdaq Stock Market or other stock market on which the Company's Shares are traded.
Repricing Prohibited
     7.6 . Unless an Award Agreement approved by the Committee provides otherwise, Stock Appreciation Rights awarded under this Plan are intended to meet the requirements for exclusion from coverage under Section 409A of the Code dealing with nonqualified deferred compensation and all Stock Appreciation Rights Awards shall be construed and administered accordingly.
Section 409A of the Code
     8.1 . Restricted Share Awards consist of Shares which are issued by the Company to a Participant at no cost or at a purchase price determined by the Committee which may be below their Fair Market Value but which are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the Participant. Each Restricted Share Award granted under this Plan will be evidenced by minutes of a meeting, or by a unanimous written consent without a meeting, of the Committee and by a written Award Agreement dated as of the Date of Grant and executed by the Company and by the Participant. The timing of Restricted Share Awards and the number of Shares to be issued (subject to Section 3.2) are to be determined by the Committee in its discretion.
Restricted Share Grants and Agreements
     8.2 . Restricted Shares granted under this Plan are subject to the following terms and conditions, which, except as otherwise provided herein, need not be the same for each Participant, and may contain such additional terms, conditions, restrictions and contingencies not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan and any operative employment or other agreement, as the Committee deems desirable:
Terms and Conditions of Restricted Share Grants
     (a) . The Committee shall determine the prices, if any, at which Restricted Shares are to be issued to a Participant, which may vary from time to time and from Participant to Participant and which may be below the Fair Market Value of such Restricted Shares at the Date of Grant, including, without limitation, a price of zero.
Purchase Price
     (b) . All Restricted Shares issued under this Plan will be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may determine, which may include, without limitation, the following:
Restrictions
 
The Committee may at any time waive such restrictions or accelerate the date or dates on which the restrictions will lapse. However, if the Committee determines that restrictions lapse upon the attainment of specified performance objectives, then the provisions of Sections 9.2 and 9.3 will apply (including, but not limited to, the enumerated performance objectives). If the Award Agreement for a Section 162(m) Person provides that such Award is intended to qualify as Performance Based Compensation, the provisions of Section 9.4(d) also will apply.
     (c) . Restricted Shares will be registered in the name of the Participant and deposited, together with a Stock Power, with the Company or its agent. Each such certificate will bear a legend in substantially the following form:
Delivery of Shares
     "The transferability of this certificate and the Common Shares represented by it are subject to the terms and conditions (including conditions of forfeiture) contained in the Agilysys, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and an Award Agreement entered into between the registered owner and the Company. A copy of this Plan and Award Agreement are on file in the office of the Secretary of the Company."
     At the end of any time period during which the Restricted Shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transfer, such Shares remaining after any tax withholding has occurred pursuant to Article 15, will be delivered free of all restrictions (except for any pursuant to Section 14.2) to the Participant or other appropriate person and with the foregoing legend removed.
     (d) . If a Participant who holds Restricted Shares fails to satisfy the restrictions, Vesting requirements and other conditions relating to the Restricted Shares prior to the lapse, satisfaction or waiver of such restrictions and conditions, except as may otherwise be determined by the Committee, the Participant shall forfeit the Shares and transfer them back to the Company in exchange for a refund of any consideration paid by the Participant or such other amount which may be specifically set forth in the Award Agreement. A Participant shall execute and deliver to the Company one or more Stock Powers with respect to Restricted Shares granted to such Participant.
Forfeiture of Shares
     (e) . Except as otherwise required for compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, other applicable law and the terms of the applicable Restricted Share agreement, during any period in which Restricted Shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transfer, the Participant holding such Restricted Shares shall have all the rights of a Shareholder with respect to such Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive any dividends paid with respect to such Shares.
Voting and Other Rights
     (f) . If a Participant makes an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to a Restricted Share Award, the Participant shall file, within 30 days following the Date of Grant, a copy of such election with the Company and with the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with the regulations under Section 83(b) of the Code. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that the Restricted Share Award is conditioned upon the Participant's making or refraining from making an election with respect to the Award under Section 83(b) of the Code.
Section 
83(b)
Election
     8.3 . Restricted Share Unit Awards consist of Shares that will be issued to a Participant at a future time or times at no cost or at a purchase price determined by the Committee which may be below their Fair Market Value if continued employment, continued directorship and/or other terms and conditions specified by the Committee are satisfied. Each Restricted Share Unit Award granted under this Plan will be evidenced by minutes of a meeting, or by a unanimous written consent without a meeting, of the Committee and by a written Award Agreement dated as of the Date of Grant and executed by the Company and the Plan Participant. The timing of Restricted
Restricted Share Unit Awards and Agreements
 
Share Unit Awards and the number of Restricted Share Units to be awarded (subject to Section 3.2) are to be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
     8.4 . Restricted Share Unit Awards are subject to the following terms and conditions, which, except as otherwise provided herein, need not be the same for each Participant, and may contain such additional terms, conditions, restrictions and contingencies not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan and any operative employment or other agreement, as the Committee deems desirable:
Terms and Conditions of Restricted Share Unit Awards
     (a) . The Committee shall determine the prices, if any, at which Shares are to be issued to a Participant after Vesting of Restricted Share Units, which may vary from time to time and among Participants and which may be below the Fair Market Value of Shares at the Date of Grant, including, without limitation, a price of zero.
Purchase Price
     (b) . All Restricted Share Units awarded under this Plan will be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may determine, which may include, without limitation, the following:
Restrictions
The Committee may at any time waive such restrictions or accelerate the date or dates on which the restrictions will lapse.
     (c) . The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide restrictions that lapse upon the attainment of specified performance objectives. In such case, the provisions of Sections 9.2 and 9.3 will apply (including, but not limited to, the enumerated performance objectives). If the written Award Agreement for a Section 162(m) Person provides that such Award is intended to be Performance Based Compensation, the provisions of Section 9.4(d) also will apply.
Performance Based Restrictions
     (d) . A Participant holding Restricted Share Units shall not be deemed to be a Shareholder solely because of such units. Such Participant shall have no rights of a Shareholder with respect to such units; , that an Award Agreement may provide for payment of an amount of money (or Shares with a Fair Market Value equivalent to such amount) equal to the dividends paid from time to time on the number of Common Shares that would become payable upon vesting of a Restricted Share Unit Award.
Voting and Other Rights
provided, however
     (e) . If a Participant who holds Restricted Share Units satisfies the restrictions and other conditions relating to the Restricted Share Units prior to the lapse or waiver of such restrictions and conditions, the Restricted Share Units shall be converted to, or replaced with, Shares which are free of all restrictions except for any restrictions pursuant to Section 14.2.
Lapse of Restrictions
     (f) . If a Participant who holds Restricted Share Units fails to satisfy the restrictions, Vesting requirements and other conditions relating to the Restricted Share Units prior to the lapse,
Forfeiture of Restricted Share Units
 
satisfaction or waiver of such restrictions and conditions, except as may otherwise be determined by the Committee, the Participant shall forfeit the Restricted Share Units.
     (g) . A Restricted Share Unit Award or unearned portion thereof will terminate without the issuance of Shares on the termination date specified on the Date of Grant or upon the termination of employment or directorship of the Participant during the Performance Period. If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates by reason of his death, Disability or Retirement, the Committee in its discretion at or after the Date of Grant may determine that the Participant (or the heir, legatee or legal representative of the Participant's estate) will receive a distribution of Shares in an amount which is not more than the number of Shares which would have been earned by the Participant if 100% of the performance objectives for the current Performance Period had been achieved prorated based on the ratio of the number of months of active employment in the Performance Period to the total number of months in the Performance Period. However, with respect to Awards intended to be Performance Based Compensation (as described in Section 9.4(d)), distribution of the Shares shall not be made prior to attainment of the relevant performance objectives.
Termination
     (h) . Unless an Award Agreement approved by the Committee provides otherwise, Restricted Share Units awarded under this Plan are intended to meet the requirements for exclusion from coverage under Section 409A of the Code or to otherwise avoid adverse tax consequences thereunder and all Restricted Share Unit Awards shall be construed and administered accordingly. The Committee reserves the right to substitute a definition of the term "Disability" which is derived from a statute or regulations (, Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) for the definition of such term set forth in this Plan, as it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion with respect to Restricted Share Unit Awards.
Section 409A of the Code
e.g.
     8.5 . Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units, or portions thereof, are exercisable at such time or times as determined by the Committee in its discretion at or after grant, subject to the restrictions on time Vesting set forth in this Section. If the Committee provides that any Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Unit Awards become Vested over time (with or without a performance component), the Committee may waive or accelerate such Vesting provisions at any time, subject to the restrictions on time Vesting set forth in this Section.
Time Vesting of Restricted Share and Restricted Share Unit Awards
     9.1 . A Performance Share Award is a right to receive Shares in the future conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may determine. Each Performance Share Award granted under this Plan will be evidenced by minutes of a meeting, or by a unanimous written consent without a meeting, of the Committee and by a written Award Agreement dated as of the Date of Grant and executed by the Company and by the Plan Participant. The timing of Performance Share Awards and the number of Shares covered by each Award (subject to Section 3.2) are to be determined by the Committee in its discretion.
Performance Share Awards and Agreements
     9.2 . At the time of grant of a Performance Share Award, the Committee will specify the performance objectives which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number of Shares that will be distributed to the Participant. The Committee will also specify the Performance Period. With respect to awards to Section 162(m) Persons intended to be Performance Based Compensation, the Committee may use performance objectives based on one or more of the following (or substantially similar) criteria: cash generation, profit, revenue, market share, profit or return ratios, Shareholder returns and/or specific, objective and measurable non financial objectives, stock price, sales, earnings per share, return on equity, costs, earnings, capital adjusted pre-tax earnings (economic profit), net income, operating income (including but not limited to EBIT or EBITDA), performance profit (operating income minus an allocated charge approximating the Company's cost of capital, before or after tax), gross margin, revenue, working capital, total assets, net assets, Shareholders' equity and cash flow. Performance objectives may include or exclude extraordinary charges, losses from discontinued operations, restatements and accounting changes and other unplanned special charges such as restructuring expenses, acquisitions, acquisition expenses, including expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, stock offerings, stock repurchases and loan loss provisions, provided that in the case of an Award intended to qualify for the exemption from the limitation on deductibility imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code that is set forth in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, such inclusion or exclusion shall be made in compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code. The Committee may designate a single objective or objectives for performance measurement purposes. Performance measurement may be based on absolute Company, business unit or divisional performance and/or
Performance Objectives
 
on performance as compared with that of other publicly-traded companies. The performance objectives and periods need not be the same for each Participant nor for each Award.
     9.3 . The Committee may modify, amend or otherwise adjust the performance objectives specified for outstanding Performance Share Awards if it determines that an adjustment would be consistent with the objectives of this Plan and taking into account the interests of the Participants and the public Shareholders of the Company and such adjustment complies with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code for Section 162(m) Persons, to the extent applicable, unless the Committee indicates a contrary intention. The types of events which could cause an adjustment in the performance objectives include, without limitation, accounting changes which substantially affect the determination of performance objectives, changes in applicable laws or regulations which affect the performance objectives, and divisive corporate reorganizations, including spin-offs and other distributions of property or stock.
Adjustment of Performance Objectives
     9.4 . Performance Share Awards granted under this Plan are subject to the following terms and conditions and may contain such additional terms, conditions, restrictions and contingencies not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan and any operative employment or other agreement as the Committee deems desirable:
Other Terms and Conditions
     (a) . As soon as practicable after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the Participant will receive a distribution of the number of Shares earned during the Performance Period, depending upon the extent to which the applicable performance objectives were achieved. Such Shares will be registered in the name of the Participant and will be free of all restrictions except for any restrictions pursuant to Section 14.2.
Delivery of Shares
     (b) . A Performance Share Award or unearned portion thereof will terminate without the issuance of Shares on the termination date specified at the time of grant or upon the termination of employment or directorship of the Participant during the Performance Period. If a Participant's employment or directorship with the Company or its Affiliates terminates by reason of his death, Disability or Retirement (except with respect to Section 162(m) Persons), the Committee in its discretion at or after the time of grant may determine, notwithstanding any Vesting requirements under Section 9.4(a), that the Participant (or the heir, legatee or legal representative of the Participant's estate) will receive a distribution of a portion of the Participant's then-outstanding Performance Share Awards in an amount which is not more than the number of Shares which would have been earned by the Participant if 100% of the performance objectives for the current Performance Period had been achieved prorated based on the ratio of the number of months of active employment in the Performance Period to the total number of months in the Performance Period. However, with respect to Awards intended to be Performance Based Compensation (as described in Section 9.4(d)), distribution of the Shares shall not be made prior to attainment of the relevant performance objective.
Termination
     (c) . Awards of Performance Shares do not provide the Participant with voting rights or rights to dividends prior to the Participant becoming the holder of record of Shares issued pursuant to an Award; , that an Award Agreement may provide for payment of an amount of money (or Shares with a Fair Market Value equivalent to such amount) equal to the dividends paid from time to time on the number of Common Shares that would become payable upon vesting of a Performance Share Award. Prior to the issuance of Shares, Performance Share Awards may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise encumbered.
Voting and Other Rights
provided, however
     (d) . The Committee may designate Performance Share Awards as being "remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals" as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code. Such Awards shall be automatically amended or modified to comply with amendments to Section 162 of the Code to the extent applicable, unless the Committee indicates a contrary intention.
Performance-Based Compensation
     9.5 . Performance Share Awards, or portions thereof, are exercisable at such time or times as determined by the Committee in its discretion at or after grant, subject to the restrictions on time Vesting set forth in this Section. If the Committee provides that any Performance Shares become Vested over time (accelerated by a performance component), the Committee may waive or accelerate such Vesting provisions at any time, subject to the restrictions on time Vesting set forth in this Section.
Time Vesting of Performance Share Awards
     9.6 . Unless an Award Agreement approved by the Committee provides otherwise, Performance Shares awarded under this Plan are intended to meet the requirements for exclusion from coverage under Section 409A of the Code or to otherwise avoid adverse tax consequences thereunder and all Performance Share Awards shall be construed and administered accordingly. The Committee reserves the right to substitute a definition of the term "Disability" which is derived from a statute or regulations (, Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of
Special Limitations on Performance Share Awards
e.g.
 
the Code) for the definition of such term set forth in this Plan, as it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion with respect to Performance Share Awards.
     10.1 . For purposes of this Plan, the transfer of a Participant among the Company and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment except as required by Section 422 of the Code with respect to ISOs or other applicable law including Section 409A of the Code, if relevant.
Transfer of Participant
     10.2 . For purposes of this Plan, the following leaves of absence are deemed not to be a termination of employment:
Effect of Leaves of Absence
     (a) a leave of absence, approved in writing by the Company, for military service, sickness or any other purpose approved by the Company, if the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days;
     (b) a leave of absence in excess of 90 days, approved in writing by the Company, but only if the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract, and provided that, in the case of any such leave of absence, the employee returns to work within 30 days after the end of such leave; and
     (c) any other absence determined by the Committee in its discretion not to constitute a termination of employment, to the extent such discretion is permitted by law including the applicable rules with respect to ISOs.
     11.1 "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
Change in Control Defined.
     (a) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold or transferred to another corporation or entity, or the Company is merged, consolidated or reorganized with or into another corporation or entity, with the result that upon conclusion of the transaction less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors ("Voting Stock") or other capital interests of the acquiring corporation or entity are owned, directly or indirectly, by the holders of Voting Stock of the Company generally prior to the transaction;
     (b) there is a report filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), excluding the Company, any Affiliate, any employee benefit plan of the Company or an Affiliate, including the trustee of any such plan has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding Voting Stock of the Company;
     (c) the Company shall file a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Item 1 of Form 8-K thereunder or Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A thereunder (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred or will or may occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
     (d) the individuals who, at the beginning of any period of two (2) consecutive calendar years, constituted the Directors of the Company cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof unless the nomination for election by the Company's Shareholders of each new Director of the Company was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Directors of the Company still in office who were Directors of the Company at the beginning of any such period.
     11.2 . Except as otherwise provided in this Plan or an Award Agreement, immediately upon the occurrence of a Change in Control:
Acceleration of Award
 
     (a) all outstanding Stock Options automatically become fully exercisable;
     (b) all Restricted Share Awards automatically become fully Vested;
     (c) all Restricted Share Unit Awards automatically become fully Vested (or, if such Restricted Share Unit Awards are subject to performance-based restrictions, shall become Vested on a pro-rated basis as described in Section 11.2(d) with respect to Performance Share Awards) and, to the extent Vested, convertible to Shares at the election of the holder;
     (d) all Participants holding Performance Share Awards become entitled to receive a partial payout in an amount which is the number of Shares which would have been earned by the Participant if 100% of the performance objectives for the current Performance Period had been achieved pro-rated based on the ratio of the number of months of active employment in the Performance Period to the total number of months in the Performance Period; and
     (e) Stock Appreciation Rights automatically become fully Vested and fully exercisable.
     12.1 . Except as provided in Sections 12.2 and 12.3, Awards are non-transferable and any attempts to assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise alienate or encumber (whether by operation of law or otherwise) any Award shall be null and void.
Awards Are Non-Transferable
     12.2 . During a Participant's lifetime, Awards are exercisable only by the Participant or, as permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding Section 12.1 to the contrary, the Participant's guardian or other legal representative.
Inter-Vivos Exercise of Awards
     12.3 . Notwithstanding Section 12.1 to the contrary, Awards may be transferred by will and by the laws of descent and distribution. Moreover, the Committee, in its discretion, may allow at or after the time of grant the transferability of Awards which are Vested, provided that the permitted transfer is made (a) if the Award is an Incentive Stock Option, the transfer is consistent with Section 422 of the Code; (b) to the Company (for example in the case of forfeiture of Restricted Shares), an Affiliate or a person acting as the agent of the foregoing or which is otherwise determined by the Committee to be in the interests of the Company; or (c) by the Participant for no consideration to Immediate Family Members or to a bona fide trust, partnership or other entity controlled by and for the benefit of one or more Immediate Family Members. "Immediate Family Members" means the Participant's spouse, children, stepchildren, parents, stepparents, siblings (including half brothers and sisters), in-laws and other individuals who have a relationship to the Participant arising because of a legal adoption. No transfer may be made to the extent that transferability would cause Form S-8 or any successor form thereto not to be available to register Shares related to an Award. The Committee in its discretion may impose additional terms and conditions upon transferability. Transfers are subject to prior Committee approval (except as provided in Section 12.3(b)) or they are null and void.
Limited Transferability of Certain Awards
     13.1 . The Board of Directors may amend, alter, or discontinue this Plan at any time, provided that no amendment, alteration, or discontinuance may be made:
Amendment or Discontinuation of this Plan
     (a) which would materially and adversely affect the rights of a Participant under any Award granted prior to the date such action is adopted by the Board of Directors without the Participant's written consent thereto; and
     (b) without Shareholder approval, if Shareholder approval is required under applicable laws, regulations or exchange requirements (including Section 422 of the Code with respect to ISOs, and for the purpose of qualification as Performance Based Compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Plan may be amended without Participants' consent to: (i) comply with any law; (ii) preserve any intended favorable tax effects for the Company, the Plan or Participants; or (iii) avoid any unintended unfavorable tax effects for the Company, the Plan or Participants.
 
     13.2 . The Committee may amend, prospectively or retroactively, the terms of any outstanding Award, provided that no such amendment may be inconsistent with the terms of this Plan (specifically including the prohibition on granting Stock Options with an Exercise Price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares on the Date of Grant) or would materially and adversely affect the rights of any holder without his written consent.
Amendment of Grants
     14.1 . The Company is not required to issue or deliver any certificates for Shares issuable with respect to Awards under this Plan prior to the fulfillment of all of the following conditions, to the extent applicable:
Delivery of Share Certificates
     (a) payment in full for the Shares and for any withholding tax (See Article 15);
     (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any Federal or state laws or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulating body which the Committee in its discretion deems necessary or advisable;
     (c) admission of such Shares to listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market or any stock exchange on which the Shares are listed;
     (d) in the event the Shares are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, qualification as a private placement under said Act;

     (f) the Committee is fully satisfied that the issuance and delivery of Shares under this Plan is in compliance with applicable Federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance or any rule or regulation of any other regulating body, for which the Committee may seek approval of counsel for the Company.
     14.2 . Shares issued with respect to Awards may be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may determine necessary or advisable under any applicable Federal or state securities law rules, regulations and other requirements, the rules, regulations and other requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market or any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any other applicable Federal or state law and will include any restrictive legends the Committee may deem appropriate to include.
Applicable Restrictions on Shares
     14.3 . In lieu of the issuance of stock certificates evidencing Shares, the Company may use a "book entry" system in which a computerized or manual entry is made in the records of the Company to evidence the issuance of such Shares. Such Company records are, absent manifest error, binding on all parties.
Book Entry
     15.1 . The Committee shall cause the Company to withhold any taxes which it determines it is required by law or required by the terms of this Plan to withhold in connection with any payments incident to this Plan. The Participant or other recipient shall provide the Committee with such Stock Powers and additional information or documentation as may be necessary for the Committee to discharge its obligations under this Section.
In General
     15.2 . With respect to a distribution in Shares pursuant to Restricted Share, Restricted Share Unit and Performance Share Awards under the Plan, the Committee shall cause the Company to sell the fewest number of such Shares for the proceeds of such sale to equal (or exceed by not more than that actual sale price of a single Share) the Participant's or other recipient's withholding tax liability, as set forth in Section 15.1, resulting from such distribution. The Committee shall withhold the proceeds of such sale for purposes of satisfying such withholding tax liability. In the event that a distribution in Shares does not result in any withholding tax liability as a result of the
Withholding from Share Distributions
 
Participant's election to be taxed at an earlier date or for any other reason, the Company shall not be required to sell any Shares distributed to the Participant.
     15.3 . The Committee shall cause the Company to deliver withholding proceeds to the Internal Revenue Service and/or other taxing authority in satisfaction of a Participant's or other recipient's tax liability arising from a payment.
Delivery of Withholding Proceeds
     16.1 . No one has any claim or right to be granted an Award under this Plan, and there is no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Participants under this Plan. Neither this Plan nor any Award thereunder shall be construed as giving any individual any right to continued employment or continued directorship with the Company or any Affiliate. The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or directorship, and the Company and each Affiliate expressly reserve the right at any time to terminate employees free from liability, or any claim, under this Plan, except as may be specifically provided in this Plan or in an Award Agreement.
No Implied Rights to Awards, Employment or Directorship
     16.2 . Nothing contained in this Plan prevents the Board of Directors from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to Shareholder approval if such approval is required, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
Other Compensation Plans
     16.3 . This Plan is intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3. All transactions involving any Participant subject to Section 16(a) shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 16b-3, regardless of whether such conditions are expressly set forth in this Plan. Any provision of this Plan that is contrary to Rule 16b-3 does not apply to such Participants.
Rule 16b-3 Compliance
     16.4 . This Plan is intended to comply with all applicable requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to Performance Based Compensation for Participants who are Section 162(m) Persons. Unless the Committee expressly determines otherwise, any provision of this Plan that is contrary to such requirements does not apply to such Participants.
Code
Section 162(m)
Compliance
     16.5 . All obligations of the Company with respect to Awards granted under this Plan are binding on any successor to the Company, whether as a result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
Successors
     16.6 . In the event any provision of this Plan, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, or other applications, and this Plan is to be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
Severability
     16.7 . To the extent not preempted by Federal law, this Plan and all Award Agreements pursuant thereto are construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio. This Plan is not intended to be governed by ERISA and shall be so construed and administered.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition; and
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On November 6, 2006 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal 2007 second quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: November 6, 2006
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  November 6, 2006  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, today announced fiscal 2007 unaudited second-quarter and first-half results for the periods ended September 30, 2006.
Consolidated sales for the second quarter were $385.5 million, a decrease of 5% compared with sales of $405.6 million for the second quarter last year. The decrease in sales was largely due to softness in demand for IBM products.
Second-quarter sales of hardware products were $301.8 million, down 6% from $320.9 million in last year's second quarter. Software sales were $53.2 million, up 1.7% from $52.3 million a year ago. Services sales were $30.5 million, down 5.9% from $32.4 million in last year's second quarter. The decrease in services sales was the result of lower sales of remarketed services. Sales of Agilysys proprietary services increased year over year.
Gross margin for the quarter increased to 13.4% of sales, compared with 13.1% in last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales is attributed to higher gross margin percentages in both the company's direct and distribution businesses, as well as higher relative growth in software sales.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter were $42.9 million, or 11.1% of sales, compared with $38.7 million, or 9.5% of sales, in the prior-year quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses was principally driven by higher compensation and benefits costs associated with investments for growth of the business, including approximately $1 million in operating expenses resulting from the company's entrance into China. Also included in the second-quarter SG&A expense is approximately $900,000 in stock option expense. Neither the China, nor stock option related expenses were recorded in the prior-year period.
Second-quarter net income was $5.5 million, or 18 cents per diluted share, compared with a net income of $6.7 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter last year, which included a $1.5 million, after tax, restructuring charge.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "Our revenue miss for the first half of the year is attributed to disappointing demand for IBM products. However, Agilysys is well positioned with its customers and we expect positive sales growth with all our key suppliers in our third quarter, which historically has accounted for approximately one-third of our annual revenues. Our investments continue to enhance our ability to provide customers solutions that are delivering differentiated value and are providing Agilysys with increasing gross margin as a percent of sales."
Six-Months Results
For the six months ended September 30, 2006, sales were $773.8 million, a 5.1% decrease compared with sales of $815.6 million reported for the comparable period last year.
 
First half sales of hardware products were $598.3 million, down 8% from $650.7 million in the first half of last year. Software sales were $117.8 million, up 5.9% from $111.2 million a year ago. Services sales were $57.7 million, up 7.4% from $53.7 million in last year's first six months.
Gross margin for the first half was 13.9% of sales, compared with 12.7% in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $86.6 million, or 11.2% of sales for the first half, compared with $79.9 million, or 9.8%, in the prior year.
The company recorded net income for the six months of $12.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with net income of $6.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, last year, which included $2.9 million, after tax, in restructuring charges and a non-recurring $2.8 million, after tax, loss on redemption of the company's Convertible Trust Preferred Securities.
Company Generates $33 Million in Cash from Operations in Second Quarter
Agilysys generated $33 million in cash from operations during the second quarter. The reversal of cash used by operations in the first quarter this fiscal year was driven by strong operating income and improvements in working capital. For the first six months of fiscal 2007 cash generated by operations was $9.4 million.
Retirement of $59.4 Million in Senior Notes
During the quarter, the company's 9.5% Senior Notes matured and were retired at a total cost of $62.2 million, of which $59.4 million was principal and $2.8 million was accrued interest. The company used available cash to fund the retirement. This marks the first time in more than 30 years that Agilysys is effectively debt-free.
Agilysys said the company is now positioned with significant financial flexibility, which it plans to use to continue enhancing offerings, through acquisition and the development of intellectual assets that further differentiate it in the market.
Business Outlook
Based on its second-quarter and first-half results, Agilysys revised its full-year guidance. The company now anticipates full-year sales to be approximately flat to up 2% over the prior year. Full-year gross margin is expected to be higher than originally anticipated at approximately 13.4% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately 10% of sales for fiscal 2007.
Agilysys added that stock option expense for the fiscal year is expected to be $3.9 million on a pre-tax basis. As a result, fiscal 2007 earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20 per share.
Agilysys also expects to incur fiscal 2007 capital expenditures between $2 million and $4 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $10 million.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: January 3, 2007
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
BOCA RATON, Fla.  Jan. 2, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of enterprise computer technology solutions, announced today that it will divest its distribution business to focus solely on growing its IT solutions business  the Enterprise Solutions Group (ESG)  a leading provider of innovative IT solutions to corporate and public sectors, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality.
The company has signed a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its KeyLink Systems Group (KSG) to Arrow Electronics (Arrow) for $485 million in cash. JPMorgan acted as financial advisor to Agilysys on this transaction and has provided the board of directors with a fairness opinion. Through the sale of KSG, Agilysys will exit all distribution-related businesses and exclusively sell directly to end-user customers. By monetizing the value of the KSG distribution assets, Agilysys will significantly increase its financial flexibility and redeploy the proceeds to accelerate the growth, both organically and through acquisition, of its IT solutions business.
In addition, the Agilysys board of directors has authorized the self tender offer to repurchase up to 6 million of its outstanding common shares, or approximately 20% of the company's outstanding shares. Agilysys currently expects to commence the estimated $100 million tender offer as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing of the proposed sale of KSG.
"Today's announcement will lead to the completion of the strategic transformation we began in 2003 when we exited the electronic components distribution business," said Arthur Rhein, Agilysys chairman, president and chief executive officer. "This decision reflects the successful expansion of our IT solutions business over the last four years, and the excellent long-term opportunities available to accelerate our growth as a solution provider. In addition, as we continue to position the company closer to the end customer, we will enhance our ability to provide differentiated value and greater rewards to customers and shareholders."
Agilysys Strategic Transformation
In 2002, Agilysys, working with third-party financial advisors, conducted a review of strategic alternatives, and as a result, developed a long-term strategic plan designed to increase the intrinsic value of the company. Since then, the company has been executing its strategy to reposition Agilysys closer to end customers and enhance its returns to shareholders. The first step was the divestiture of its electronic components distribution business (known as "IED") in 2003. Proceeds from that sale, combined with cash generated from operations, were used to retire long-term debt and accelerate growth of the IT solutions business, both organically and through acquisition.
Agilysys has successfully grown its IT solutions business from $276.7 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 to $469.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The growth was
 
supported by a series of acquisitions that strategically expanded the company's range of solutions and markets served, including:
The creation and successful execution of a strategy to redeploy the asset base in support of the growth of IT solutions has resulted in a more profitable business and the creation of significant value for shareholders. From a stock price of $8.93 prior to the IED divestiture announcement in January 2003 to the closing price of $16.74 prior to today's announcement, the stock price has increased $7.81, or 87%.
Sale of KeyLink Systems Group
KSG is a leading distributor of enterprise computer systems, selling to more than 800 reseller partners in North America. The business has significant distribution relationships with key enterprise suppliers including HP, IBM and Oracle. KSG accounted for 73%, or $1.24 billion, of Agilysys consolidated sales for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2006.
The agreement to sell substantially all the assets of KSG for a purchase price of $485 million in cash is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined at close. Taxes payable on the gain on sale are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Based on the purchase price of $485 million, Agilysys expects to net after-tax proceeds of $340 million.
While the company anticipates the sale of KSG will close by March 31, 2007, the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and Agilysys shareholder approval. Within two weeks, Agilysys will file a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will include pro forma financial statements reflecting the divestiture of KSG and other relevant information.
Rhein said, "Our KSG employees have been very successful in building a market leader and a profitable and growing business. While Arrow is purchasing KSG, more importantly it will be acquiring the skills and talents of a group of dedicated people who have built KSG into what it is today. I would like to thank our KSG employees for all their hard work and dedication, and express my confidence in the continued success of the business with Arrow, an industry leader in technology distribution. Over the next months, we will make every effort to facilitate a smooth transition for Arrow, our employees and our reseller partners. In addition, we are looking forward to a new relationship with Arrow through a product procurement agreement that will provide Agilysys access to a wide range of products and services."
Board Authorizes Repurchase of 6 Million Common Shares via Self-Tender
As part of the company's financial strategy to increase flexibility and create value for shareholders, the Agilysys board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 6 million Agilysys common shares, or
 
approximately 20% of the outstanding common shares. Agilysys will use a self-tender to return approximately $100 million to shareholders after the close of the sale of KSG.
The tender offer will provide a liquidity event for those shareholders who would like to exit the stock or realize liquidity for a portion of their ownership. It also provides Agilysys a tax-efficient mechanism to quickly distribute a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale of KSG to shareholders. Agilysys management and directors will not tender their shares into the self-tender offer.
Rhein added, "The self-tender is a strong signal from our board of directors that they are confident in our strategy to focus exclusively on selling IT solutions. It also provides a way to return cash to our shareholders, while enabling those who retain their shares to increase their proportionate ownership in the company."
The tender offer is the latest step in a number of actions the company has taken to increase financial flexibility and create value for shareholders. Over the last four years, Agilysys has significantly improved its balance sheet. Since the beginning of fiscal 2003, the company has retired $150 million of 9.5% Senior Notes and redeemed $143 million of 6.75% Convertible Preferred securities.
With all remaining portions of long-term debt retired in August 2006, the company became debt-free for the first time in more than 30 years. As of September 30, 2006, the company had $95.7 million in cash on hand. With operating cash flows and the net proceeds from the sale of KSG, the company expects to have in excess of $440 million in cash on hand at close.
The company intends to continue to pay its three-cent quarterly, or 12-cent annual, dividend per share.
New Strategic Direction and Business Outlook
Focusing solely on its IT solutions business, Agilysys annual revenues will be approximately $470 million immediately following the divestiture of KSG, with gross margins in excess of 20%.
In the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, Agilysys expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately $2 million. However, Agilysys expects to realize cost savings of approximately $12 million in selling, general and administrative expenses over the following 12 months.
As a solution provider, Agilysys will continue its growth as one of the leading providers of innovative IT solutions to the corporate and public sectors, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality. The company will have sales and service coverage across North America, and in Hong Kong, China and the United Kingdom, as a leading provider of:
Proceeds from the sale of KSG will be used to accelerate growth both organically and through acquisition. Based on today's announcement, the company has established a number of long-term goals:
Rhein added, "Agilysys will have a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility to quickly take advantage of opportunities within the solution provider space that enhance and differentiate its
 
product and services offerings, broaden the customer base and expand its markets, while increasing shareholder value. Our board of directors and management team continue to focus on growing shareholder value, and with today's announcement will again redeploy the asset base to create additional value for shareholders."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On January 2, 2007 Agilysys, Inc.

("Arrow") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Arrow Electronics Canada Ltd. and Support Net, Inc., for $485 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined at close (the "Transaction"). KSG accounted for 73%, or $1.24 billion, of Agilysys consolidated sales for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2006. The Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and Agilysys shareholder approval. Approval of the transaction by shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of Agilysys common shares.
Asset Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement between Agilysys and Arrow entered into in connection with the Transaction, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Agilysys has agreed to sell the operations and assets of KSG to Arrow for $485 in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined at close and certain closing conditions including regulatory and Agilysys shareholder approval.
If the Transaction is terminated because Agilysys shareholders fail to approve the Transaction, Agilysys will reimburse Arrow for the expenses Arrow incurred in connection with the Transaction. If Agilysys receives an offer to acquire the assets and operations of KSG and the Transaction later is terminated because of breach by Agilysys or the failure of Agilysys shareholders to approve the Transaction, and within one year of termination Agilysys enters into and closes a transaction which constitutes a Superior Offer, as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement, Agilysys will pay Arrow a termination fee equal to two percent of the purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement (less any expenses previously reimbursed to Arrow) within 10 days of the closing of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Offer. If the Agilysys Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation that the Agilysys shareholders approve the Transaction, and the Transaction later is terminated because the Agilysys shareholders fail to approve the Transaction, Agilysys will pay Arrow a termination fee equal to one percent of the purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement (less any expenses previously reimbursed to Arrow).
In the event that Agilysys receives notice or becomes aware of any Pre-Closing Lost Customers, as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement, or if Oracle Corporation ("Oracle")  a supplier to KSG  does not consent to the Transaction, the purchase price will be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount by which the sum of (a) the sales to such Pre-Closing Lost Customers during the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2006 and (b) sales of Oracle products during the twelve month period ending September 30, 2006, exceeds $200 million, multiplied by (y) 0.35.
The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, Agilysys shall have obtained consents of credit facility lenders, the parties shall have executed ancillary agreements relating to the transition of the operations following consummation of the Transaction and the future purchase of products, and the previously obtained consent for the Transaction given by IBM Corporation ("IBM") must not be withdrawn.

Limitations on the abovementioned indemnification by Arrow are described in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed by the contracting parties, including being qualified by disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

Our Strategic Transformation and Background of the Sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business (see pages 19-25)
 
This transaction is a continuation of the company's long-term strategic plan to position Agilysys closer to the end customer and higher up the IT value scale.
 
In February 2003, Agilysys (known then as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc.) embarked on its strategic transformation by divesting its broad-line electronic components distribution business, to focus exclusively on its computer systems business. Over the subsequent four years, the company completed a name change to Agilysys and acquired five privately held companies, expanding its IT Solutions Business and establishing reach into the growing retail and hospitality markets.
 
During this time, Agilysys significantly improved its balance sheet. Working capital requirements were meaningfully reduced by divesting the electronic components distribution business, leading to reduced cash requirements to fund growth and, as a result, increased cash levels. The company significantly reduced its debt during this period, too. Since the beginning of fiscal 2003, the company has retired $150 million of 9.5% Senior Notes and $143 million of 6.75% Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred securities. With the remaining portion of this long-term debt retired in August 2006, the company became debt-free for the first time in more than 30 years.
 
Reasons for the Sale Of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business (see page 26-28)
 
Our executive management team and board of directors believe the sale of KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and the terms of the related asset purchase agreement are in the best interests of Agilysys and our shareholders. The reasons for the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will complete the company's strategic transformation and will provide the following anticipated benefits:

Principal Risks and Disadvantages of the Transaction (see pages 27-28)
 
Our board of directors also considered various risks when evaluating the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business which include, among others, that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Net Proceeds From The Asset Sale (see pages 33-34)
 
The net proceeds will vary based on final transaction expenses, taxes payable on the gain on sale, and the net working capital calculation on the closing date. The $485 million purchase price is based on working capital levels as of September 30, 2006. If the asset sale had closed on such date, no working capital adjustment would have been needed. Because this is a sale of assets, the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the net tax value of assets of the sold assets and liabilities is subject to federal and state income taxes. We estimate the federal and state income taxes related to the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to be approximately $145 million. Estimated after-tax proceeds will be approximately $340 million before any application of the post-closing net working capital adjustment.
 
Use of Net Proceeds From The Asset Sale; Operations After the Asset Sale (see pages 33-38)
 
The company plans to use the proceeds over the short and medium term for: (i) the return of cash to shareholders through a self-tender offer, (ii) investment in the growth of the IT Solutions Business, both organically and through acquisition, and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The repurchase of the shares is a significant short-term use of proceeds to be executed soon after the close of the transaction. Use of the proceeds for investment in the business will be ongoing over the short to medium term both as new headcount is added and new products and services are developed. Acquisitions will be continually pursued and proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions.

Our Operations Following the Sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business (see pages 35 - 38)
 
Completion of this transaction will now enable the company to focus solely on growing its established IT Solutions Business. This will allow Agilysys to continue its growth as a leading provider of innovative IT solutions to corporate and public sector customers, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality.
 
Agreements Related to the Asset Purchase Agreement (see page 57).
 
In connection with the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, we and Buyers have agreed to enter into a product procurement agreement and a transition services agreement. Pursuant to the product procurement agreement we will purchase certain products exclusively from Arrow. Pursuant to the transition services agreement we will provide certain transition services to Buyers and Buyers will provide services to us.
 
Buyers' Announced Reasons for the Purchase of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business (see page 28)
 
Buyers expect the purchase of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to significantly benefit its existing enterprise computing distribution business. In particular, Buyers have announced the following reasons for the purchase of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business:

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the Board of Directors of Agilysys (see pages 29 - 33)
 
JPMorgan Securities, Inc., or JPMorgan, has delivered a written opinion to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Agilysys and Agilysys Canada of the consideration to be received by Agilysys and Agilysys Canada in the proposed sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. JPMorgan's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of ours as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business or any other matter, and should not be relied upon by any shareholder as such.
 
The full text of the written opinion of JPMorgan, dated January 2, 2007, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations of the review undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The summary of JPMorgan's opinion included in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. We urge our shareholders to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.
 
No Changes to the Rights of Security Holders (see page 39)
 
There will be no change in the rights of our shareholders as a result of the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal (see pages 39 - 40)
 
Under Ohio law, if you do not vote for the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and you comply with the statutory requirements of the Ohio Revised Code ("ORC"), you may elect to receive the fair cash value of your shares. Fair cash value: (i) will be determined as of the day prior to the special meeting, (ii) will be the amount a willing seller and willing buyer would accept or pay with neither being under compulsion to sell or buy, (iii) will not exceed the amount specified in the shareholder's written demand, and (iv) will exclude any appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from anticipation of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
To perfect your right to appraisal, you must:
 
 
Agilysys will not notify shareholders of the expiration of this period. Agilysys shareholders who desire to demand their dissenters' rights but fail to perfect or who effectively withdraw or lose the right to appraisal prior to the effective time of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will remain shareholders of Agilysys and will not be entitled to the fair cash value of their shares. A copy of Section 1701.85 of the ORC is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

Regulatory Matters (see page 41)
 
 
Accounting Treatment (see page 41)
 
The proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is expected to be accounted for as a sale of assets transaction, pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At the closing of the proposed asset sale, any excess in the purchase price received by us, less transaction expenses, over the book value of the net assets sold will be recognized as a gain for financial accounting purposes. In subsequent reporting periods, the presentation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for current and prior years, including the gain on sale of its assets, will be presented as a discontinued operation for financial accounting purposes.
 
Voting by Our Directors and Executive Officers (see page 41)
 
As of December 1, 2006, Agilysys directors and executive officers owned of record 532,830 common shares representing approximately 1.7% of the outstanding votes of all of our common shares. We believe that each of our directors and executive officers will vote "FOR" all of the proposals that shareholders are being asked to approve.

Effects of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
 
Shares voted as abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting and treated as unvoted, although present and entitled to vote, for purposes of determining the approval of the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and the proposal to authorize adjournment or postponement. As a result, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. Brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals. Therefore, if a broker submits a proxy that indicates that the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner as to certain common shares, those common shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting, and these "broker non-votes" will have the same effect as votes against the proposal to approve the proposed asset sale. "Broker non-votes" will not affect the proposal to authorize adjournment or postponement.
 
Cost of Solicitation
 
We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this proxy statement, the proxy and any additional information furnished to you. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names our common shares beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of common shares for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees. The company has retained Georgeson Inc. to assist in soliciting proxies, at an anticipated cost of $25,000 plus expenses.

Our Strategic Transformation and Background of the Sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
 
Business and Industry Overview
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, Agilysys (known then as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc.) had managed through a difficult year. Sales had declined 20% from $2.9 billion in fiscal 2001 to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2002. Gross margins were pressured, significantly declining for the second year in a row, and operating margins were at an all-time low at just under 1%. The distribution-focused business was capital intensive, requiring an inventory investment of over $260 million, and long-term debt levels were over $300 million, equating to a ratio of approximately 50%. The company had limited financial flexibility and even with aggressive management of expenses, the company reported break-even operating results, and a net loss in earnings per share.
debt-to-capital
 
Fiscal 2003 looked to be another challenging year with a protracted downturn in electronics markets and continued competitive pressures on margins and pricing.
 
Specifically, the electronic components business was challenged by a number of issues, including:
 
 
On the other hand, the computer industry provided more significant long-term growth opportunities for the company than the electronic components industry. In addition, the operating margins of 3% to 5% achieved by the company's computer systems business were among the best in the industry. The prospects for further growth in the computer systems business were excellent, as forecasts at the time called for IT spending growth from 2001 through 2006 at a compound annual growth rate of 8% to 10% worldwide. Agilysys had significant opportunities to grow the
Table of Contents
computer systems business both organically and through acquisitions to expand its product and service offerings and profit potential.
 
Beginning of the Transformation
 
Working with Stern Stewart & Co. (financial advisors and experts in the development of EVA or Economic Value Added, the business performance and valuation measure), Agilysys conducted a review of strategic alternatives for the company. From that process, a strategic plan to transform the business was developed to increase the intrinsic value of the company, which would, in turn, increase shareholder value.
 
The company's strategic transformation began with its divestiture of its broad-line electronic components distribution business to focus solely on the computer systems business. The sale of the electronic components business meant that the company would be less dependent on the more cyclical markets in the components business. In addition, the company would be able to invest more in the computer systems business, which offered greater potential for sustainable growth at higher levels of profitability.
 
The proceeds from the sale of the electronic components distribution business, combined with cash generated from the company's ongoing operations, were used to retire long-term debt and accelerate the growth of the company, both organically and through a series of acquisitions.
 
Following the sale of the electronic components distribution business, the company announced that it would restructure its remaining computer systems business and facilities to reduce overhead and eliminate assets that were inconsistent with the company's strategic plan. As a result of the restructuring, management adjusted cost and overhead appropriately to deal with the immediately reduced sales and profitability. The remaining computer systems business consisted of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and the IT Solutions Business. The KeyLink Systems Distribution Business operated as a distributor of enterprise computing products and sold to resellers, who then sold directly to end customers. The IT Solutions Business operated as a reseller providing enterprise servers, software, storage and services and sold directly to end customers. Overall, the company was a leading distributor and reseller of enterprise computer systems, software, storage and services from HP, IBM, Intel, Enterasys, Hitachi Data Systems, Oracle and other leading manufacturers.

The computer systems business enjoyed a strong market position in a more stable industry with significant growth opportunities. Management had identified its top priorities for the company as long-term growth, innovation and differentiation  all directed toward achieving growth at more sustainable, higher levels of profitability and improved shareholder returns.
 
Goals and Accomplishments
 
With the divestiture of its $1.0 billion electronic components distribution business, the company sold 43% of its annual sales of $2.3 billion, with the intent to significantly grow the remaining business and improve profits within two to three years. At that time, management developed a number of near and longer-term goals, all of which the company essentially met or exceeded ahead of schedule.
 
From fiscal 2004 to 2006, these included:

point-of-sale,
 
The acquisition of Visual One strategically provides Agilysys a complementary product offering and significantly increases the breadth of its customer set in the hospitality market. The purchase also immediately provides Agilysys a Windows-based solution for hotels and resorts that expands its current leading position in the hotel casino and destination resort market.
 
During this time-line period, Agilysys reduced its working capital as a percentage of revenue, provided greater rewardable value by positioning the company closer to the end customer, improved its margins and cash flow, and significantly delevered its balance sheet. The company also made five strategic acquisitions which expanded its product and service offerings, increased the profitably and extended its reach into new geographies and markets, and contributed to the acquisition and development of intellectual assets.
Table of Contents
In addition to the favorable financial impact of these acquisitions, the company has significantly reduced leverage and in the process retired $150 million of 9.5% Senior Notes and $143 million of 6.75% Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred securities. With the remaining portion of this long-term debt retired in August 2006, the company became debt-free for the first time in more than 30 years. The strengthening of the balance sheet together with the business transformation has allowed us to reposition our company so that we have the flexibility to competitively build our IT Solutions Business.
 
From a stock price of $8.93 prior to the electronic components distribution business divestiture announcement in January 2003 to the closing price of $16.74 at December 31, 2006, the stock has increased $7.81, or 87%. In the process, Agilysys has grown sales from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2003 to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006.
 
Completing the Transformation
 
The management team has proven that it can successfully redeploy the asset base and seize marketplace opportunities to shape a more profitable and attractive business after a significant divestiture. It intends to do the same with the timely strategic divestiture of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
The sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is the final event that completes this multi-year transformation to move Agilysys closer to the customer and higher up the IT value scale, effectively positioning it to focus on its higher-growth IT Solutions Business. As a result of the divestiture, the company will essentially be freed from the increasing channel conflict and marketplace restrictions that exist in the business today.
 
This is the foundation upon which Agilysys intends to continue to grow following the divestiture of KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. We expect that the IT Solutions Business will:
 
 
Background of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
 
During calendar year 2004, our board of directors engaged JPMorgan to assist in a strategic review of our evolving business, particularly evaluating relative opportunities and challenges in our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and our expanding IT Solutions Business. As a result of this review, our board of directors determined that divesting our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business would present an opportunity to maximize the value of that business while affording us a significant opportunity to increase long-term shareholder value.
 
To confirm our board's strategic and value expectations, the company was assisted by JPMorgan in conducting a confidential process to allow qualified, interested potential acquirers to evaluate the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and submit competitive offers. The company also continued its ongoing discussions with several potential IT Solutions Business target acquisition candidates to confirm growth, profitability and scale opportunities in that business.
 
JPMorgan conducted an auction process in late 2004 and early 2005, inviting a number of strategic and private equity investors to sign confidentiality agreements and obtain summary financial and descriptive information regarding the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. After providing preliminary indications of interest, a small number of participants were invited to review detailed financial and other business information, as well as to meet with management. Final bids and completed contract proposals were received from two parties, including Arrow, in March 2005. IBM was unable to resolve matters related to the IBM franchise agreement and, therefore, the parties terminated further discussion regarding the transaction.
Table of Contents
In the months immediately following the unsuccessful divestiture process, we continued to engage JPMorgan to evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. In late 2005, certain changes in the computer enterprise distribution market led both Agilysys and Arrow to believe that a transaction may be possible and would be mutually beneficial to both companies.
 
On December 2, 2005, Mr. Arthur Rhein, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, contacted Mr. William E. Mitchell, Arrow's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, for the purpose of exploring Arrow's interest in acquiring the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. On January 13, 2006, at the request of Mr. Rhein, Mr. Mitchell met with Mr. Rhein. Mr. Rhein and Mr. Mitchell discussed Arrow's interest in re-engaging in discussions to acquire the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. It was agreed that a very small group of management at the respective companies would be made aware of the discussions. On January 17, 2006, Mr. Paul J. Reilly, Arrow's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, contacted Mr. Martin F. Ellis, Agilysys Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, with an information request. The information request was filled over the following weeks and months. On May 10, 2006, Mr. Ellis met with Mr. Reilly to discuss progress and a mechanism for addressing outstanding issues. On May 18, 2006, a meeting was held principally between Mr. Ellis and Mr. Reilly, and other representatives of Agilysys and Arrow as well as financial advisors, to discuss valuation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and to present the value of the transaction to Arrow. Mr. Ellis discussed with Mr. Reilly and other representatives of Arrow the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business' business model, expected revenue and profitability growth, possible synergies from the potential transaction, tax benefits to Arrow and the incremental profitability and value to Arrow of establishing a product procurement agreement between Agilysys and Arrow. This discussion was followed by a meeting on May 31, 2006 which included business unit management from the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and Arrow, to discuss in greater detail the revenue and profitability contribution to Arrow of the product procurement agreement.
 
IBM was contacted in the spring of 2006 to explore IBM's willingness to consent to the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to Arrow. Discussions continued with IBM.
 
Renewed discussions, due diligence and negotiation of an asset purchase agreement and product procurement agreement between Agilysys and Arrow took place over the first half of 2006.
 
In the fall of 2006, IBM indicated its willingness to consider consenting to the sale of the business to Arrow.
 
In October 2006, Arrow engaged in further due diligence. On November 8, 2006, Arrow submitted an information request for due diligence. On December 5, 2006, a management meeting was held between Agilysys and Arrow. In late December 2006, IBM provided its consent for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to be sold to Arrow only. Due diligence and negotiations of the terms and conditions of the asset purchase agreement and the product procurement agreement continued through the end of the calendar year 2006.
 
Throughout the process, from late 2004 through announcement of the transaction, the board of directors received regular updates on status of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business as well as explored other strategic alternatives to separate the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business from the IT Solutions Business. A special meeting of the board of directors was held on December 20, 2006 to review and discuss the progress, status and possible terms of a potential sale of the business to Arrow. Management and the company's legal advisors reviewed the material terms of the draft asset purchase agreement, draft procurement agreement, and draft proxy statement. JPMorgan reviewed with the board the valuation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, implications of alternative purchase prices on a fairness opinion and a variety of alternatives regarding use of proceeds, including issuer tender offer considerations.
 
Agilysys and Arrow negotiated terms and conditions on the asset purchase agreement and the product procurement agreement and on December 31, 2006, had come to agreement on all material terms and conditions. On January 2, 2007, the board of directors held a special telephonic meeting to review the final terms and conditions of the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. Management and the company's legal advisors reviewed the material terms of the asset purchase agreement, product procurement agreement, and draft proxy statement, specifically noting the changes since the Special Board Meeting on December 20, 2006. JPMorgan again reviewed with the board the valuation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and provided its oral fairness opinion. The board also reviewed tender offer considerations among other use of proceeds alternatives.

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the Board of Directors of Agilysys
 
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated November 5, 2004, as amended October 30, 2006, we retained JPMorgan as our financial advisor in connection with the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
At a meeting of our board of directors held on January 2, 2007, JPMorgan rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion, to our board of directors that, as of that date and based upon the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by Agilysys and Agilysys Canada in the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business was fair, from a financial point of view, to Agilysys and Agilysys Canada.
 
The full text of the written opinion of JPMorgan, dated January 2, 2007, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations of the review undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The summary of JPMorgan's opinion included in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. We urge our shareholders to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. JPMorgan provided its opinion to our board of directors in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. JPMorgan's opinion addresses only the consideration to be received in the sale, which was determined in negotiations between us and Arrow, and does not address any other matter. JPMorgan's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of ours as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business or any other matter, and should not be relied upon by any shareholder as such.
 
In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:
 
 
In addition, JPMorgan held discussions with certain members of our and Arrow's management with respect to certain aspects of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, and the past and current business operations of Agilysys and the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Agilysys and the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, and certain other matters JPMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
 
In giving its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed, without assuming responsibility or liability for independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with it by us or otherwise reviewed by or for JPMorgan. JPMorgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did JPMorgan evaluate the solvency of

our company, Agilysys Canada, Arrow, Arrow Canada or Support Net, Inc. under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to it, JPMorgan assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by our management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to which such analyses or forecasts relate. JPMorgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. JPMorgan also assumed that the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and the other transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement will be consummated as described in the asset purchase agreement. JPMorgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by us, Agilysys Canada, Arrow, Arrow Canada and Support Net, Inc. in the asset purchase agreement and related agreements were and will be true and correct in all ways material to JPMorgan's analysis, and that we will have no exposure under any indemnification obligations contained within the asset purchase agreement or the related documents in any amount material to its analysis, and that the purchase price adjustments set forth in the asset purchase agreement will not result in any adjustment to the consideration that is material to JPMorgan's analysis. JPMorgan is not legal, regulatory or tax experts, and relied on the assessments made by our advisors with respect to such issues. JPMorgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will be obtained without any adverse effect on us.
 
JPMorgan's opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan as of, the date of the opinion. Subsequent developments may affect JPMorgan's opinion and JPMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. JPMorgan's opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by Agilysys and Agilysys Canada in the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and JPMorgan expresses no opinion as to the fairness of the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of ours or as to the underlying decision by Agilysys and Agilysys Canada to engage in the transaction. JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which our common stock will trade at any future time.
 
Summary of JPMorgan's Analysis
 
In connection with its opinion, JPMorgan performed the following financial analyses:
 
 
For the comparable company trading multiples analysis and precedent transaction multiples analysis, JPMorgan used summary financial estimates prepared by our management, which we refer to as the management projections, public filings, press releases, market data, and equity research reports. The discounted cash flow analysis was prepared using two cases based on our management's projections. All market data used by JPMorgan in its analyses was as of the close of trading on December 29, 2006.
 
The following paragraphs summarize but do not purport to be complete descriptions of the analyses JPMorgan performed. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and does not lend itself to partial analysis or summary descriptions. Accordingly, the following summary of the analyses performed by JPMorgan must be considered in its entirety, as selecting portions of the analyses performed by JPMorgan could create an incomplete view of the process or assumptions underlying JPMorgan's analyses and opinion. In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan considered all of the financial analyses that it performed and did not attribute any particular weight to any individual analysis or factor that it considered or reach any specific conclusion with respect to any individual analysis. Rather, JPMorgan made its determination as to the fairness to Agilysys and Agilysys Canada, from a financial point of view, on the basis of JPMorgan's experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses performed by it. Analyses that are based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, the forecasts and analyses made or used by JPMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future
Table of Contents
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, JPMorgan's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be bought or sold.
 
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses that JPMorgan used in providing its opinion.
 
Comparable Company Trading Multiples Analysis
 
Using publicly available information, JPMorgan examined the trading values of selected companies involved in enterprise computer products and services distribution that it deemed to be comparable in operations to the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. JPMorgan calculated a range of implied value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business based on the ratio of firm value to estimated calendar year 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, and the ratio of firm value to estimated calendar year 2007 revenues. JPMorgan calculated the firm value of each of those companies by first adding the sum of the company's long-term and short-term debt to the sum of the market value of such company's common equity, the book value of such company's preferred stock and the book value of such company's minority interest, and then subtracting from that result such company's cash and cash equivalents. JPMorgan also calculated the ratio of firm value to EBITDA and ratio of firm value to revenues for Agilysys. For the comparable companies and our company, estimated EBITDA and revenues were based on consensus equity research estimates.
 
JPMorgan determined that the following companies were relevant to an evaluation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business based on JPMorgan's view of the comparability of the operating and financial characteristics of these companies to the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business:
 
 
JPMorgan calculated a range of implied value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business by applying ranges of multiples derived from this analysis to the management projections of estimated 2007 revenues and estimated 2007 EBITDA. A range of multiples of 0.20x to 0.25x was applied to the estimated 2007 revenue projections and a range of multiples of 5.0x to 6.5x was applied to the estimated 2007 EBITDA projections. This analysis indicated approximate firm values for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business ranging from $300 million to $375 million based on estimated 2007 revenues and $400 million to $520 million based on estimated 2007 EBITDA. The $485 million purchase price was greater than the range of approximations of firm value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business based on the multiples for estimated 2007 revenue for us and was within the range based on the multiples for estimated 2007 EBITDA. JPMorgan also noted that the company expects to receive estimated after-tax proceeds of $340 million, although since the comparable companies trading multiples analysis does not take into account the tax consequences of the sale to Agilysys, the estimated after-tax proceeds of $340 million are not directly comparable to the approximate firm values noted above.
Table of Contents
Precedent Transaction Multiples Analysis
 
Using publicly available information, JPMorgan examined the following selected transactions involving companies in the enterprise computer products and services distribution industry.
 
 
JPMorgan calculated the transaction value in the selected transactions as multiples of Latest Twelve Month ("LTM") revenues and LTM EBITDA based on public filings, press releases and equity research reports. As none of these acquisition targets were publicly traded companies at the time of the acquisition, the transaction value used by JPMorgan in its analysis was the announced purchase price, where publicly available. JPMorgan noted that the merger and acquisition transaction environment varies over time. JPMorgan also noted that no transaction reviewed by JPMorgan was directly comparable to the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and that, accordingly, its analysis involved complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business relative to the targets in the selected transactions and other factors that would affect the acquisition values in the precedent transactions.
 
JPMorgan determined that the ratio of the firm value to the LTM revenues and the ratio of the firm value to the LTM EBITDA for the target companies ranged from 0.20x to 0.25x for estimated 2006 revenues and 4.5x to 6.0x for estimated 2006 EBITDA. These multiples indicated approximate firm values for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business ranging from $290 million to $360 million based on estimated 2006 revenue and $340 million to $450 million based on estimated 2006 EBITDA. The $485 million purchase price was greater than the range of approximations of firm value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business based on the multiples for LTM revenues and based on the multiples of LTM EBITDA. JPMorgan also noted that the company expects to receive estimated after-tax proceeds of $340 million, although since the precedent transaction multiples analysis does not take into account the tax consequences of the sale to Agilysys, the estimated after-tax proceeds of $340 million are not directly comparable to the approximate firm values noted above.
 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 
JPMorgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate a range of implied value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their "present value." "Present value" refers to the current value of one or more future cash payments from the asset, which we refer to as that asset's cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, and the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. "Terminal value" refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an asset for periods beyond the final forecast period.
 
JPMorgan performed its discounted cash flow analysis using two cases based on our management's projections using March 31, 2007 as the valuation date. The second case, which we refer to as the sensitivity case, incorporated certain adjustments to our management's projections to incorporate certain risks that could potentially adversely impact the future operations and business performance of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. The projections for both cases consisted of detailed financial projections for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 and extensions of those projections for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Using discount rates ranging from 14.0% to 16.0%, JPMorgan calculated a range of present values for the future unlevered free cash flows that the KeyLink
Table of Contents
Systems Distribution Business is expected to generate, based upon both cases. The discount rates utilized were chosen based upon an analysis of the cost of capital for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. The terminal value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business was calculated using perpetuity growth rates ranging from negative 1.5% to positive 1.5%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated approximate firm values for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business ranging from $355 million to $430 million based on management's projections and $265 million to $320 million based on the sensitivity case. The $485 million purchase price was greater than the range of approximations of firm value for the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business based on both cases. Since a discounted cash flow analysis measures after-tax value, JPMorgan also compared the estimated after-tax proceeds of approximately $340 million to the range of firm values calculated and found that the estimated after tax proceeds were less than the approximations of firm value for the management projections and greater than the approximations of firm value for the sensitivity case.
 
JPMorgan's opinion was one of many factors that our board of directors considered in making its determination to recommend that our shareholders approve the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. You should not view the analyses of JPMorgan as a determination of the opinion of our board of directors with respect to our value.
 
Our board of directors selected JPMorgan to render its opinion in connection with the sale of our Keylink Systems Distribution Business because of JPMorgan's reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the sale of our Keylink Systems Distribution Business and because JPMorgan is familiar with us and our business. Our board of directors did not limit the investigations made or the procedures followed by JPMorgan in giving its oral or written opinion.
 
JPMorgan will receive a fee of $9,700,000 from us for its services as our financial advisor, a portion of which was paid upon delivery of its fairness opinion and a substantial portion of which it will receive upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify JPMorgan and its affiliates from and against certain liabilities arising from its engagement as our financial advisor, including liabilities under securities laws, and, subject to limited exceptions, to reimburse JPMorgan and its affiliates for all reasonable expenses incurred by them in investigating, preparing or defending any action or proceeding arising out of its provision of services as our financial advisor. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse JPMorgan for its reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with its provision of services to us, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors. JPMorgan and its affiliates have performed in the past, and may continue to perform, certain services for us, Arrow and our and Arrow's respective affiliates, all for customary compensation, including acting as co-managing underwriter of an offering of common stock of Arrow in 2004. JPMorgan's commercial bank affiliate is a lender to us and is agent bank on Arrow's credit facility. In the ordinary course of its businesses, JPMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade our and Arrow's debt and equity securities for its own account or for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, it may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities.
 
Proceeds From the Sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
 
With all remaining portions of long-term debt retired in August 2006, Agilysys became debt-free for the first time in more than 30 years. As of September 30, 2006, the company had $95.7 million in cash on hand. With operating cash flows and the net proceeds from the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, the company expects to have approximately $440 million in cash on hand at close.
 
The company plans to use the net proceeds over the short and medium term for: (i) the return of cash to shareholders through a self-tender offer, (ii) investment in the growth of the IT Solutions Business, both organically and through acquisition, and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The repurchase of the shares is a significant short-term use of proceeds to be executed as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the transaction. Use of the proceeds for investment in the business will be ongoing over the short to medium term both as new headcount is added and new products and services are developed. Acquisitions will be continually pursued and proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions.

Growth Opportunities and Strategy
 
By taking advantage of its market opportunities for growth via acquisitions and organically, the company intends to more fully leverage its industry-recognized operational savvy and customer service excellence, coupled with its demonstrated financial discipline, to deliver on the following newly projected performance goals:
 
 
Market Opportunities
 
Within the IT industry in which Agilysys operates, product sets include enterprise servers, data storage hardware, systems infrastructure software, networking equipment and IT services related to the implementation and support of these systems. IDC and other researchers estimate North American spending in these product sets was $211 billion in 2005, and is projected to grow to $272 billion by 2010.
 
The IT Solutions Business, with $470 million in revenues, is currently among the largest solution providers in the industry. From fiscal 2003 to 2006, the sales of IT solutions to end users increased from $276.7 million to $470 million or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%, which includes acquisitions. The CAGR for the solutions segment of the IT industry was approximately 6% from 2003 to 2006 (Source: IDC).
 
Organic Growth
 
With its current financial flexibility and strong balance sheet, combined with the proceeds of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, the company has the means to continue investing in the business through organic growth as well as through acquisitions. Agilysys plans to continue enhancing its offerings organically through the development of products and services that will further differentiate its competitive position. The company's ongoing goal will be to develop intellectual assets in the form of products and services that are higher up the value scale, and for which Agilysys will be financially rewarded.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Agilysys continues to broaden its offering through the acquisition of products and services that help provide a differentiated competitive position. The company evaluates any prospective acquisition based on its potential to accelerate growth by expanding the Agilysys customer base, extending its reach into new markets, expanding its offering of proprietary services to select industry vertical markets, or broadening the range of solutions that the company offers. Agilysys requires any acquisition to improve the company's financial performance within a reasonable period of time and create value for shareholders. Management is confident in its ability to identify and purchase established, high-quality companies at an acceptable price and to effectively integrate them with minimal risk.
 
Both organic growth and additional acquisitions are expected to contribute significantly to the company's achievement of its stated goals of revenue growth, improved gross margins and greater return on capital over the next three years. Following the divestiture, Agilysys will have a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility to quickly take advantage of its opportunities to enhance and differentiate its product and services offerings, broaden the customer base and expand its markets, while increasing shareholder value. As demonstrated by the company's successful track record and strategic transformation over the past four years, the board of directors and management team will continue to focus on growing shareholder value by again redeploying the asset base to deliver additional sustainable value to shareholders.

Shareholder Approval of the Sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
 
We are organized under the corporate laws of the State of Ohio. Under Section 1701.76 of the ORC, the sale by us of "all or substantially all" our assets requires approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding common shares on the record date. The Ohio statute does not define the phrase "all or substantially all" and, since we are retaining material on-going businesses and assets after the proposed asset sale, the meaning of the phrase is not entirely clear in this context. In light of this uncertainty, we are seeking approval of our shareholders of the proposed asset sale. The asset purchase agreement provides that if our shareholders fail to approve the proposed asset sale, either party may terminate the asset purchase agreement. The asset purchase agreement also provides that obtaining such approval is a condition to each of us and Buyers being obligated to consummate the asset sale.
 
No Changes to the Rights of Security Holders
 
Our shareholders will not experience any change in their rights as shareholders as a result of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal
 
Under Ohio law, if you do not vote for the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and comply with the other statutory requirements of the ORC, you may elect to receive the fair cash value of your shares. Fair cash value: (i) will be determined as of the day prior to the special meeting, (ii) will be the amount a willing seller and willing buyer would accept or pay with neither being under compulsion to sell or buy, (iii) will not exceed the amount specified in the shareholder's written demand, and (iv) will exclude any appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from anticipation of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
The following is a description of the steps you must take to perfect your dissenters' rights under Ohio law. This summary does not purport to contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read carefully the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the ORC, which is reproduced in full as Annex C to this proxy statement.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
To exercise your dissenters' rights, strict adherence to the provisions of Ohio law is required. If you think you may desire to exercise your dissenters' rights, you should carefully review the statutory provisions attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. As in all legal matters, you would be well advised to seek the guidance of your personal attorney.
 
Agilysys shareholders who desire to demand their dissenters' rights but fail to perfect or who effectively withdraw or lose the right to appraisal prior to the effective time of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will remain shareholders of Agilysys and will not be entitled to the fair cash value of their shares.
 
If you fail to comply strictly with the procedures described above, you will lose your appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, we strongly urge you to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your appraisal rights.

Regulatory Matters
 
The asset sale is subject to review by the United States Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act. Under the HSR Act, Agilysys and Buyers are required to make pre-acquisition notification filings and to await the expiration or early termination of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the acquisition. These filings were made on January , 2007.
[  ]
 
Even after the expiration of the statutory waiting period and completion of the acquisition, either the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission could challenge, seek to block or block the acquisition under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the acquisition, before or after it is completed. We cannot be sure that a challenge to the acquisition will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, that we and Buyers will prevail.
 
Other than applicable U.S. antitrust laws, compliance with the applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this proxy statement and compliance with the ORC in connection with the proposed asset sale, neither we nor Buyers are aware of any other regulatory requirements or governmental approvals or actions that may be required to consummate the sale. Should any such approval or action be required, it is presently contemplated that such approval or action would be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any such approval or action, if needed, could be obtained and would not be conditioned in a manner that would cause the parties to abandon the acquisition.
 
Accounting Treatment
 
The proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is expected to be accounted for as a sale of assets transaction, pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At the closing of the proposed asset sale, any excess in the purchase price received by the company, less transaction expenses, over the book value of the net assets sold will be recognized as a gain for financial accounting purposes. In subsequent reporting periods, the presentation of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for current and prior years, including the gain on sale of its assets, will be presented as a discontinued operation for financial accounting purposes.
 
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
 
The proposed asset sale will be a transaction taxable to us for United States consolidated federal income tax purposes. We will recognize taxable income equal to the amount realized on the sale in excess of our tax basis in the assets sold. The amount realized on the sale will consist of the cash received in exchange for the assets sold, plus the amount of liabilities assumed by Buyers. We estimate that the federal and state income taxes related to the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to be approximately $145 million. The federal income tax portion of the total tax liability will be approximately $130 million.
 
Although the asset sale will result in a taxable gain to us, a portion of the taxable gain will be offset to the extent of available net operating loss carry forwards as currently reflected on our state income tax returns. The taxable gain will differ from the gain to be reported in our financial statements due to temporary tax differences and certain other differences between the tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Our shareholders will experience no federal income tax consequences as a result of the consummation of the proposed sale of the assets to Buyers pursuant to the asset purchase agreement. If we engage in a self-tender offer following the closing, any tax consequences to you as a result of the self-tender offer will be described in the applicable self-tender offer documents that will be sent to shareholders describing the self-tender offer.
 
Voting By Our Directors and Executive Officers
 
As of December 1, 2006, Agilysys directors and executive officers owned of record 532,830 common shares representing approximately 1.7% of the outstanding votes of all of our common shares. We believe that each of our directors and executive officers intends to vote at the special meeting in favor of all of the proposals that shareholders are being asked to approve.

You should carefully consider the special risk considerations described below as well as other information provided to you or referenced in this document in deciding how to vote on the proposal to sell the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. The special risk considerations described below are not the only ones facing Agilysys. Additional considerations not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following special risk considerations actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
 
Special Risk Considerations Regarding the Proposal to Sell the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
 
If we fail to complete the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, our business may be harmed.
 
We cannot assure you that the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will be completed. As a result of our announcement of the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. New or existing customers may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because customers may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. If we fail to complete the proposed asset sale, the failure to maintain existing business relationships or enter into new ones could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to complete the proposed asset sale, we will retain and continue to operate the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business as well as our IT Solutions Business and our channel conflict with our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business customers will continue. The resultant potential for loss or disaffection of one or more large KeyLink Systems Distribution Business customers would have a material, negative impact on the value of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
You are not guaranteed any of the proceeds from the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
 
The purchase price for the assets of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business will be paid directly to our company. As soon as reasonably practicable following the completion of the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, we intend to purchase up to six million common shares in an estimated $100 million self-tender offer. The ultimate number of shares and dollar value of the self-tender offer will be dependent on the stock price and market conditions at the time. You should be aware that, although we expect to commence the self-tender offer shortly following the closing, it is possible that we will not commence the self-tender offer or the cash payment we expect to offer could be substantially less than we currently anticipate due to unanticipated events or circumstances. If you decide not to tender your shares in the self-tender offer or if the self-tender offer is not commenced due to unanticipated events or circumstances, you will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the assets and you will continue to be a shareholder in our company.
 
Management could spend or invest the net proceeds from the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business in ways with which our shareholders may not agree, including the possible pursuit of alternative market opportunities, including acquisitions.
 
Our management could spend or invest the proceeds from the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business in ways with which our shareholders may not agree. The investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return. Furthermore, the market for our remaining businesses continues to evolve. We may face risks that may be different from the risks associated with such current businesses.
 
The asset purchase agreement may expose Agilysys to contingent liabilities.
 
Under the asset purchase agreement, we agreed to indemnify Buyers for breach or violation of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by us in the asset purchase agreement and for other matters, subject to certain limitations. Significant indemnification claims by Buyers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We will not be obligated to indemnify Buyers for any breach of the representations and
Table of Contents
warranties made by us under the asset purchase agreement until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification for such breach exceeds 1% of the purchase price, or approximately $4.9 million. In the event that claims for indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties made by us under the asset purchase agreement exceed the stated threshold, we may be obligated to indemnify Buyers for any damages or loss resulting from such breach in an amount not to exceed 20% of the purchase price, or approximately $97 million. Claims for indemnification for breach of any covenant, agreement or other matter made by us in the asset purchase agreement, or for any other matter for which we have agreed to indemnify Buyers, are not subject to the limits described above.
 
Agilysys will be unable to compete with the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for five years from the date of the closing.
 
The asset purchase agreement provides that for a period of five years after the closing, Agilysys will not compete, directly or indirectly, with KeyLink Systems Distribution Business or, without the prior written consent of Buyers, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate, control, as a partner, shareholder or otherwise, any person that conducts the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Special Risk Considerations Regarding the Remaining IT Solutions Business Assuming the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is Sold
 
In order to achieve our stated objectives, we need to engage in a substantial acquisition program that will require successful execution and efficient integration of such acquisitions.
 
Following the divestiture of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, our acquisition strategy will be potentially larger in scope and size than our previous acquisition strategy. We cannot assure you that we will successfully manage the challenges of a more aggressive acquisition program. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully and satisfactorily negotiate the terms of the acquisition. Our management may not be able to effectively implement our acquisition program and internal growth strategy simultaneously. Our failure to identify, consummate or integrate suitable acquisitions could lead to a reduced rate of revenue growth, operating income and net earnings in the future. We cannot readily predict the timing, size or success of our future acquisitions.
 
We may not successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions.
 
The integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial and operational challenges. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating management and personnel from these acquired entities with our management and personnel. Failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of IT risks inherent in supporting a changing business.
 
We may not be able to successfully manage the increased scope of our operations or a significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce as we expand. Additionally, growth increases the demands on our management, our internal systems, procedures and controls. We may be unable to successfully implement improvements to our information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner.
 
Initially our profitability will be dependent upon restructuring and executing planned cost savings.
 
The pro forma financial statements included in this proxy statement show significant operating losses for the six month period ended September 30, 2006 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. These pro forma financial statements do not reflect any planned cost savings that we expect to realize from restructuring of our overhead cost structure after the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. If our cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of costs available to be saved are inaccurate, our revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted. We may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies and operating cost reductions expected
Table of Contents
from these efforts, and may experience business disruptions associated with the restructuring and cost reduction activities. These efforts may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits that we expect. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated. If these efforts are not successful, we intend to undertake additional cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges.
 
We will be dependent on a long-term product procurement agreement with Arrow.
 
We have entered into a long term product procurement agreement to purchase a wide variety of products from Arrow. Our success will be dependent on competitive pricing and availability of products on a timely basis.
 
We are highly dependent on key suppliers and supplier program, which would continue if the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is not sold to Arrow.
 
We presently depend on a small number of key suppliers. During fiscal 2006, products purchased from IBM and HP, the company's two largest suppliers, accounted for 71% and 15%, respectively, of the company's sales volume. After the sale is consummated, we expect to continue to have IBM and HP as large suppliers as well. The loss of either of these suppliers or a combination of certain other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, a supplier may terminate the company's right to sell some or all of a supplier's products or change the terms and conditions of the supplier relationship or reduce or discontinue the incentives or programs offered. Any such termination or implementation of such changes could have a material negative impact on the company's results of operations.
 
The market for our products and services is affected by changing technology and if we fail to anticipate and adapt to such changes, our results of operations may suffer.
 
The markets in which the company competes are characterized by technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. The company's future success will depend on its ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards. If the company fails to successfully manage the challenges of rapidly changing technology, the company's results of operations may suffer.
 
Market factors could cause a decline in spending for information technology, adversely affecting our financial results.
 
Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in demand for information technology by end users could materially adversely affect the demand for our products and services. If the markets for our products and services soften, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments.
 
As part of the company's business strategy, the company seeks acquisition prospects that could accelerate the growth of its business by expanding its customer and supplier base, extending its reach into new markets broadening the range of solutions it offers. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management attention from operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly in quarters immediately following the consummation of acquisitions, as we integrate the operations of the acquired businesses into our operations. Once integrated, acquisitions may not perform as expected. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, Buyers have agreed to purchase substantially all the assets, and assume certain liabilities, relating to the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. We will sell these assets for a purchase price of $485 million in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments described below.
 
At the closing, Buyers will deliver to us the purchase price paid in cash.
 
Purchase Price Adjustment
 
A increase or decrease to the purchase price will occur if the closing net working capital is greater than or less than (i) the greater of 11% of revenues of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for the three month period ending on the closing date or $32 million, if the closing date is March 31, 2007, (ii) the greater of 14% of revenues of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for the three month period ending on the closing date or $38 million, if the closing date is April 30, 2007, or (iii) the greater of 11% of revenues of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business for the three month period ending on the closing date or $32 million, if the closing date is May 31, 2007. All revenue amounts will be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Net working capital means the difference in value between current assets contained in the Purchased Assets and the current liabilities included in the Assumed Liabilities. Within 60 days after the closing date, we will prepare and deliver to Buyers a statement containing the net working capital as of the closing date, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in a manner consistent with our historical internal accounting practices and on a basis consistent with the unaudited balance sheet of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. If there are disagreements with the net working capital statement, the asset purchase agreement contains a dispute resolution mechanism under which PricewaterhouseCoopers will resolve the dispute.

The purchase price may also be reduced in the event that KeyLink Systems Distribution Business customer contracts for the purchase of products have terminated after execution but prior to the closing date or, as of the closing date if Oracle has not consented to the transaction. In that event the purchase price will be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount by which the sum of (a) the sales to such pre-closing lost customers during the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2006 and (b) sales of Oracle products during the twelve month period ending September 30, 2006, exceeds $200 million, multiplied by (y) 0.35.

The asset purchase agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the closing:
 
 
If the asset purchase is terminated because our shareholders fail to approve the proposed asset sale, or the proxy statement fails to be cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the shareholders' meeting fails to have occurred within the relevant time period, we will reimburse Buyers for the expenses they incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement.

If our board of directors withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation that our shareholders approve the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution to Buyers, and the proposed sale later is terminated because our shareholders fail to approve it, we will pay Buyers a termination fee equal to 1% of the purchase price under the asset purchase agreement (less any expenses previously reimbursed to Buyers).
 
Publicity
 
The asset purchase agreement provides that unless otherwise required by applicable law or pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, neither we nor Buyers will issue any press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement without the other's prior consent.
 
No Solicitation
 
Except as necessary to verify another proposal to acquire the Key Link Distribution Business as contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, we have agreed that we will not take any action to encourage any offer or inquiry from any person other than the Buyers regarding the sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.

The term of the product procurement agreement is five years and will automatically renew for one-year periods unless sooner terminated by us or Arrow.
 
The board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the sale of substantially all the assets related to the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business under the terms of the asset purchase agreement.

(b) 
 
Reflects the tax effect of the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and pro forma adjustments calculated at the statutory rates of 38.7% for the six months ended September 30, 2006 and 40.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.
(c) 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2006 reflect the following adjustments:
 
Reflects estimated proceeds to be received at the closing of sale of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. The sale price of $485.0 million was reduced by $11.3 million of expenses for estimated transaction-related costs. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income do not reflect the recognition of these expenses as they are non-recurring in nature; however, these expenses will be reflected in the company's historical financial statements when the transaction is consummated. Additionally, there is potential for a working capital adjustment. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, if the net working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target net working capital, as defined in the agreement, then the purchase price will be adjusted upwards in the amount equal to the excess, and if the net working capital balance at the time of closing is less than the target net working capital, as defined in the agreement, then the purchase price will be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the deficiency.
(d) 
 
Reflects the excess of the estimated proceeds identified under (d) over the following:
(e) 
 
(i) The net book value of KeyLink Systems Distribution Business net assets sold of $43.6 million.
 
(ii) Estimated taxes of $142.8 million.
 
Reflects the anticipated $2.0 million restructuring charge and $109.3 million asset impairment charge for the write-off of goodwill, both directly related to the proposed sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, which will be reflected in the company's historical financial statements when the transaction is consummated to determine the gain on sale of net assets of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.

Agilysys, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Agilysys") distributes and resells a broad range of enterprise computer systems products, including servers, storage, software and services. These products are sold to resellers and commercial end-users. Agilysys has operations in North America and strategic investments in the United States and Europe.
 
On January 2, 2007, Agilysys announced that it signed a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its KeyLink Systems distribution business (the "Business") to Arrow Electronics, Inc. ("Arrow") for $485 million in cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities of the Business (the "Transaction"). The Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and Agilysys shareholder approval. Agilysys has also entered into a long-term product procurement agreement with Arrow to purchase products it had previously purchased directly from suppliers. These include many of the products and services from suppliers such as BEA, EMC, HP, IBM and Oracle that Agilysys uses in providing solutions to end-user customers. As a result of the agreement, Agilysys will become one of Arrow's largest customers and will continue to have a close relationship with the Business.
 
The Business is a leading distributor of enterprise computer systems, selling to more than 800 reseller partners in North America. The Business has significant distribution agreements and relationships with key enterprise vendors including HP, IBM and Oracle.
 
Agilysys has prepared these unaudited financial statements to present the assets and liabilities of the Business included in the Transaction as of September 20, 2006, March 31, 2006 and 2005 as well as the operating results and cash flows of the Business for the six-month period ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005. In preparation of the statements of operations, revenues and expenses directly relating to the Business were included as well as an allocation of indirect overhead costs. Indirect overhead costs have been allocated based on number of employees, facility usage and other applicable factors in estimating the proportion of indirect expenses to allocate to the Business. Management believes that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis and approximate the incremental costs it would have incurred had the Business been operating on a stand alone basis. However, there has been no independent study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the actual direct-costs of obtaining such services would have been. The statements of cash flows have been derived based on analysis of the operating results of the Business and changes in the assets and liabilities included in the Transaction. As the sold assets do not include cash generated from the operating results of the Business, the statements of cash flows include a financing category titled "home office account activity, net" to arrive at a zero change in cash.
 
 
The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following briefly describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements of the Business.
 
  Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Use of estimates.
 
  The Business is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. The Business provides for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on the Business's future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict
Contingencies.
Table of Contents
with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Business.
 
  The Business maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as historic trends of the entire customer pool. If the financial condition of the Business' customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. To mitigate this credit risk, management of the Business performs frequent credit evaluations of its customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.0 million, $2.6 million, and $4.4 million at September 30, 2006, March 31, 2006, and March 31, 2005, respectively.
Allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method on a first-out basis. Inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or market, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation (right of return status), and technological obsolescence, as well as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1.0 million, $1.8 million, and $3.0 million at September 30, 2006, March 31, 2006, and March 31, 2005, respectively.
Inventories.
first-in,
 
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, as are interest costs on capital projects. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized.
Long-lived assets.
 
Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under capital leases, which make up a negligible portion of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements  7 to 30 years; furniture  7 to 10 years; equipment  3 to 10 years; software  3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project's completion.
 
The Business evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.
 
  Accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns, price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs. Amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses, depending on the nature of the program. There is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the Business and confirmation of the claim by our vendors. Historically, estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by vendors.
Valuation of accounts payable.
 
  The Business participates in certain programs provided by various suppliers that enable it to earn volume incentives. These incentives are generally earned by achieving quarterly sales targets. The amounts earned under these programs are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when earned. In addition, the Business receives incentives from suppliers related to cooperative advertising allowances, price protection and other programs. These incentives generally relate to agreements with the suppliers and are recorded, when earned, as a reduction of cost of sales or advertising expense, as appropriate. All costs associated with advertising and promoting products are expensed in the year incurred. Cooperative reimbursements from suppliers, which are earned and available, are recorded in the period the related advertising expenditure is incurred.
Supplier programs.
 
  The Business derives revenue from three primary sources: hardware, software, and services. Revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The
Revenue recognition.
Table of Contents
Business reduces revenue for discounts, sales incentives, estimated customer returns and other allowances. Discounts are offered based on the volume of products and services purchased by customers. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.
 
Regarding hardware sales, revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are not unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement. A majority of hardware sales involve shipment directly from suppliers to the end-user customers. In such transactions, the Business is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and bears credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal with the customer, the Business recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold when it is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized at the point of destination.
 
Regarding software sales, the Business offers remarketed software to its customers. Generally, software sales do not require significant production, modification, or customization at the time of shipment (physically or electronically) to the customer. As such, revenue from software sales is generally recognized when the software has been shipped. For software delivered electronically, delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software.
 
Regarding sales of services, the Business offers third-party services to its customers. In such instances, the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the Business bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer. Since the Business is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions, the Business reports revenue only in the amount of the "commission" (equal to the selling price less the cost of sale) received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale.
 
  The Business' operating results historically have been included in Agilysys consolidated U.S. and state income tax returns. For presentation purposes in the unaudited statements of income, the statutory tax rates for Agilysys were used to estimate the amount of income tax expense of the Business for each of the periods presented. As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, all deferred tax assets and liabilities will remain with Agilysys.
Income taxes.
 
  The carrying amount of the Business' financial instruments, which include accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value.
Fair value of financial instruments.
 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Business to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. Concentration of credit risk on accounts receivable is mitigated by the Business' large number of customers and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. The Business extends credit based on customers' financial condition and generally, collateral is not required. To further reduce credit risk associated with accounts receivable, the Business also performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers.
Concentrations of credit risk.
 
  For the six month ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 as well as the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, the Business' largest two suppliers provided 93% of the Business' sales. The loss of either of the top two suppliers or a combination of certain other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Business' results of operations and financial condition unless alternative products manufactured by others are available to the Business. In addition, although the Business believes that its relationships with suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that the Business' suppliers will continue to supply products on terms acceptable to the Business.
Concentrations of supplier risk.
 
  In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("Statement 157"). Statement 157 provides a single definition of fair value, a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures concerning fair value. Previously, different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures. Statement 157 applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value, except SFAS No. 123R and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value. This pronouncement is effective for the
Recently issued accounting pronouncement.

Business on April 1, 2008. Management does not expect the adoption of Statement 157 to have a material impact on the Business' financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
The Business leases certain office and warehouse facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2016. The following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases, excluding real estate taxes and insurance, which have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of a year as of September 30, 2006:
 
 
Rental expense for all non-cancelable operating leases amounted to $6.7 million, $6.8 million, $13.6 million, and $13.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
 
Employees of the Business meeting certain service requirements participated in profit-sharing and 401(k) plans of Agilysys. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, with Agilysys matching a percentage thereof. Agilysys may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Total profit sharing and matching contributions to the plans for employees of the Business were $0.4 million, $0.3 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Members of the Board of Directors:
 
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") of the consideration to be received by the Company and Agilysys Canada Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (together with the Company, the "Sellers") in the proposed sale (the "Transaction") of the KeyLink Systems business (the "Business") to Arrow Electronics, Inc. ("Arrow"), Arrow Electronics Canada Ltd. ("Arrow Canada") and Support Net, Inc. (collectively with Arrow and Arrow Canada, the "Purchasers") pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement , dated as of January 2, 2007 (the "Agreement"), among the Sellers and the Purchasers. Under the Agreement, the Purchasers will purchase the Purchased Assets (as defined in the Agreement) from the Sellers for cash consideration of $485,000,000 (the "Consideration") and will assume the Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Agreement). We also understand that the Consideration will be subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement based on the amount of the Company's working capital and certain other items as set forth in the Agreement (the "Adjustments").
 
In arriving at our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the Business and the industries in which the Business operates; (iv) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies; (v) compared the financial and operating performance of the Business with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company's common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (vi) reviewed certain internal financial analyses, estimates and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to the Business; and (vii) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and Arrow with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company and the Business, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company and the Business, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
 
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without assuming responsibility or liability for independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Sellers or the Purchasers under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management of the Company as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Business to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Sellers and the Purchasers in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all ways material to our analysis, and that the Company will have no exposure under any
Table of Contents
indemnification obligations contained within the Agreement or the related agreements in any amount material to our analysis, and that the Adjustments will not result in any adjustment to the Consideration that is material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company.
 
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received by the Sellers in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Sellers to engage in the Transaction. We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price at which the Company's common stock will trade at any future time.
 
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
 
We and our affiliates have performed in the past, and may continue to perform, certain services for the Company, Arrow and their respective affiliates, all for customary compensation, including acting as a co-managing underwriter of an offering of common stock of Arrow in 2004. Our commercial bank affiliate is a lender to the Company and is agent bank on Arrow's credit facility.
 
In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of the Company or Arrow for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities.
 
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the consideration to be received by the Sellers in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Sellers.
 
This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.
 
Very truly yours,

Not later than ten days after the date on which the vote on the proposal was taken at the meeting of the shareholders, the dissenting shareholder shall deliver to the corporation a written demand for payment to the dissenting shareholder of the fair cash value of the shares as to which the dissenting shareholder seeks relief, which demand shall state the dissenting shareholder's address, the number and class of such shares, and the amount claimed by the dissenting shareholder as the fair cash value of the shares.
 
(3) The dissenting shareholder entitled to relief under division (C) of section 1701.84 of the Revised Code in the case of a merger pursuant to section 1701.80 of the Revised Code and a dissenting shareholder entitled to relief under division (E) of section 1701.84 of the Revised Code in the case of a merger pursuant to section 1701.801 of the Revised Code shall be a record holder of the shares of the corporation as to which the dissenting shareholder seeks relief as of the date on which the agreement of merger was adopted by the directors of that corporation. Within twenty days after the dissenting shareholder has been sent the notice provided in section 1701.80 or 1701.801 of the Revised Code, the dissenting shareholder shall deliver to the corporation a written demand for payment with the same information as that provided for in division (A)(2) of this section.
 
(4) In the case of a merger or consolidation, a demand served on the constituent corporation involved constitutes service on the surviving or the new entity, whether the demand is served before, on, or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation. In the case of a conversion, a demand served on the converting corporation constitutes service on the converted entity, whether the demand is served before, on, or after the effective date of the conversion.
 
(5) If the corporation sends to the dissenting shareholder, at the address specified in the dissenting shareholder's demand, a request for the certificates representing the shares as to which the dissenting shareholder seeks relief, the dissenting shareholder, within fifteen days from the date of the sending of such request, shall deliver to the corporation the certificates requested so that the corporation may endorse on them a legend to the effect that demand for the fair cash value of such shares has been made. The corporation promptly shall return the endorsed certificates to the dissenting shareholder. A dissenting shareholder's failure to deliver the certificates terminates the dissenting shareholder's rights as a dissenting shareholder, at the option of the corporation, exercised by written notice sent to the dissenting shareholder within twenty days after the lapse of the period, unless a court for good cause shown otherwise directs. If shares represented by a certificate on which such a legend has been endorsed are transferred, each new certificate issued for them shall bear a similar legend, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares. Upon receiving a demand for payment from a dissenting shareholder who is the record holder of uncertificated securities, the corporation shall make an appropriate notation of the demand for payment in its shareholder records. If uncertificated shares for which payment has been demanded are to be transferred, any new certificate issued for the shares shall bear the legend required for certificated securities as provided in this paragraph. A transferee of the shares so endorsed, or of uncertificated securities where such notation has been made, acquires only the rights in the corporation as the original dissenting holder of such shares had immediately after the service of a demand for payment of the fair cash value of the shares. A request under this paragraph by the corporation is not an admission by the corporation that the shareholder is entitled to relief under this section.
fifteen-day
 
(B) Unless the corporation and the dissenting shareholder have come to an agreement on the fair cash value per share of the shares as to which the dissenting shareholder seeks relief, the dissenting shareholder or the corporation, which in case of a merger or consolidation may be the surviving or new entity, or in the case of a
Table of Contents
conversion may be the converted entity, within three months after the service of the demand by the dissenting shareholder, may file a complaint in the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the corporation that issued the shares is located or was located when the proposal was adopted by the shareholders of the corporation, or, if the proposal was not required to be submitted to the shareholders, was approved by the directors. Other dissenting shareholders, within that three-month period, may join as plaintiffs or may be joined as defendants in any such proceeding, and any two or more such proceedings may be consolidated. The complaint shall contain a brief statement of the facts, including the vote and the facts entitling the dissenting shareholder to the relief demanded. No answer to a complaint is required. Upon the filing of a complaint, the court, on motion of the petitioner, shall enter an order fixing a date for a hearing on the complaint and requiring that a copy of the complaint and a notice of the filing and of the date for hearing be given to the respondent or defendant in the manner in which summons is required to be served or substituted service is required to be made in other cases. On the day fixed for the hearing on the complaint or any adjournment of it, the court shall determine from the complaint and from evidence submitted by either party whether the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any shares and, if so, the number and class of such shares. If the court finds that the dissenting shareholder is so entitled, the court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and to recommend a decision on the amount of the fair cash value. The appraisers have power and authority specified in the order of their appointment. The court thereupon shall make a finding as to the fair cash value of a share and shall render judgment against the corporation for the payment of it, with interest at a rate and from a date as the court considers equitable. The costs of the proceeding, including reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable. The proceeding is a special proceeding and final orders in it may be vacated, modified, or reversed on appeal pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code. If, during the pendency of any proceeding instituted under this section, a suit or proceeding is or has been instituted to enjoin or otherwise to prevent the carrying out of the action as to which the shareholder has dissented, the proceeding instituted under this section shall be stayed until the final determination of the other suit or proceeding. Unless any provision in division (D) of this section is applicable, the fair cash value of the shares that is agreed upon by the parties or fixed under this section shall be paid within thirty days after the date of final determination of such value under this division, the effective date of the amendment to the articles, or the consummation of the other action involved, whichever occurs last. Upon the occurrence of the last such event, payment shall be made immediately to a holder of uncertificated securities entitled to payment. In the case of holders of shares represented by certificates, payment shall be made only upon and simultaneously with the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing the shares for which the payment is made.
 
(C) If the proposal was required to be submitted to the shareholders of the corporation, fair cash value as to those shareholders shall be determined as of the day prior to the day on which the vote by the shareholders was taken and, in the case of a merger pursuant to section 1701.80 or 1701.801 of the Revised Code, fair cash value as to shareholders of a constituent subsidiary corporation shall be determined as of the day before the adoption of the agreement of merger by the directors of the particular subsidiary corporation. The fair cash value of a share for the purposes of this section is the amount that a willing seller who is under no compulsion to sell would be willing to accept and that a willing buyer who is under no compulsion to purchase would be willing to pay, but in no event shall the fair cash value of a share exceed the amount specified in the demand of the particular shareholder. In computing fair cash value, any appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from the proposal submitted to the directors or to the shareholders shall be excluded.
 
(D) (1) The right and obligation of a dissenting shareholder to receive fair cash value and to sell such shares as to which the dissenting shareholder seeks relief, and the right and obligation of the corporation to purchase such shares and to pay the fair cash value of them terminates if any of the following applies:
 
(a) The dissenting shareholder has not complied with this section, unless the corporation by its directors waives such failure;
 
(b) The corporation abandons the action involved or is finally enjoined or prevented from carrying it out, or the shareholders rescind their adoption of the action involved;
Table of Contents
(c) The dissenting shareholder withdraws the dissenting shareholder's demand, with the consent of the corporation by its directors;
 
(d) The corporation and the dissenting shareholder have not come to an agreement as to the fair cash value per share, and neither the shareholder nor the corporation has filed or joined in a complaint under division (B) of this section within the period provided in that division.
 
(2) For purposes of division (D)(1) of this section, if the merger, consolidation, or conversion has become effective and the surviving, new, or converted entity is not a corporation, action required to be taken by the directors of the corporation shall be taken by the partners of a surviving, new, or converted partnership or the comparable representatives of any other surviving, new, or converted entity.
 
(E) From the time of the dissenting shareholder's giving of the demand until either the termination of the rights and obligations arising from it or the purchase of the shares by the corporation, all other rights accruing from such shares, including voting and dividend or distribution rights, are suspended. If during the suspension, any dividend or distribution is paid in money upon shares of such class or any dividend, distribution, or interest is paid in money upon any securities issued in extinguishment of or in substitution for such shares, an amount equal to the dividend, distribution, or interest which, except for the suspension, would have been payable upon such shares or securities, shall be paid to the holder of record as a credit upon the fair cash value of the shares. If the right to receive fair cash value is terminated other than by the purchase of the shares by the corporation, all rights of the holder shall be restored and all distributions which, except for the suspension, would have been made shall be made to the holder of record of the shares at the time of termination.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  Feb. 5, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative information technology (IT) solutions, today announced fiscal 2007 unaudited third-quarter and year-to-date results for the periods ended December 31, 2006.
Consolidated sales for the third quarter were $585.0 million, an increase of 10%, compared with sales of $532.2 million for the third quarter last year. The increase was led by double digit growth in industry-standard server and storage hardware; as well as software. Agilysys also reported positive growth in proprietary servers.
Sales of hardware products in the third quarter were $463.9 million, up 10% from $423.2 million in last year's third quarter. Software sales were $96.0 million, up 17% from $81.8 million a year ago. Services sales were $25.0 million, down 8% from $27.2 million in last year's third quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter remained consistent with the third quarter last year at 13.2% of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $44.4 million, or 7.6% of sales, compared with $43.5 million, or 8.2% of sales, for the third quarter last year. Included in the fiscal 2007 third quarter expense is approximately $1.2 million in stock option expense and approximately $0.6 million expense from the company's Asia operations, which were acquired in December 2005.
Third-quarter net income of $20.0 million, or 64 cents per diluted share, increased 32% compared with a net income of $15.2 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter last year.
Arthur Rhein, Agilysys chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "I am very pleased with our performance this quarter, including the impressive results achieved in IT solutions, as this will be our business following the announced divestiture of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. I would also note the results achieved by KeyLink Systems as the organization prepares for its transition to Arrow Electronics."
Update on Divestiture of KeyLink Systems Distribution Business
Agilysys recently announced that it signed a definitive agreement to sell its KeyLink Systems Distribution Business to Arrow Electronics, Inc. for $485 million in cash and to use the proceeds from sale to accelerate the growth of its IT Solutions Business.
The agreement to sell substantially all the assets of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined at close. Taxes payable on the gain on sale are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Based on the purchase price of $485 million, Agilysys expects to net after-tax proceeds of $340 million.
While the company anticipates the sale of the distribution business will close by March 31, 2007, the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and Agilysys shareholder approval.
 
Agilysys plans to hold a special meeting of shareholders on March 12, 2007 at 9 a.m. In connection with the special meeting, shareholders of record at January 31, 2007 are being asked to provide their votes on the proposals contained in the company's definitive proxy statement.

Business Outlook
Given the expected sale of KeyLink Systems, the company's previous business outlook for Fiscal 2007 is no longer applicable for the remaining business. Following the transaction close, Agilysys plans to issue Fiscal 2008 guidance.
The company has established a number of long-term goals:
Grow sales from approximately $500 million to $1 billion within two years and to $1.5 billion in three years. Much of this growth will come from acquisitions.
 - 
Target gross margins in excess of 20% and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of 6% within three years.
 - 
While in the near term return on invested capital will be diluted due to acquisitions and legacy costs, the company continues to target long-term return on capital of 15%.

On March 16, 2007, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the Second Amendment Agreement (the "Second Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, which is dated October 18, 2005. The Credit Agreement provides for loans and letters of credit aggregating to $200 million, including a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit issued by LaSalle Bank National Association or one of its affiliates and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements. A copy of the Credit Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K dated October 21, 2005.
The Second Amendment modified the terms of the Credit Agreement to allow for, among other things, the sale of the assets and operations of the Company's KeyLink Systems distribution business. Additionally, the Second Amendment replaced, revised, and added certain definitions in the Credit Agreement, including those impacting particular affirmative, negative, and financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. Under the Second Amendment, the Company is required to comply with the leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated net worth financial covenants beginning with the period ended December 31, 2007, subject to certain events and conditions that may accelerate the compliance requirement. The Company is also required to maintain available cash liquidity of at least $100 million until the effective date of the financial covenants discussed above.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
BOCA RATON, Fla.  April 2, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS) announced today it closed the sale of its KeyLink Systems Distribution Business assets to Arrow Electronics, Inc. Agilysys is now exclusively a leading provider of innovative IT solutions to the corporate and public sectors, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality.
The purchase price was $485 million in cash. Taxes payable on the gain on the sale are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Based on the purchase price, Agilysys expects to realize after-tax proceeds of $340 million. The purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment.
Arthur Rhein, Agilysys chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The close of the sale completes the strategic transformation we began in 2003 when we exited our former electronic components distribution business. As a company, we no longer operate distribution-related businesses and are now solely focused on selling IT solutions direct to end customers. We are enthusiastic about the many excellent long-term opportunities available to accelerate our growth as a solution provider. As we execute on these opportunities, we will enhance our ability to provide further differentiated value and greater rewards to customers and shareholders."
Rhein added, "Our creation and successful execution of a strategy to redeploy the asset base in support of growing our IT solutions business has resulted in a more profitable business and the creation of significant value for shareholders. From a stock price of $8.93 prior to the announcement of the divestiture of our electronic components distribution business in January 2003 to the closing price of $22.47 prior to today's announcement, the stock price has increased $13.54, or 152%."
New Strategic Direction and Business Outlook
As a solution provider, Agilysys will continue its growth as one of the leading providers of innovative IT solutions to the corporate and public sectors, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality. The company will continue to operate extensively throughout North America, with additional sales offices in China and the United Kingdom as a leading provider of:
The company will use the proceeds from the sale of KeyLink to fund a planned $100 million self-tender offer and to accelerate growth of the business, both organically and through acquisition. Based on its growth plans, the company has established a number of long-term financial goals:
 
Self-Tender Offer
As part of the company's financial strategy to increase flexibility and create value for shareholders, the Agilysys board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to six million common shares in an estimated $100 million self-tender offer, following the close of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. The ultimate number of shares and dollar value of the self-tender offer will be dependent on the share price and market conditions at the time. The company expects to commence the self-tender offer as soon as reasonably practicable.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposal of Assets.
On March 31, 2007 Agilysys, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilysys Canada Inc., (together, "Agilysys" or "Company") completed the previously announced sale of the assets and operations of its KeyLink Systems Distribution Business ("KeyLink Systems") to Arrow Electronics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Arrow Electronics Canada Ltd. and Support Net, Inc., (together, "Arrow") pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 2, 2007 by and among Agilysys as the seller and Arrow as the buyer. The Asset Purchase Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K dated January 5, 2007. The sale price was $485 million in cash and is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined shortly after close.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(b) Pro forma financial information
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Agilysys after giving effect to the sale of KeyLink Systems to Arrow, the receipt of net proceeds from the sale, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 gives effect to the transaction and adjustments as if they had occurred on the date of the balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 give effect to the transaction and adjustments as if they had occurred on April 1, 2003 and carried forward through the latest interim period presented.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, are not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial results would have been had the transaction taken place on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate the results of future operations.
The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes and are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of filing this Form 8-K.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 reflects the following adjustments:
(a) Assets sold and liabilities assumed by Arrow under the asset purchase agreement. These unaudited amounts represent KeyLink Systems assets and liabilities which will be sold to buyer as if the transaction had occurred on December 31, 2006.
(b) Reflects estimated proceeds to be received at the closing of sale of KeyLink Systems. The sale price of $485.0 million was reduced by $11.3 million of expenses for estimated transaction-related costs. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of operations do not reflect the recognition of these expenses as they are non-recurring in nature; however, these expenses will be reflected in the company's historical financial statements when the transaction is consummated. Additionally, there is potential for a working capital adjustment. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, if the net working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target net working capital, as defined in the agreement, then the purchase price will be adjusted upwards in the amount equal to the excess, and if the net working capital balance at the time of closing is less than the target net working capital, as defined in the agreement, then the purchase price will be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the deficiency.
(c) Reflects the anticipated $2.0 million restructuring charge and $109.3 million asset impairment charge for the write-off of goodwill, both directly related to the sale of KeyLink Systems, which will be reflected in the company's historical financial statements when the transaction is consummated to determine the gain on sale of net assets of KeyLink Systems. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income do not reflect the recognition of these expenses as they are non-recurring in nature.
(d) Reflects the excess of the estimated proceeds identified under (b) over the following:
     (i) The net book value of KeyLink Systems net assets sold of $35.0 million.
     (ii) Estimated taxes of $142.8 million.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflect the following adjustments:
(e) Elimination of operating results of KeyLink Systems. These amounts represent the unaudited statements of operations for KeyLink Systems for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
(f) Reflects corporate overhead allocations originally charged to KeyLink Systems in the operating results identified under (e) that would be recorded as an expense of the retained business.
(g) Reflects the tax effect of the sale of KeyLink Systems and pro forma adjustments calculated at the statutory rates of 38.7% for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and 40.3% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 25, 2007 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: May 25, 2007
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  May 25, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2007 unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year results for the periods ended March 31, 2007.
Strategic Transformation
As previously announced, on March 31, 2007 Agilysys closed the sale of its KeyLink Systems Distribution Business assets to Arrow Electronics, Inc. for $485 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, to focus exclusively on growing its IT solutions business. For purposes of financial reporting, this business is now treated as discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements.
Over the last six months, in addition to the divestiture of KeyLink Systems, Agilysys has announced three acquisitions. These include Visual One Systems, a leading developer and marketer of Microsoft Windows-based software for the hospitality industry; Stack Computer, a premier technology integrator with a strong focus in high availability storage infrastructure solutions; and, as announced in a separate news release today, an agreement to acquire Innovativ Systems Design, Inc., the largest U.S. commercial reseller of Sun Microsystems servers and storage products.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am extremely pleased with our progress. We have completed our transformation to a business focused solely on selling IT solutions direct to end customers. In addition, we continue to execute our strategic plan, including accelerating growth through acquisitions as a solution provider."
Acquisition of Innovativ
Agilysys announced today that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Innovativ Systems Design. Innovativ is an integrator and value-added reseller of servers, enterprise storage management products and professional services, and has a strong financial services and telecommunications industry presence. This acquisition will further diversify Agilysys' supplier mix, establish new markets and broaden Agilysys' customer base. Through the addition of Sun, the acquisition will also expand Agilysys' offerings to now include four of the most pervasive computer technology suppliers: EMC, HP, IBM and Sun. Over the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2007, Innovativ generated revenues of approximately $256 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") in excess of $20 million.
Acquisition of Stack Computer
On April 2, 2007, Agilysys announced the acquisition of Stack Computer, a privately held technology integrator with a strong focus in EMC-based high availability storage infrastructure solutions. Stack's customers include leading corporations in the financial services, healthcare and manufacturing industries. Strategically, the acquisition provides Agilysys with product solutions and services offerings that significantly enhance its storage and professional services businesses. Stack has annual revenues of
 
approximately $55 million. Stack's product category sales mix consists of approximately 62% hardware, 27% software and 11% services.
Rhein added, "I believe our financial performance, over the last six months in particular, given the level of activity around the divestiture and multiple acquisitions, is quite impressive. This bodes well for the future as we narrow our focus on growing the business and continue to provide increased shareholder value."
Continuing Operations
The descriptions for fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect financial information for Agilysys continuing operations.
Fiscal 2007 Fourth Quarter: Results from Continuing Operations
Sales for the fourth quarter increased 3% to $118.1 million, compared with $115.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
Fiscal 2007 fourth-quarter sales of hardware products were $87.7 million. Software sales were $7.8 million. Services sales were $22.6 million.
Gross margin from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased to 27.0% of sales from 22.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were $37.4 million, or 31.7% of sales, compared with $34.4 million, or 29.9% of sales in the same quarter a year ago. Fiscal 2007 fourth-quarter SG&A expenses include approximately $900,000 related to the company's acquisition of Visual One Systems as well as legacy overhead costs associated with discontinued operations. Agilysys will realize cost savings in fiscal 2008 based on restructuring of the business.
Loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter improved $1.0 million to $6.6 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $7.6 million, or 25 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago.
Fiscal 2007 Full Year: Results from Continuing Operations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, sales were $474.6 million, an increase of 1.2% over the $469.0 million in sales reported for the prior year.
Full-year sales of hardware products were $348.5 million. Software sales were $33.3 million. Services sales were $92.8 million.
Gross margin was 25.4% of sales, up 2.6 percentage points, from 22.8% in fiscal 2006. SG&A expenses increased to 28.1% of sales, from 26.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses include legacy overhead costs associated with discontinued operations.
Loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year improved $9.1 million to $11.6 million, or $0.38 per share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations in the previous year of $20.7 million, or $0.69 per share.
Restructuring Credit
Agilysys reported a net $2.5 million restructuring credit for fiscal 2007 fourth-quarter and full-year results. This included a $4.9 million credit resulting from the reversal of previous charge related to 2003 facility exit costs. The credit was partially offset by a restructuring charge of $2.4 million for severance and facility exit costs.
Business Outlook
In January 2007, upon announcing its intention to focus exclusively on selling IT solutions to corporate and public-sector customers, Agilysys established several long-term financial goals, including:
 
Rhein said, "Following the close of Innovativ and including the recent acquisition of Stack Computer, Agilysys will have pro forma revenues in excess of $800 million, well ahead of our initial expectations."
For fiscal 2008, the company currently estimates sales to be in the range of $770 million to $790 million. Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 23% of sales, with EBITDA margins of approximately 2% to 3% of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be in the range of $170 million to $173 million, including stock option expense of $4.8 million and approximately $6 million in new investments in software development and additional customer-facing employees. Interest income is expected to be approximately $17 million and the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 41.5% for the fiscal year. Based on an estimated 32 million shares outstanding, EPS is expected to be in the range of 40 to 50 cents per share.
Agilysys also expects fiscal 2008 capital expenditures of approximately $5 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $12 million, subject to finalizing FAS 142 intangible asset analysis on Visual One, Stack and Innovativ.

Rhein added that the acquisition of Innovativ is an important step in continuing Agilysys' growth as one of the leading providers of IT solutions to the corporate and public sectors.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  August 2, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2008 unaudited first-quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2007.
Financial Results
Sales for the first quarter increased 20% to $128.4 million, compared with $107.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from acquisitions accounted for $12.0 million or 56.3% of the growth. Growth in the base business contributed $9.3 million or 43.7% of the sales growth for the quarter.
Fiscal 2008 first-quarter sales of hardware products increased 20% to $91.0 million. Software sales increased 64% to $12.4 million, and services revenue increased 5% to $25.0 million.
Gross margin from continuing operations for the first quarter was $32.3 million, or 25.2% of sales, compared with $28.7 million, or 26.9% of sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Prior-year gross margin for the quarter was positively impacted by unusually high levels of price protection on certain products.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter were $37.6 million, or 29.3% of sales, compared with $31.4 million, or 29.3% of sales, in the same quarter a year ago. The $6.3 million increase in SG&A expenses included $4.3 million of incremental operating expenses from the company's recent acquisitions. The remaining $2.0 million was primarily due to a higher provision for doubtful accounts compared with the same quarter a year ago, as a result of year-over-year changes within aging in the company's trade accounts receivable. Excluding the $4.3 million in acquisition-associated operating costs, SG&A was down $4.1 million sequentially.
Net interest income for the first quarter was $6.8 million compared with $0.1 million in the same period last year. The improvement was due to the significantly higher cash position as a result of the sale of the company's KeyLink Systems Distribution Business.
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $2.7 million, or $0.08 per share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $2.8 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter last year.
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I couldn't be more pleased with all that we have achieved in the short time we have been operating solely as a leading provider of innovative IT solutions. Especially when you consider we sold our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business; successfully integrated Visual One Systems; announced and closed three acquisitions; and substantially increased organic sales. We will continue on our strategic course of
1
 
enhancing the value we provide for customers and shareholders by growing our business, both organically and through acquisitions."
Recent Acquisitions
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Agilysys completed the integration of Visual One Systems, as well as announced three acquisitions  Stack Computer, InfoGenesis and Innovativ Systems Design  all of which have now closed.
Business Outlook
In its fourth-quarter fiscal 2007 release issued May 25, 2007, Agilysys provided full-year guidance for fiscal 2008. As of the fiscal 2008 first quarter, the company is updating guidance to estimate annual sales in the range of $800 million to $820 million. Full-year gross margin is now expected to be approximately 24% of sales, with EBITDA margins of approximately 2.5% to 3% of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are now anticipated to be approximately 23% of sales, including stock option expense of $6.0 million and approximately $6.0 million in new investments in software development and additional customer-facing employees. Interest income is expected to be approximately $14 million and the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 41.5% for the fiscal year. Based on an estimated 32 million shares outstanding, earnings per share are expected to be
2
 
in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share.
Agilysys also expects fiscal 2008 capital expenditures of approximately $5 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million, subject to finalizing the intangible asset analysis on the company's recent acquisitions.

Item 8.01  Other Events.
On August 2, 2007 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release and conducted a conference call, both of which reported the Company's results for the fiscal 2008 first quarter ended June 30, 2007. The press release was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K dated August 2, 2007. During the conference call, management discussed the Company's previously announced intention to conduct a self-tender offer. Following are the related excerpts from the conference call that discussed the self-tender offer.
Plus the tender, can you just address the timing of that?
<Q  Brian Alexander>:
<>Should expect it to go down by approximately 100 million for the purchase of Innovativ which flows after quarter end. From a tender standpoint, as we discussed last quarter, there are a number of reasons that were impacting our decision with respect to timing. The first was ensuring that investors had adequate information about the surviving business as a standalone business and wanted to have at least this first quarter's results posted both sharing the form of the earnings release as well as our 10-Q filed and then wanted to ensure that investors had access to information on recent acquisitions.
A  Martin Ellis
:
Given the size of both the Innovativ and the InfoGenesis acquisitions, we want to ensure that that information is in investors hands before we initiate any tender offer and then there has been and was at the time the issue of dealing with material non-public information that we have and so with that, Brian, we are still committed to executing, but we are balancing all those issues as we establish a likely date for executing.
<>And then the chances of it happening in this calendar quarter, would you say are pretty high, given everything you just said?
Q  Brian Alexander
:
<>Yeah, it will depend on all the items that I discussed, Brian. I can not get into anything more specific with respect to timing.
A  Martin Ellis
:
<>Hi, I just have one follow-up question on your acquisition side. If I look at your balance sheet again roughly $260 million less after your Innovativ acquisition and you have roughly $100 million buyback program in place and so that means, is that a full  is it a strong commitment this share buyback program, and I think one of analyst had a question prior to this? So is it a firm commitment on the buyback?
Q  Sabu Joseph
:
<>The 100 million is an estimated number that we put out there. If you look at our prior communications that included an estimate on the dollars and what the board has authorized in terms of the number of shares. The board authorized 6 million shares at the time that  at the time that we go to market, we will consider at the time pricing, number of shares and total dollar value but the $100 million is the notional amount that we have communicated.
A  Martin Ellis
:
Okay [inaudible] during the calendar year, right?
<Q  Sabu Joseph>:
<>I cannot  I cannot be more definitive on timing.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IG Management Company, Inc. Santa Barbara, CA
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IG Management Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 in the financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), , effective January 1, 2006.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 IG Management Company, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, InfoGenesis and InfoGenesis Asia (Macau) Limited (the "Company"), is a California corporation engaged in the business of developing and marketing point-of-sale application software and systems for the hospitality and food service industries. IG Management Company, Inc. is a nonoperating holding company owning 100% of InfoGenesis and 6% of InfoGenesis Asia (Macau) Limited. InfoGenesis owns the remaining 94% of InfoGenesis Asia (Macau) Limited. There were no operations in InfoGenesis Asia (Macau) Limited in 2006 or 2005.
Business Activity and Basis of Presentation
The Company provides customer support that includes all aspects of system planning, installation, user training, and continuing product support. The Company's main office is located in Santa Barbara, CA, with customers located throughout the United States and internationally.
The Company is a majority-owned subsidiary of Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, L.P. The Company was acquired for $104,838,883 (includes purchase price plus cash held by the Company at the purchase date, plus or minus a working capital purchase price adjustment), plus the fair value of 38,644 unvested outstanding stock options and transaction costs. The Merger and Acquisition Agreement (the "Agreement") provided for an escrow account totaling $10,350,000 of which $500,000 was released to the buyer in 2004 and $2,727,500 in December 2005. The remaining amount was released to the seller in December 2005.
The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 7, the Company's difficulties in meeting its loan agreement covenants raise substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern and a significant portion of the Company's debt has been classified as current. Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, L.P. has committed to provide $10,000,000 through December 31, 2008, to support the Company, should the Company violate future covenants and be required to make payments on the outstanding debt.
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated.
Principles of Consolidation
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Cash Equivalents
 Inventories consist of computer hardware, computer software applications, documentation, and computer supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the weighted-average cost method.
Inventories
 Property and equipment were historically recorded at cost. In connection with the application of purchase accounting to the acquisition in 2004, property, equipment, and land and building were revalued and adjusted to fair market value.
Property and Equipment
 
Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. The building was depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life and was sold in 2006 (see Note 3).
 Revenue is recognized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, and SOP No. 98-9, Revenue is recognized in accordance with the above and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenue Recognition
Software Revenue Recognition,
Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions.
Most of the Company's customer arrangements contain multiple elements, consisting of software, both the Company's and that of third parties; hardware, principally point-of-sale terminals; installation services; and software support services. Under multiple-element arrangements, where each element is separately stated, priced, and sold, the Company allocates revenues to the various elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. The Company's VSOE of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately. If evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement but does not exist for all delivered elements in such arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue. Revenue is recognized for elements of the Company's arrangements as follows:
 Revenue from hardware sales and software licenses is recognized when the hardware and software is shipped, as this is when title passes, no significant vendor obligations exist, and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed reasonably assured.
Hardware Sales and Software Licenses
 Revenue from providing installation, software configuration, and project management services to customers is recognized as work is performed. Professional services revenues are accounted for separately from software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP No. 97-2. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, and timing of payments or acceptance criteria, if any, on the realizability of the professional service fees. Direct costs and expenses are expensed as revenue is recognized.
Professional Services
 Revenue from providing hosted application services is recognized on a straight-line basis, commencing from the start of the installation of the system and continuing throughout the term of the Service Level Agreement (SLA), generally 60 months. ASP fees are included in recurring service revenue in the accompanying statements of operations.
Application Service Provider (ASP) Fees
 Revenue from the software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the support period, generally one year. Software support services include access to technical content, as well as Internet and telephone access to
Software Maintenance Fees
 
technical support personnel. Software support also provides customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases, and patches released during the term of the support period. Software maintenance fees are included in recurring service revenue in the accompanying statements of operations.
 Training service revenues include instructor-led, media-based, and Internet-based training in the use of the Company's products. Training service revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered and are included in professional services revenue in the accompanying statements of operations.
Training Service Revenue
 Deferred revenue consists principally of customer advances on hardware and software sales and payments for annual software maintenance agreements and hosted application services with customers, whereby the Company receives payment in advance of performing the service. Revenue from the maintenance agreements and hosted application services is recognized ratably over the contract period, generally one year. The customer advances are applied against outstanding balances as hardware and software are shipped to the customer.
Deferred Revenue
 Customer deposits consist of amounts paid by ASP customers in accordance with the SLA. The customer deposits are held throughout the term of the SLA, typically five years.
Customer Deposits
 There were no sales in excess of 10% to a single customer for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Major Customers
 In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, , software costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the software is determined and the recovery of the cost can reasonably be expected, after which any additional costs are capitalized. With the exception of the Company's Analytics product, the Company has expensed all internally developed software development costs because the establishment of technological feasibility of products and their availability for sale have substantially coincided. During 2006 and 2005, the Company capitalized software costs of $733,140 and $180,000, respectively. Capitalization of these costs began when there was a detailed project plan, such that the product meets its design specifications and has therefore established technological feasibility and the Company determined that such costs are recoverable against future product sales. Capitalization of such costs ceased when the resulting product was available for general release to the public in April 2007. Management is required to use its judgment in the valuation of the unamortized capitalized software costs in determining whether the recorded value is recoverable based on future product sales.
Software Development Costs
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
 In accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, , the Company does not amortize goodwill. According to the Company's accounting policy, the Company performs an annual impairment review or more frequently if indicators of a potential impairment exist.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At September 30, 2005, the Company analyzed its long-term growth expectations as well as its operating expenses. The Company concluded that changing growth expectations and higher operating costs were events that could result in asset impairment. As a result, the Company performed an impairment analysis of identified intangibles with definite lives pursuant to
 
SFAS No. 144, , and an impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets pursuant to SFAS No. 142.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
In the first step, the Company concluded in an SFAS No. 144 impairment analysis that the carrying amount of the Company's long-lived assets was recoverable as the asset group's expected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company performed an impairment analysis of the Company's trademark and trade names and concluded that the estimated fair value did not exceed the carrying value and an impairment charge of $2,400,000 was recorded in 2005. As part of the analysis under SFAS No. 142, there is next a requirement for the Company's management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit as compared with estimated carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the estimated carrying value, then impairment is deemed to have occurred. The Company applied a present value technique utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. The Company then prepared a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill) as of September 30, 2005. Based on its impairment analysis, the Company concluded that $22,525,162 of recorded goodwill was impaired and an impairment charge was recorded in 2005. Impairment charges related to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles, and other identifiable intangibles with definite lives is expensed as a noncash charge to continuing operations when identified.
The Company's annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2006, resulted in no additional impairment losses.
 Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were $75,700 and $221,832 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Advertising
 Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities, based on statutory rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
Income Taxes
 As of December 31, 2006, there were 3,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, $0.01 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock authorized, $0.01 par value, of which 1,000,000 shares are designated as Series A convertible preferred stock, 250,000 shares are designated as Series B convertible preferred stock, and 115,593 shares are designated as Series C convertible preferred stock. At December 31, 2006, there were 2,273 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, 1,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding, 250,000 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding, and 115,593 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.
Capital Stock
The convertible preferred stock pays dividends at the rate of 8% per annum and is cumulative and fully participating, including voting privileges. However, as of December 31, 2006, no convertible preferred stock dividends had been declared by the Company's Board of Directors.
 
At December 31, 2006 and 2005, dividends in arrears on the 8% convertible preferred stock were $11.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
Each share of convertible preferred stock is entitled to such number of votes as shall equal the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of convertible preferred stock is then convertible.
Holders of convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive an amount equal to the per share base amount, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of payment of such amount to holders. After payment of the full liquidation amount, holders of convertible preferred stock shall share ratably (on an as converted basis) with the holders of the common stock in all remaining assets available for distribution to stockholders.
The convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock of the Company equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the liquidation amount by the conversion price. The liquidation amount is equal to the original issuance price plus all accrued (whether or not declared) and unpaid dividends. The conversion price is equal to the original issuance price.
The aggregate liquidation preference, which is determined as the stated value of the convertible preferred stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, in 2006 and 2005 for the Company's convertible preferred stock was as follows (in thousands):
 The Company's financial instruments are primarily composed of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. One customer accounted for approximately 9% and 14% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality credit institutions.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Use of Estimates
 The Company regularly reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an impairment loss.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 The Company adopted a stock option plan (the "Plan") during 2000, which provided for the issuance of up to 118,015 shares of common stock, available for employees and consultants. Stock options granted under the Plan could be incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options.
Stock-Based Compensation
 
In accordance with the terms of the December 2004 Merger and Acquisition Agreement, the 2000 Plan was terminated. The Merger and Acquisition Agreement provided for all unvested options under the Plan to be converted at the same intrinsic value to options granted under a new option plan. In May 2005, the Company adopted a stock option plan (the "2005 Plan"), which provided for the issuance of up to 330,000 shares of common stock, available for employees and consultants. The unvested options from the Plan were converted to options under the 2005 Plan at a reverse split of 16.947 to 1. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan may be incentive stock options, to all employees (including officers) of the Company or, in the case of nonstatutory stock options, all employees (including officers) or consultants of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, 65,175 options were available for future grant under the 2005 Plan.
The exercise price of the stock options on the date of grant, which represents the estimated fair value, is determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted become exercisable over two to five years and expire within 10 years from the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), , which replaces SFAS No. 123, , and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, . This pronouncement requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense based on their fair values. The Company implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Prior to implementation of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and related interpretations in accounting for stock option plans. This resulted in the Company reporting compensation costs based on the intrinsic value of the awards, which is the difference between the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price.
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
For the year ended December 31, 2005, a table illustrating the effect on operating results had compensation cost for the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition been determined based on the fair value-based method consistent with SFAS No. 123 is as follows:
 
The fair value of unvested options for the year ended December 31, 2005, assumed at the acquisition date were determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model utilizing the following assumptions:
As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the Company's loss before income taxes and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006, are $22,633 and $17,507, respectively, higher than if it had continued to account for stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company reported all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock-based awards as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows. Under SFAS 123(R), the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those options are to be classified as financing cash flows.
The Company calculates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula. Share-based compensation expense charged against net loss for stock options granted is based on the grant-date fair value as adjusted for estimated forfeitures based on awards expected to vest. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Stock-based compensation expense is amortized over the option vesting period and recorded as stock compensation expense in the Company's income statement and totaled $305,996 and $899,035 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with related income tax benefits of $65,053 and $189,574 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the expense in 2006, $75,309 is in research and development expenses; $103,395 in selling, general, and administrative expenses; and $127,292 in cost of revenues. All 2005 expenses are in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The following tables summarize the stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:
 
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006, was $.91. There were no stock option grants in 2005.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, was $2,096 and $0, respectively. The Company received $3,702 and $0 from the exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
As of December 31, 2006, there was $631,614 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.3 years.
The fair value of each stock option awarded during the year ended December 31, 2006, was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and amortized to expense over the option's vesting periods with the following assumptions:
The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury security rate in effect as of the date of grant. The expected lives of options for the year ended December 31, 2006, were based on the weighted-average expected life of each tranche of the stock option, determined based on the sum of each of the tranche's vesting period plus one-half of the period from the vesting date of each tranche to the stock options expiration. This method is available to options granted prior to December 31, 2007. The expected stock price volatility was based on the volatility of publicly traded companies within the same industry sector.
 Unearned stock option expense totaling $1,416,687, as measured pursuant to APB Opinion No. 25 based on the intrinsic value of unvested awards outstanding as of January 1, 2006, was reversed with the offset to additional paid-in capital.
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
A cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was recorded for $140,948 to adjust previously recognized stock option compensation expense for estimated future forfeitures with a related reduction to the deferred tax benefit of $41,536.

9. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA) WITH CUSTOMERS
The Company offers its software application for sale as an ASP. The Company enters into an SLA with the customer; this agreement defines the terms of service provided by the Company. The agreements are generally for a 60-month period, and the customer may elect to pay on a monthly, quarterly, or annual billing cycle. Customers are required to make a deposit under the agreement, which is applied to the final payments under the contract. The SLA is cancelable by either party, as defined in the SLA. If the customer elects to cancel the agreement, an early termination fee is calculated based on a percentage of the remaining payments under the contract. The termination fee percentage applied corresponds to the cancellation date as it occurs in the following contract periods:
35% if canceled within 12 months 30% if canceled within 24 months 25% if canceled within 36 months 20% if canceled within 48 months 15% if canceled within 60 months

13. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, , which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and the provisions of SFAS 159 will be applied prospectively as of that date. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Fair Value Measurements
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, . FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on accounting for recognition, interest, penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and classification of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes and transitional requirements upon adoption of FIN No. 48. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this interpretation will have on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
 
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, . This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, , and FASB Statement No. 3, , and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Consequently, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 154 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

AS OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007 AND 2006
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
IG Management Company, Inc. is a California corporation and together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries InfoGenesis and InfoGenesis Asia (Macau) Limited (the "Company"), are engaged in the business of developing and marketing point-of-sale application software and systems for the hospitality and food service industries. The Company provides customer support that includes all aspects of system planning, installation, user training, and continuing product support. The Company's main office is located in Santa Barbara, CA, with customers located throughout the United States and internationally.
Financial Statement Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all information and disclosures necessary for a presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2007, as well as the condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 have been prepared by the Company without audit. However, the financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature.
Significant Accounting Policies
A detailed description of the Company's significant accounting policies can be found in the audited annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which are included as exhibit 99.1 of the accompanying Form 8-K/A. There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by Federal or state taxing authorities. The adoption of FIN 48 has resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to increase beginning accumulated deficit by $1.0 million, which included tax contingencies, interest and penalties. At January 1, 2007, the Company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 million (including accrued interest and penalties of $0.4 million). Approximately $1.3 million of this, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. There are no ongoing audits for any taxing jurisdiction where the Company is subject to tax, other than a

Federal review of the Company's 2004 return. Given that the Company cannot predict whether there will be any matters pursued by this taxing authority or whether any other specific taxing jurisdiction will select the Company's tax returns to review, it is impractical to determine the amounts which will otherwise be recorded in the effective rate over the next 12 months. Interest and penalties recognized on unrecognized tax benefits are classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.

INNOVATIV SYSTEMS DESIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
Board of Directors Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America as established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Operations
Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Innovativ") are an integrator and value-added reseller of servers, enterprise storage management products and professional services. Headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, Innovativ operates throughout the United States of America.
Significant Accounting Policies
Following is a description of the most significant accounting policies used by the Company to prepare the consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to continuing operations.
Following is a description of the Company's wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries:
Wild Empire, LLC
Wild Empire, LLC ("Wild Empire") was organized as a Colorado Limited Liability Company in June 2004 by the Company and, at that time, a minority owner. Wild Empire was established to create and to acquire content to provide unique interactive experiences using a variety of technology and digital formats. The Company initially owned 63.5% of Wild Empire. However, in 2005, the Company acquired the minority member's 36.5% interest resulting in 100% ownership of Wild Empire. As more fully described in Note 2 below, subsequent to acquiring the minority member's interest in Wild Empire, the Company discontinued the operations of Wild Empire in 2005.
Clique Communications, LLC
Clique Communications, LLC ("Clique") was organized as a New Jersey Limited Liability Company in April 2004 as a successor entity to Net Gen Video, LLC, whose net assets were acquired by Clique. The Company owned 100% of Clique. Clique was organized to continue the development of proprietary software to produce a commercially viable video communication system. Its activities have been limited to research and development, developing markets, and recruiting and training personnel. In 2006, the Company distributed, as a dividend, pro rata to each of the Company's shareholders all of the Company's ownership in Clique. The distribution was equal to the carrying value of the net assets of Clique at the time of distribution. The distribution of the units of Clique to the Company's shareholders has been treated as a disposal of a component of an entity. See Note 2 for a discussion of the discontinued operations.
 
Verifichi LLC
Verifichi LLC ("Verifichi") was formed as a New Jersey Limited Liability Company in December 2004. The Company owned 100% of Verifichi. Verifichi was organized to develop and sell software technologies, products, and services to both the Company and third-party businesses. In 2006, the Company distributed, as a dividend, pro rata to each of the Company's shareholders all of the Company's ownership in Verifichi. The distribution was equal to the carrying value of the net assets of Verifichi at the time of distribution. The distribution of the units of Verifichi to the Company's shareholders has been treated as a disposal of a component of an entity. See Note 2 for a discussion of the discontinued operations.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from three primary sources: hardware, remarketed software, and servicesboth proprietary and third-party. Revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company reduces revenue for discounts, estimated customer returns and other allowances.
Regarding hardware sales, revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are not unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement. Regarding remarketed software sales, revenue is generally recognized when the software is delivered, as software sales generally do not require significant production, modification, or customization at the time of delivery (physically or electronically) to the customer. For software delivered electronically, delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software. Regarding sales of services, the Company offers proprietary and third-party services to its customers. Proprietary services generally are as follows: consulting, installation and integration. Revenue relating to proprietary services is recognized when the service is performed. In addition to proprietary services, the Company offers third-party service contracts to its customers. In such instances, the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the Company bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer. Since the Company is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions, the Company reports revenue only in the amount of the "commission" (equal to the selling price less the cost of sale) received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale.
Shipping and Handling Costs
The Company records the amount of shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue. The cost incurred for shipping and handling has been included in cost of sales.
 
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. The total amount of advertising costs charged to expense was $0.1 million in 2006, $0.4 million in 2005 and $0.4 million in 2004.
Defined Contribution Benefit Plan
The Company maintains an affiliated group qualified 401(k) profit sharing plan that covers substantially all full time employees of the Company who have completed 30 days of service. The Company funds matching contributions into the plan equal to 50 percent of the employee's salary deferral, not to exceed 3 percent of compensation. Total Company matching contributions, net of forfeitures were $0.3 million in 2006, $0.2 million in 2005 and $0.2 million in 2004.
Income Taxes
The Company has elected under the Internal Revenue Code to be a non-taxpaying entity for federal and state income tax purposes. In lieu of income taxes, the owners are taxed on their proportionate share of the Company's taxable income. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the consolidated financial statements. Provision has been made for state income taxes, where applicable.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company maintains cash balances at several banks. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000. The Company also maintains cash balances in money market funds. Such balances are not insured. The money market fund balance was $10.9 million and $3.2 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
In connection with the severance arrangement discussed under Note 3 below, the Company has placed monies in escrow as security against the obligations due under the severance arrangement. Such amounts have been classified as "restricted cash" included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts based on past credit history, write-offs and collections. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus trade receivables do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be applied to such receivables that are past due. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and does not normally require collateral to support such receivables.
Approximately 50%, 57%, and 75% of the Company's gross revenues in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, were derived from the Company's four largest customers. Approximately 51% and 42% of the Company's trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, was made up of individual customer balances that exceeded 10% of aggregate trade accounts receivable.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Inventories
Inventories are generally comprised of computer hardware held for resale and are reported at the lower of cost determined by specific identification or market.
Long-Lived Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: computer equipment and software  3 to 7 years; office furniture and equipment  5 to 7 years; and leasehold improvements  over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.
Stockholders' Equity
The following table summarizes the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity presented in the consolidated balance sheet:
 
Vendor Incentives
The Company participates in certain programs provided by its suppliers that enable it to earn volume incentives. The amounts earned under these programs are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when earned and classified as a reduction of accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Concentration of Supplier Risk
The Company's vendor purchases were predominantly from one supplier in 2006, 2005, and 2004. The supplier possesses a security interest in the Company's equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Cash paid for income taxes was $0.1 million, $44,000, and $0.3 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Reclassification
Certain amounts in the prior periods' consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
2. Discontinued Operations
The operating results of the discontinued operations described below have been classified as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
Wild Empire, LLC
As discussed under Note 1, Wild Empire became a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2005. Due to lack of revenue generated by Wild Empire, in late 2005 the Company discontinued its operations. Property and equipment, including production equipment, with a net carrying value of $0.1 million was written-off in connection with the discontinuance of Wild Empire's operations. Additionally, exit costs of $0.5 million relating to operating lease commitments were recognized with the discontinuance of Wild Empire's operations. Both costs have been classified as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated income statement.
The results of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the following relating to Wild Empire:
Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are total assets of $0.1 million and $0.2 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and total liabilities of $0.3 million and $0.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to Wild Empire. Such amounts have been classified as a component of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. The assets are principally made up of amounts receivable at each year-end. The liabilities are principally made up of an accrual for the payment of ongoing operating lease commitments.
 
Clique Communications, LLC
During 2006, the Company distributed, as a dividend, its ownership of Clique to the shareholders of the Company. The net assets of Clique were considered disposed as of the dividend date. Accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of Clique have been classified as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Verifichi LLC
During 2006, the Company distributed, as a dividend, its ownership of Verifichi to the shareholders of the Company. The net assets of Verifichi were considered disposed as of the dividend date.

3. Severance Obligation
In 2006, the Company entered into a $0.5 million severance obligation with a former employee in settlement of involuntary termination of employment.
In 2003, the Company entered into a severance obligation with two former employees in settlement of compensation due to the employees. Under the severance agreement, the Company was obligated to pay $4.0 million to the former employees, of which $1.2 million was paid upon execution of the severance
 
agreement. The remaining $2.8 million was being paid in 14 equal semi-annual installments without interest commencing October 15, 2003 with the final payment due April 15, 2010. The present value of the remaining severance obligation (after payment of the $1.2 million upon execution of the severance agreement) was initially recognized as a liability by the Company using a four percent discount rate.
Following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the severance obligation:
In 2006, $1.4 million of the remaining severance obligation was classified as a long term liability and $0.4 million was classified as an accrued liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In 2005, $1.3 million of the remaining severance obligation was classified as a long term liability and $0.3 million was classified as an accrued liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
The Company placed $0.4 million, plus interest, in escrow as security against its future obligations under the severance agreement. The amount held in escrow is classified as restricted cash included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The interest earned on monies held in escrow is classified as interest income in the accompanying consolidated income statement.
On June 29, 2007, the Company paid the remaining severance liability of $1.3 million as a result of the merger with Agilysys, Inc. Severance payments of $0.5 million were made during the normal course of business in the first half of 2007.
4. Investment Losses

The Company also invested in a minority interest share of preferred stock with a privately held unaffiliated company in 2004, which discontinued operations in 2005, and the investment was deemed worthless. As a result, the Company recognized an investment loss of $0.3 million in 2005 for the write-off of its investment, which was classified within "other expenses" in the accompanying consolidated income statement.

1. Financial Statement Presentation
Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Innovativ") are an integrator and value-added reseller of servers, enterprise storage management products and professional services. Headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, Innovativ operates throughout the United States of America.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all information and disclosures necessary for a presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2007, as well as the condensed consolidated income statements and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 have been prepared by the Company without audit. However, the financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to continuing operations.
Significant Accounting Policies
A detailed description of the Company's significant accounting policies can be found in the audited annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which are included as exhibit 99.1 of the accompanying Form 8-K/A. There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein.
2. Severance Obligation
In 2006, the Company entered into a $0.5 million severance obligation with a former employee in settlement of involuntary termination of employment.
In 2003, the Company entered into a severance obligation with two former employees in settlement of compensation due to the employees. Under the severance agreement, the Company was obligated to pay $4.0 million to the former employees, of which $1.2 million was paid upon execution of the severance agreement. The remaining $2.8 million was being paid in 14 equal semi-annual installments without interest commencing October 15, 2003 with the final payment due April 15, 2010. The present value of the remaining severance obligation (after payment of the $1.2 million upon execution of the severance agreement) was initially recognized as liability by the Company using a four percent discount rate.
 
Following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the severance obligation:
The Company placed $0.4 million, plus interest, in escrow as security against its future obligations under the severance agreement. The amount held in escrow is classified as restricted cash included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The interest earned on monies held in escrow is classified as interest income in the accompanying consolidated income statement.
On June 29, 2007, the Company paid the remaining severance liability of $1.3 million as a result of the merger with Agilysys, Inc. Severance payments of $0.5 million were made during the normal course of business in the first half of 2007.

Exhibit 99.3
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for Agilysys, Inc. ("Agilysys" or "Company") set forth below gives effect to the acquisition of Innovative Systems Design, Inc. (d/b/a Innovativ Systems Design, Inc.) ("Innovativ") using the purchase method of accounting after giving effect to the adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations includes only the results of continuing operations and excludes such impacts as nonrecurring items related to the acquisition and synergy and related cost savings associated with the integration of the acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 gives effect to the acquisition as if it occurred on April 1, 2006 by combining the results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 of Agilysys with the results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 of Innovativ. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2007 gives effect to the acquisition of Innovativ as if it occurred on that date.
The Company has accounted for the acquisition as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Innovativ will be recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values and consolidated with those of the Company.
The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, including an evaluation of acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, the allocation of the acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to modification in the future, which will include the identification of intangible assets.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements used in the preparation of such pro forma financial information. The Company's historical financial statements used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Innovativ's historical financial statements used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are included as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the notes thereto, are not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial results would have been had the transaction taken place on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate the results of future operations. The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes and are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of filing this Form 8-K/A.
The unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.
 
See notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

1. Purchase Price
Agilysys acquired all of the outstanding shares of Innovativ for $100 million, which was funded by cash. The acquisition price is subject to a working capital adjustment. Additionally, Agilysys will pay an earn-out of two dollars for every dollar of EBITDA greater than $50 million in cumulative EBITDA over the first two years after closing. The earn-out will be limited to a maximum payout of $90 million. The working capital adjustment and potential earn-out payment by Agilysys are considered to be contingent elements of the acquisition that are not recognized until the contingencies have been resolved (i.e. the closing working capital has been established and the earn-out target has been met). Accordingly, the working capital adjustment and potential earn-out payment of up to $90 million has not been recognized in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information

The historical financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 that are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations include the following nonrecurring events:

On September 11, 2007, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the Third Amendment Agreement (the "Third Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated October 18, 2005 ("Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for loans and letters of credit aggregating to $200 million, including a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit issued by LaSalle Bank National Association or one of its affiliates and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements. A copy of the Credit Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K dated October 21, 2005.
The purpose of the Third Amendment, among other things, is to modify certain financial covenants and other terms to reflect the potential repurchase by the Company of up to an additional two million of its shares subject to a maximum repurchase of eight million shares and $150 million. In particular, the Third Amendment replaced the definitions of 2007 Redemption, Consolidated Fixed Charges and Restricted Payments, as well as added definitions for Excluded Share Repurchases, Open Market Repurchases, Open Market Repurchase Amount, and Open Market Repurchase Period. Additionally, the Third Amendment replaced the definition of Consolidated Net Worth within the financial covenant provisions and amended Schedule 3 (guarantors of payment) to the Credit Agreement to reflect changes in the Company's domestic guarantors of payment.
The description of the Third Amendment set forth in this Item 2.03 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amendment filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  September 14, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced today that it has filed amendments to the Form 8-Ks that it had previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its acquisitions of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc. and InfoGenesis. These amendments include audited historical financial statements and pro forma financial information for the acquired companies. Agilysys announced its intent to file these amendments in its release of August 21, 2007.
In connection with the completion of the audit of the historical financial statements of Innovativ, the amendments reflect certain accounting policies that were conformed to Agilysys' current practices, which are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting policies relate to revenues generated from the sale of third-party service contracts. In the historical consolidated income statements included in the Form 8-K amendments, these service revenues now reflect "commission" received (equal to the selling price less the cost of sale), rather than the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale. Although conformity of this accounting policy results in a reduction of net sales presented in the consolidated income statements, there is no impact on gross margin or operating results.
Shareholders and other interested parties are encouraged to review the Form 8-K amendments, together with the company's other financial filings and communications, to gain a more complete understanding of the acquired companies' impact on Agilysys' business.
Portions of this release, particularly the statements made by management and those that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Agilysys.

     99.1 Press Release, dated September 20, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  September 20, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced today the preliminary results of its previously announced "Dutch Auction" tender offer, which expired at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 19, 2007.
On August 21, 2007, Agilysys announced the commencement of the tender offer to purchase up to 6,000,000 common shares at a price not less than $16.25 nor greater than $18.50 per share. The closing price of Agilysys shares on September 19, 2007, was $18.18 per share. Based on a preliminary count by National City Bank, the depositary for the tender offer, Agilysys expects to accept for purchase 4,722,811 of its common shares at a purchase price of $18.50 per share, for a total cost of approximately $87.4 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. These shares represent 15% of the outstanding common shares as of August 15, 2007.
Based on a preliminary count by the depositary, 4,722,811 shares were properly tendered at prices at or below the purchase price, including 2,100,892 shares that were tendered through the notice of guaranteed delivery, making the tender offer undersubscribed by 1,277,189 shares, or approximately 21%.
"With this tender offer, we have successfully allowed shareholders an opportunity to liquidate all or a portion of their investment following the divestiture of our KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. And at the same time, non-tendering shareholders will increase their pro rata ownership in the company and our future operations," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The fact that the offer was undersubscribed indicates that our current strategy of growing our IT solutions business has strong support from our shareholders."
The number of shares to be purchased and the purchase price per share are preliminary and subject to verification by the depositary. Final results for the tender offer will be determined subject to confirmation by the depositary of the proper delivery of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn. The actual number of shares to be purchased and the purchase price per share will be announced following the completion of the confirmation process. Payment for the shares accepted for purchase under the tender offer, and return of all other shares tendered and not purchased, will occur promptly thereafter.
The company intends to repurchase the tendered shares using cash on hand. Following this repurchase, Agilysys will have approximately $170 million in cash on hand and $200 million available for borrowings under its credit facility. Management is confident that the combination of existing cash on hand and the current credit facility provides sufficient financial flexibility to fund the company's growth strategy.
As was previously announced, Agilysys has adopted a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 of the company's shares and has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan to facilitate the repurchase of shares under the repurchase program. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, the open market repurchase program will not commence until at least 10 business days after the termination of the tender offer.
 
Agilysys anticipates that the 10b5-1 Plan will be in place for one year following the expiration of the tender offer.
Portions of this release, particularly the statements made by management and those that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Agilysys. Many factors could cause Agilysys actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include those referenced in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or as may be described from time to time in Agilysys subsequent SEC filings.

Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to Agilysys anticipated revenue gains, sales volume, margin improvements, cost savings, and new product introductions.
Other associated risks include geographic factors, political and economic risks, the actions of Agilysys competitors, changes in economic or industry conditions or in the markets served by Agilysys, and the ability to appropriately integrate acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla., Oct. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced today that Eileen M. Rudden has been appointed to its nine-member board of directors to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Thomas C. Sullivan. Rudden, 57, succeeds Sullivan, 70, who retired on October 24, 2007, after 23 years of service on the board.
Rudden most recently served as vice president and general manager of the Unified Communications Division of Avaya, Inc., a $5.1 billion provider of communications systems. Avaya designs, builds and manages communications networks for more than 1 million businesses worldwide, and is a global leader in secure and reliable Internet Protocol (IP) telephony systems and communications software applications and services.
Before joining Avaya, Rudden was a 14-year veteran of IBM's Lotus Software unit, where she was senior vice president and general manager responsible for Lotus Notes and Domino, the leading e-mail and groupware provider. Under her leadership, revenue for Lotus Notes/Domino tripled to $700 million worldwide while users grew from 5 million to 50 million in four years. Before joining Lotus Development in 1986, she was a director at Wang Laboratories and a manager at The Boston Consulting Group. Rudden is also the former CEO of FairMarket, Inc., which was sold to eBay.
She currently serves as a trustee of Brown University, where she is the chair of the audit committee and a member of the advisory and executive committee. From 1999 until May of 2007, Rudden served as board member and audit committee member at John H. Harland Company, recently sold to M&F Worldwide.
Between 1996 and 2004, Rudden was a trustee of Lesley University, serving as treasurer, chair of the finance committee and chair of the audit committee during her tenure. Rudden is a member of the advisory board of the Pew Charitable Trust's Internet and American Life Project, as well as the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education.
A graduate of Brown University, Rudden also earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University.
"Eileen's vast knowledge of the information technology solutions business will be an invaluable asset to our board and our company as we continue our growth as a leading provider of IT solutions," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "I am confident that Eileen's contributions to the board will be felt immediately."
 
Sullivan, chairman of RPM International, Inc., was an Agilysys board member from 1984 through October 2007. "On behalf of the board, our shareholders and the entire management team, I would like to thank Tom for his years of dedicated service to Agilysys," Rhein said. "His extensive knowledge regarding mergers and acquisitions and his business insight have been of immense help as we mapped our strategic transformation. We greatly appreciate his many contributions."

BOCA RATON, Fla.  November 1, 2007  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2008 unaudited second-quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2007.
Sales for the second quarter increased 100% to $196.2 million, compared with $97.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Growth in the base business contributed $18.3 million or 18.6% of the sales increase for the quarter, representing an increase of 18.7% compared with last year. Revenue from acquisitions contributed $80.0 million, or 81.4%, of the increase.
Second-Quarter Results of Operations
Fiscal 2008 second-quarter sales of hardware products increased 125.9% to $146.9 million. Software sales increased 131.8% to $14.6 million, and services revenue increased 30.5% to $34.7 million.
Gross margin for the second quarter was $42.8 million, or 21.8% of sales, compared with $24.5 million, or 25.0% of sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The decline in gross margin percentage was due to the change in customers and the resulting product mix in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter were in line with the company's expectations at $46.4 million, or 23.6% of sales, compared with $31.5 million, or 32.2% of sales, in the same quarter a year ago. The $14.8 million increase in SG&A expenses was due to the company's recent acquisitions, including $14.3 million of incremental operating expenses and $0.3 million of one-time expenses.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $3.5 million compared with $0.6 million in the same period last year. The improvement was due to the company's significantly higher cash position as a result of the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, and lower average debt levels compared with last year.
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $1.4 million, or $0.05 per share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $4.8 million, or a loss of $0.16 per share, for the second quarter last year. Net income for the second quarter was $3.4 million compared with $5.5 million last year. Last year's second-quarter net income includes $10.3 million from discontinued operations of the distribution business, which the company divested earlier this year.
EBITDA from continuing operations (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and results of discontinued operations) was a loss of $0.5 million for the current quarter, compared with a loss of $5.1 million last year. (NOTE: A reconciliation of net earnings to EBITDA is provided in the financial tables included in this release. This financial measure of profitability is included to supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in this press release. See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" section in this release for further information.)
 
Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, said, "I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made both strategically and tactically. The substantial growth in our revenues this quarter was the result of our organic business outperforming the market, and the full-quarter contributions of our newly acquired businesses. SG&A as a percent of net sales has declined significantly from a year ago, further demonstrating our ability to improve our operating leverage."
For the six months ended September 30, 2007, sales were $324.6 million, a 58.3% increase compared with sales of $205.0 million reported for the comparable period last year. Organic growth accounted for $27.6 million, or 23.1%, of the increase in sales, representing a 13.5% increase as compared with last year. Incremental sales from the company's recent acquisitions accounted for $92.0 million, or 76.9%, of the increase.
Six-Month Results of Operations
First-half sales of hardware products were $237.9 million, up 69.0% from $140.8 million in the first half of last year. Software sales were $27.0 million, up 94.5% from $13.9 million a year ago. Services revenue was $59.7 million, up 18.5% from $50.4 million in last year's first six months.
Gross margin for the first half was 23.1% of sales, compared with 26.0% in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $84.0 million, or 25.9% of sales, for the first half, compared with $62.9 million, or 30.7%, in the prior year.
The company recorded income from continuing operations for the first six months of $4.1 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with a loss of $7.6 million, or a loss of $0.25 per share, for the same period a year ago. Net income for the first six months, including discontinued operations, was $6.0 million compared with $12.2 million a year ago.
"Our current performance, including our successful acquisition integrations and strong cash position, certainly bodes well as we continue to execute our strategy, and we are on target to meet or exceed our stated goals," said Rhein.
On July 2, 2007, Agilysys completed its most recent acquisition of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc., a privately held integrator and value-added reseller of servers, enterprise storage management products and professional services. Innovativ is the largest U.S. commercial reseller of Sun Microsystems servers and storage products. With the company's Sun relationship and strong presence in financial services and telecommunications, the acquisition further diversifies Agilysys' supplier mix, establishes new markets and broadens the company's customer base.
Acquisition of Innovativ Completed
Innovativ's accounting policies have been conformed to Agilysys' current practices, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The primary change in Innovativ's accounting policies relates to revenues generated from the sale of third-party service contracts which now reflect "commission" received (equal to the selling price less the cost of sale), rather than the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale.  Although conformity of this accounting policy results in a reduction of net sales, there is no impact on gross profit or operating results. Gross revenues for Innovativ were previously reported at approximately $256 million. With the adjustment for services, revenues were $235 million. The impact of the adjustment has been reflected in Agilysys' revenue guidance for fiscal 2008.
Cash and cash equivalents were $167.8 million compared with $604.7 million at March 31, 2007. For the first six months of fiscal 2008, the company used cash for income tax payments of $127.8 million related to the operating results and gain on the sale of the KeyLink Systems Distribution Business, along with a $10.8 million working capital adjustment (of which $10.0 million was accrued at year-end) and $13.2 million in fees and contingencies, all as a result of the sale. In addition, the company paid $212.8 million
Balance Sheet and Treasury Highlights
 
for the acquisitions of Innovativ, Stack Computer and InfoGenesis, and $86.1 million for the purchase of treasury shares through its self-tender offer in the second quarter. Excluding taxes and transaction expenses associated with the divestiture of KeyLink Systems, the company generated $8.5 million in cash flow from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2008.
As of September 30, 2007, accounts receivable were $172.2 million, an increase of 47.5%, or $55.4 million, compared with $116.7 million at March 31, 2007. Inventory was $16.5 million at September 30, 2007, compared with $9.9 million at March 31, 2007. Accounts payable of $119.8 million increased 42% from $84.3 million at March 31, 2007. For the first six months of fiscal 2008, the increases in receivables, payables and inventory were due to the overall increase in company sales and the impact of recent acquisitions.
Net working capital was 5% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. This reflects an improvement from 7.7% a year ago, and is in line with the company's goal of keeping working capital at approximately 5% of sales.
On September 26, 2007, Agilysys announced the final results of its "Dutch Auction" tender offer, which expired September 19, 2007. The company accepted for purchase 4,653,287 shares at a price of $18.50 per share, for a total cost of approximately $86.1 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. The shares repurchased in the tender offer represented approximately 15% of the company's outstanding shares. Following the tender offer, Agilysys has approximately 26.8 million shares outstanding.
Share Repurchases
Also, as previously announced, Agilysys has adopted a program to repurchase up to an additional 2,000,000 shares in the open market and has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan to facilitate the repurchase of shares. As of October 26, 2007, 445,602 common shares have been repurchased for approximately $7.6 million under the plan. The company anticipates that the 10b5-1 Plan will be in place for up to one year following the expiration of the tender offer.
As of the fiscal 2008 second quarter, the company is refining guidance to account for half-year performance and the change to Innovativ revenue accounting policies discussed above. Revenue guidance is adjusted to reflect Innovativ services as net versus gross, as previously reported. The impact of this accounting policy adjustment is to reduce sales by approximately $20 million. As a result, annual sales are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $800 million. Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 23.5% of sales, with EBITDA margins of approximately 2.5% to 3% of sales.
Business Outlook
SG&A expenses are anticipated to be approximately $179 million, including stock option expense of $6.0 million and approximately $6.0 million in new investments in software development and additional customer-facing employees. Interest income is expected to be approximately $13.5 million and the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 41.5% for the fiscal year. Based on an estimated 28.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, earnings per share are expected to remain in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share.
Agilysys also expects fiscal 2008 capital expenditures of approximately $5 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million, subject to finalizing the intangible asset analysis on the company's recent acquisitions.
The company continues to be on track to achieve its already stated long-term financial goals including:
 
A conference call to discuss second-quarter and year-to-date results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, November 1, 2007. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

To supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP in this press release, the company uses the non-GAAP financial measure of EBITDA, defined as net income minus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is further adjusted to remove the results of discontinued operations to arrive at EBITDA from continuing operations.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Management reviews these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the company's performance. Additionally, management believes that such information can enhance investors' understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures within the accompanying table, as required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  January 30, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced today it has extended its existing employment agreement with Arthur Rhein, the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, consistent with the execution of the company's strategic plan and previously communicated financial goals. Rhein's employment agreement was extended for an additional year, from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010, at his current salary, and includes a grant of 70,000 performance shares vesting solely on the achievement of financial targets established for the executive officer long-term incentive plan.
The Board of Directors indicated the extension demonstrates its strong endorsement of Rhein's leadership, and the successful track record of the management team, in strategically transforming the business and profitably redeploying the company's asset base to seize growth opportunities and generate shareholder value.
Rhein was named president and chief executive officer in April 2002 and chairman in April 2003. Under his leadership, the company has implemented a series of acquisitions and divestitures to move higher up the IT value scale where it can further differentiate itself and realize higher margins.
In March 2007, the company divested its KeyLink Systems Distribution Business. Management has made significant progress toward its aggressive financial goals stated at the time of the divestiture. These goals include doubling sales to $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2009 (which ends March 31, 2009) and tripling sales to $1.5 billion by fiscal 2010, achieving gross margins in excess of 20% and EBITDA margins of 6%. As a result of strong organic growth and the four acquisitions the company has completed since January 2007, its annual revenue run rate is now approximately $850 million.
Interested parties can review details of the extension agreement by consulting the Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Portions of this release, particularly the statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Agilysys. Many factors could cause Agilysys' actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include those referenced in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or as may be described from time to time in Agilysys' subsequent SEC filings.
Forward-Looking Language
Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to Agilysys' anticipated revenue gains, sales volume, margin improvements, cost savings, and new product introductions.
Other associated risks include geographic factors, political and economic risks, the actions of Agilysys' competitors, changes in economic or industry conditions or in the markets served by Agilysys, and the ability to appropriately integrate acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures.

Agilysys does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release.

On February 1, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal 2008 third quarter ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 1, 2008
 

 
BOCA RATON, Fla.  February 1, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2008 unaudited third-quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2007.
Third-Quarter Results of Operations
Sales for the third quarter increased 65.1% to $250.1 million, compared with $151.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Organic revenue grew $17.9 million, or 11.8%, compared with last year's third quarter, and represented 18.2% of the sales increase. Revenue from the company's four recent acquisitions contributed $80.7 million, or 81.8% of the sales increase.
Fiscal 2008 third-quarter sales of hardware products were $189.3 million, up 57.8%, compared with $120.0 million for last year's third quarter. Software sales were $25.5 million, up 119.5% from $11.6 million a year ago. Services revenue was $35.3 million, up 77.3% from $19.9 million a year ago.
Gross margin for the third quarter was $57.7 million, or 23.1% of sales, compared with $35.5 million, or 23.4% of sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The slight decline in gross margin percentage was due to the change in customer and product mix in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the third quarter were $55.2 million, or 22.1% of sales, compared with $33.0 million, or 21.8% of sales, in the same quarter a year ago. The $22.2 million increase in SG&A expenses was principally due to incremental operating expenses from the company's recent acquisitions, which contributed $19.1 million, or 86.0% of the increase in expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $8.2 million compared with $1.9 million last year.
Net interest income for the third quarter was $1.4 million compared with $1.0 million in the same period last year. The improvement was due to the company's higher cash position, which was partially offset by a slight decline in the yield earned on the company's short-term investments.
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $1.1 million, or $0.04 per share, compared with $2.5 million, or $0.08 per share, for the third quarter last year. Included in income from continuing operations was a loss of approximately $1.0 million associated with the company's equity investment.
EBITDA was $10.6 million for the current quarter, compared with $4.4 million a year ago. As a result of the March 2007 divestiture of the company's KeyLink Systems distribution business and recent acquisitions, the company believes that EBITDA from continuing operations (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and results of discontinued operations) most accurately reflects the company's performance and provides more meaningful year-over-year comparisons. (NOTE: A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income is provided in the financial tables included in this release. This financial measure of profitability is included to supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in this press
 
release. See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" section in this release for further information.)
Excluding one-time discrete tax items, the effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was 66.4% compared with 20.6% for the third quarter in the prior year. The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate principally because of the effects of losses related to the company's equity investment, tax code limitations on deductibility of meals and entertainment expenses, and compensation associated with incentive stock option awards.
"Operationally, this quarter was very strong, with solid demand across our base business and our newly acquired businesses," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "However, our quarterly financial results reflect lower sales than anticipated due to a significant increase in bill-and-hold sales, which consistent with our revenue recognition policies, will contribute to sales and earnings in subsequent quarters. Additionally, we incurred higher costs in the quarter for unanticipated one-time expenses associated with acquisitions."  
Year-to-Date Results of Operations
For the nine months ended December 31, 2007, sales were $574.6 million, a 61.2% increase compared with sales of $356.5 million for the comparable period last year. Organic growth accounted for $45.5 million, or 20.9%, of the increase in sales, representing a 12.8% increase compared with last year. Incremental sales from the company's recent acquisitions accounted for $172.7 million, or 79.1%. of the increase, representing an increase of 48.4% over the comparable period last year.
Year-to-date sales of hardware products were $427.2 million, up 63.8% from $260.7 million for the first nine months of last year. Software sales were $52.5 million, up 105.9% from $25.5 million a year ago. Services revenue was $95.0 million, up 35.2% from $70.3 million last year.
Gross margin for the nine months was 23.1% of sales, compared with 24.9% in the prior-year period. The decline in gross margin percentage was due to a change in customer and product mix, including acquisitions made in the past year. Approximately 40 basis points of the decline was unanticipated and is due to our increased participation in a more highly competitive storage environment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $139.2 million, or 24.2% of sales, for the year to date, compared with $95.8 million, or 26.9%, in the prior-year nine-month period. The $43.4 million increase in SG&A expense was mainly due to incremental operating expenses from the company's recent acquisitions, which accounted for $37.3 million, or 85.9% of the increase. Depreciation and amortization for the first nine months was $13.3 million compared with $5.9 million for the same period last year.
Income from continuing operations increased $10.2 million year-to-date to $5.2 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a loss of $5.1 million, or a loss of $0.17 per share, for the same period a year ago.
EBITDA for the nine-month period was $6.9 million, an increase of $8.0 million over the prior-year period's loss of $1.1 million.
Recent Acquisitions and Intangible Asset Amortization
Over the past 13 months, the company has recorded total intangible amortization expense of $5.9 million for the third quarter, and $8.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2007.
This quarter's results included the full-quarter contribution of all four acquisitions, which have been integrated into the organization. Visual One Systems  acquired in January 2007 for $14.3 million  is a leading developer of open system software, has been integrated into the Hospitality Solutions business. Agilysys also completed the acquisition of InfoGenesis  acquired in June 2007 for $90.7 million. InfoGenesis is a software developer with the most innovative and scalable point-of-sale product in the hospitality industry. Both of these acquisitions have significantly expanded the company's customer base
 
in the hospitality market and have strengthened its already leading positions in key segments of the hospitality industry.
In April, the company acquired Stack Computer for $26.9 million. Stack, an EMC premier technology integrator and Cisco Advanced Technology Partner, has become the foundation of the company's storage and networking solutions practice. And, in July, Agilysys completed the acquisition of Innovativ Systems Design for $108.6 million. Innovativ is the largest U.S. solution provider of Sun Microsystems server, storage and enterprise storage management products and professional services. All of these acquisitions have established new markets for Agilysys, diversified the company's supplier mix, and broadened its customer base.
Balance Sheet and Treasury Highlights
Cash flow from continuing operations in the attached cash flow statement includes divestiture related charges. Excluding taxes and transaction expenses associated with the divestiture, the company generated $17.7 million in cash flow from operations for the year to date.
Cash and cash equivalents were $138.4 million compared with $604.7 million at March 31, 2007. The decrease in cash was due to acquisitions, repurchase of common stock and tax payments related to the divestiture of KeyLink Systems distribution business. The company has aggressively invested the majority of the divestiture proceeds in strategic acquisitions and recapitalizing the business. The company paid $212.7 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions and $120.5 million for the repurchase of common shares.
As of December 31, 2007, accounts receivable were $224.7 million, an increase of 92.5%, or $108.0 million, compared with $116.7 million at March 31, 2007. Accounts payable of $185.8 million increased 120% from $84.3 million at March 31, 2007. The increases in receivables and payables were due to the overall increase in company sales and the impact of recent acquisitions.
Inventory was $48.2 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $9.9 million at March 31, 2007. Included in inventory is $31.5 million in bill-and-hold inventory. From time to time, the company enters into bill-and-hold sales transactions where the customer has placed an order, and consistent with the customer's requirements, the customer has accepted an invoice with shipment of the product scheduled to occur at a later date. In such instances, revenue and the cost of goods sold are recognized once the product has been shipped to the customer. The cost of goods sold associated with these transactions is included in inventory on the balance sheet until shipped.
Net working capital as a percentage of sales at December 31, 2007 was 5.8%, for the trailing twelve months. This reflects an improvement from 11.0% a year ago, and represents the company's progress toward its goal of keeping working capital at approximately 5% of sales.
Share Repurchases
On September 26, 2007, Agilysys announced the final results of its modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, which expired September 19, 2007. The company accepted for repurchase 4,653,287 shares at a price of $18.50 per share, for a total cost of approximately $86.1 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer.
On December 17, 2007, the company announced it had completed the repurchase of 2,000,000 shares on the open market at a total purchase price of approximately $30.4 million. Also announced on December 17, 2007, Agilysys entered into an additional Rule 10b5-1 plan that enables the repurchase of up to an additional 2,500,000 of the company's common shares. As of January 25, 2008, 1,793,854 common shares have been repurchased for approximately $26.1 million under this plan.
Including the shares repurchased in the self-tender offer, during the past six months the company has
 
repurchased 8.4 million shares or approximately 27 percent of its previously outstanding basic shares. Following these repurchases, approximately 23.1 million shares are outstanding.
Business Outlook
As of the fiscal 2008 third quarter, the company is updating guidance to account for its nine-month performance. As a result, the company is confirming its previously issued guidance for annual sales and gross margin. Annual sales are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $800 million. Full-year gross margin is expected to remain at approximately 23.5% of sales.
However, the company now expects EBITDA margin to be approximately 2.0% of sales. SG&A expenses are anticipated to be approximately $190 million for the full year, including the impact of acquisition- and integration-related costs, stock compensation expense of $6 million, and depreciation and amortization of $18.5 million. Interest income is expected to be approximately $12.5 million and the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 27% for the fiscal year, including the impact of $2.9 million in year-to-date FIN 48 benefits. Based on an estimated 28.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.25 per share.
"Although we are revising EBITDA guidance and are very mindful of maintaining operating efficiencies, we are well ahead of our plans with an $850 million run rate in revenues this year," said Rhein. "Our strong organic sales growth is occurring at the same time we are integrating four newly acquired businesses without impacting our core business. We remain focused on executing our strategic plan, and are on target toward meeting our long-term financial goals."
At the time of the March 2007 KeyLink divestiture, the company established the following long-term financial goals including:
Conference Call Information
A conference call to discuss third-quarter and year-to-date results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Friday, February 1, 2008. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: . A taped replay of the conference call will be available at 2 p.m. ET on Friday, February 1, 2008, through midnight ET on Friday, February 15, 2008, accessible by dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 (passcode #415198).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP in this press release, the company uses the non-GAAP financial measure of EBITDA, defined as net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is further adjusted to remove the results of discontinued operations to arrive at EBITDA from continuing operations.
Management reviews these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the company's performance. Additionally, management believes that such information can enhance investors' understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures within the accompanying table, as required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.
Forward-Looking Language
Portions of this release, particularly the statements made by management and those that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on current
 
assumptions and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Agilysys. Many factors could cause Agilysys actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include those referenced in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or as may be described from time to time in Agilysys subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.
Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to Agilysys long-term financial goals, anticipated revenue gains, sales volume, margin improvements, cost savings, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization, and new product introductions.
Other associated risks include geographic factors, political and economic risks, the actions of Agilysys competitors, changes in economic or industry conditions or in the markets served by Agilysys, and the ability to appropriately integrate and derive performance from acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures.
In addition, this release contains time-sensitive information and reflects management's best analysis only as of the date of this release. Agilysys does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release.

The information provided in Item 2.03 is incorporated by reference herein.
Fourth Amendment to Unsecured Credit Facility
On February 21, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the Fourth Amendment Agreement (the "Fourth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated October 18, 2005 ("Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for loans and letters of credit aggregating to $200 million, including a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit issued by LaSalle Bank National Association or one of its affiliates and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements. A copy of the Credit Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K dated October 21, 2005.
The purpose of the Fourth Amendment, among other things, is to modify certain financial covenants and other terms to reflect the change in the unsecured obligations owing with respect to the Company's Agreement for Inventory Financing. In particular, the Fourth Amendment replaced the definitions of Agreement for Inventory Financing, Consolidated Fixed Charges, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, Excluded Subsidiary, Leverage Ratio, Liquidity Ratio, Material Indebtedness Agreement, and Permitted Foreign Subsidiary Loans and Investments. The Fourth Amendment also provides that the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 1.20 to 1.00, the Company's Leverage Ratio cannot exceed 2.80 to 1.00, and for certain Consolidated Net Worth requirements for the Company. For any fiscal quarter in which the Leverage Ratio equals or exceeds 2.00 to 1.00, a Liquidity Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for such quarter will be applicable as well. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment amended Schedule 3 (Guarantors of Payment) to the Credit Agreement to reflect changes in the Company's domestic guarantors of payment.
The description of the Fourth Amendment set forth in this Item 2.03 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Fourth Amendment, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's next periodic report in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-X.
Agreement for Inventory Financing
On February 22, 2008, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement for Inventory Financing (Unsecured) ("Inventory Financing Agreement") with IBM Credit LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"). In addition to providing the Inventory Financing Agreement, IBM has engaged and may engage as a primary supplier to the Company in the ordinary course of business.
Under the Inventory Financing Agreement, the Company may finance the purchase of products from authorized suppliers up to an aggregate outstanding amount of $145 million. The Lender may, in its sole discretion, temporarily increase the amount of the credit line but in no event shall the amount of the credit line exceed $250 million. No finance charges shall accrue on any outstanding amounts during the free financing period.
The Inventory Financing Agreement shall remain in force until the termination date, the date specified in a written notice by the Company that it intends to terminate the Inventory Financing Agreement which date shall be no less than ninety days following the receipt by the lender of such written notice, or termination by the lender after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, as defined in the Inventory Financing Agreement. The termination date is defined within the Inventory Financing Agreement as the date specified in a written notice of termination, which notice may also constitute a stop funding notice (as defined in the Inventory Financing Agreement), sent by the lender to the Company, which date shall be no earlier than the date sixty days following delivery by lender of such notice of termination or such other date as lender and the Company may agree from time to time in writing.
The Inventory Financing Agreement contains the same affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary as the Credit Facility. The Inventory Financing Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties.
The description of the Inventory Financing Agreement set forth in this Item 2.03 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Inventory Financing Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's next periodic report in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

On April 11, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") announced it amended the original earn-out agreement payable to former shareholders of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc., a Sun Microsystems reseller.
Agilysys acquired Innovativ on July 2, 2007, for $100 million in cash, and additional consideration based on financial performance. As described in the Company's July 6, 2007 Current Report on Form 8-K concerning the acquisition of Innovativ, Agilysys originally agreed to pay an earn-out of two dollars for every dollar of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) greater than $50 million in cumulative EBITDA over the first two years after closing the acquisition. The original agreement limited the maximum earn-out payment to $90 million.
Under the amended agreement, Agilysys will pay $35 million to all shareholders of Innovativ and, as part of this agreement, non-employee shareholders will receive no additional payments. In addition, the maximum total payout under the earn-out is reduced to $58.65 million, inclusive of the $35 million paid now. The EBITDA target required for the remaining employee shareholders to be eligible for an additional payout is now $67.5 million in cumulative EBITDA over the first two years after the close of the acquisition.
The public announcement was made by means of a press release, the text of which is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  April 11, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced it has amended the original earn-out agreement payable to former shareholders of Innovativ Systems Design, Inc., a Sun Microsystems reseller.
Agilysys acquired Innovativ on July 2, 2007, for $100 million in cash, and additional consideration based on financial performance. Originally, Agilysys agreed to pay an earn-out of two dollars for every dollar of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) greater than $50 million in cumulative EBITDA over the first two years after closing the acquisition. The original agreement limited the maximum earn-out payment to $90 million.
Under the amended agreement, Agilysys will pay $35 million to all shareholders of Innovativ and, as part of this agreement, non-employee shareholders will receive no additional payments. In addition, the maximum total payout under the earn-out is reduced to $58.65 million, inclusive of the $35 million paid now. The EBITDA target required for the remaining employee shareholders to be eligible for an additional payout is now $67.5 million in cumulative EBITDA over the first two years after the close of the acquisition.
"I am pleased with the performance of Innovativ and the management team and the progress we've made in integrating Innovativ into the Agilysys organization, including consolidating procurement of Sun Microsystems products under Arrow Electronics," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. Rhein added, "The amended structure enables Agilysys  together with Innovativ employee shareholders  to maximize the value of the Innovativ acquisition by providing greater operating flexibility and reducing the earn-out payments to non-employee shareholders."

Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition; and Item 7.01    Regulation FD Disclosure
On May 13, 2008 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release updating its annual guidance for the year ended March 31, 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla., May 13, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced that its unaudited fiscal 2008 sales will be at the low end of previously stated guidance; however, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA" is operating income plus depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of sales is anticipated to come in below management's previous expectations issued on February 1, 2008.
Agilysys expects unaudited sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 to be approximately $781 million  a 65% increase over fiscal 2007. Previously, the company had estimated fiscal 2008 sales to be in the range of $780 million to $800 million. Unaudited gross margin for fiscal 2008 is expected to be 23.4% of unaudited sales, which is slightly below the company's previous guidance of 23.5%. The company expects adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year to be approximately 1% of unaudited sales, which is an improvement over the prior year, but well below the company's previous guidance of 2%.
"Our quarter-end sales were significantly softer than anticipated," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "With disappointing adjusted EBITDA performance for fiscal 2008 and economy-related reductions in IT spending in the marketplace, we have performed a detailed review of our businesses and have developed an iterative process to reduce expenses and identify opportunities to improve operating efficiencies. As we implement these expense and efficiency measures, we will continue to assess the timing and implementation of our strategic growth strategy, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment. We have re-engaged JPMorgan to assist in this process," Rhein added.
On Thursday, May 29, 2008, Agilysys will hold a conference call to review fiscal 2008 financial results, discuss expense reduction actions and provide fiscal 2009 guidance. The conference call will be broadcast over the Internet at 11 a.m. ET and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: www.agilysys.com.

On June 2, 2008 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
(c)  Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date:  June 2, 2008
 

Exhibit 99.1
BOCA RATON, Fla.  June 2, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2008 unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year results for the period ended March 31, 2008.
Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 74.8% to $206.4 million, compared with $118.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Organic revenue was $114.9 million, or 56.0% of total revenue, and declined 2.8%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the company's acquisitions of Visual One, Stack, InfoGenesis, Innovativ and Eatec (the "Acquisitions") contributed $91.5 million, or 44.0% of revenue in the quarter.
Fourth-Quarter Results of Operations
Fiscal 2008 fourth-quarter revenue from hardware products was $153.8 million, up 75.4%, compared with $87.7 million for last year's fourth quarter. Software revenue was $20.4 million, up 161.5% from $7.8 million a year ago. Services revenue was $32.2 million, up 42.5% from $22.6 million a year ago.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $50.0 million, or 24.2% of revenue, compared with $31.9 million, or 27.0% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. As expected, the gross margin was impacted by changes in product mix, pricing under our procurement agreement with Arrow and by the acquisitions of Innovativ and Stack, which generate lower margins than the company has reported historically. In addition, weaker selling margins experienced in the quarter, and lower rebates in our Technology Solutions Group, which are primarily volume-driven, also contributed to the decline.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter were $60.1 million, or 29.2% of revenue, compared with $37.4 million, or 31.7% of revenue in the same quarter a year ago. Acquisitions accounted for $21.5 million of the $22.7 million increase in SG&A expense. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $10.4 million compared with $2.1 million last year.
Other income for the quarter includes $11.5 million of income recognized from the company's investment in Magirus AG, a privately held enterprise computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany. This income is largely due to the gain on sale of a portion of its business to Avnet in late 2007. Results for Magirus remain unconfirmed and unaudited and are likely to change pending the completion of Magirus' financial statement audit.
Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $0.6 million, compared with $0.7 million a year ago.
Loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $1.0 million, or $0.04 per share, compared with a loss of $6.6 million, or a loss of $0.21 per share, for the fourth quarter last year.
Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $0.3 million, excluding restructuring credits, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $3.4 million, excluding restructuring credits, a year ago. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 results contained a number of large one-time credits, not repeated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. These credits are further described in the Corporate segment of this release. As a result of the March 2007 divestiture of the company's KeyLink Systems Distribution Business and acquisitions, the company believes that adjusted EBITDA most accurately reflects the company's performance and provides more meaningful year-over-year comparisons. (NOTE: A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided in the financial tables included in this release. This financial measure of profitability is included to supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in this press release. See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" section in this release for further information.)

"While fiscal 2008 was an exceptional year strategically as we acquired four companies and materially repositioned Agilysys well ahead of schedule as a diversified large solution provider, tactically we did not meet our earnings objective," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "We saw an unusual slowdown during the last two weeks of March as a number of major customers delayed purchasing decisions."
Revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 64.6% to $781.0 million, compared with $474.6 million in fiscal 2007. Organic revenue increased 9.0% to $516.9 million, and represented 66.2% of revenue. The Acquisitions contributed $264.1 million, or 33.8% of revenue.
Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Fiscal 2008 revenue from hardware products was $581.0 million, up 64.8%, compared with $352.6 million in fiscal 2007. Software revenue was $72.9 million, up 118.9% from $33.3 million a year ago. Services revenue was $127.1 million, up 43.3% from $88.7 million in fiscal 2007.
Gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $182.8 million, or 23.4% of revenue, compared with $120.7 million, or 25.4% of revenue, in fiscal 2007. Gross profit from the Acquisitions was $63.6 million, or 24.1% of revenue. Organic gross profit was $119.2 million, or 23.1% of organic revenue. Changes in product mix, pricing under our procurement agreement with Arrow and margins of our acquisitions all contributed to lower gross margins.
SG&A expenses for fiscal 2008 were $199.3 million, or 25.5% of revenue, compared with $133.2 million, or 28.1% of revenue, in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, SG&A from the Acquisitions was $58.8 million, or 22.3% of revenue. Organic SG&A was $140.5 million, or 27.1% of organic revenue. Depreciation and amortization for the year was $23.7 million compared with $8.7 million a year ago.
For fiscal 2008, the company recorded other income of $11.5 million recognized from the company's investment in Magirus AG, which was partially offset by operating losses of $2.6 million from Magirus, and a gain on sale of $1.3 million on an investment in an affiliated company.
Net interest income for fiscal 2008 was $12.2 million, compared with $2.4 million in 2007.
Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $4.2 million, or $0.15 per share, compared with a loss of $11.6 million, or a loss of $0.38 per share, for fiscal 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA was $7.2 million, excluding restructuring credits, for fiscal 2008 compared with a loss of $3.8 million, excluding restructuring credits, in fiscal 2007.
The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the 12 months ended March 31, 2008 was 42.5%.
The full-year fiscal 2008 results included longer-term investments and unanticipated one-time costs associated with acquisitions. These include the following:
Investments and One-Time Expenses
"We had expected to see more positive results from our Technology Solutions Group investments as we completed fiscal 2008," said Rhein. "These investments along with the unexpectedly soft IT spending environment in our fiscal fourth quarter, contributed to disappointing EBITDA results for the year."
Immediately following the divestiture of the company's KeyLink Systems Distribution Business in March 2007, the continuing operations of the company represented one business segment that provided IT solutions to corporate and public-sector customers. In fiscal 2008, Agilysys developed a structure to support the company's strategic direction.
Segment Reporting
2
 
As a result, the company has been organized into four business segments: Hospitality Solutions Group, Retail Solutions Group, Technology Solutions Group and Corporate. Fiscal 2007 has been recast to include financial results of these segments.
"We are pleased to share additional financial information on our business segments," Rhein said. "This provides our shareholders, analysts and others clearer and more complete information regarding our operations."
The Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) is a leading technology provider to the hospitality industry, offering application software and services that streamline management of operations, property and inventory for customers in the gaming, hotel and resort, cruise lines, food management services, and sports and entertainment markets.
Hospitality Solutions Group
In fiscal 2008, HSG recorded annual revenue of $85.5 million compared with $37.9 million in fiscal 2007. Of the approximately $47.6 million increase in revenue, approximately $41.1 million came from the acquisitions of Visual One, InfoGenesis and Eatec. Organic growth was 17.9%. Pro forma for the timing of these acquisitions, HSG has revenue of approximately $100 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $4.9 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $1.2 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, $4.1 million of the total depreciation and amortization figure came from acquisitions.
Adjusted EBITDA was $9.5 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $6.7 million in fiscal 2007. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.1%, compared with 17.7% in fiscal 2007. The deterioration in adjusted EBITDA margin was largely attributable to the InfoGenesis acquisition, which did not meet the company's expectations for the year, and was less profitable than the existing HSG business last year. The decrease in margin was also the result of one-time costs related to the integration of InfoGenesis and making InfoGenesis software payment card industry ("PCI") compliant.
HSG expensed $2.3 million of development costs for a new property management application, Guest360.

The Retail Solutions Group (RSG) is a leader in designing solutions that help make retailers more productive and provide their customers with an enhanced shopping experience. RSG solutions help improve operational efficiency, technology utilization, customer satisfaction and in-store profitability, including customized pricing, inventory and customer relationship management systems. The group also provides implementation plans and supplies the complete package of hardware needed to operate the systems, including servers, receipt printers, point-of-sale terminals and wireless devices for in-store use by the retailer's store associates.
Retail Solutions Group
In fiscal 2008, RSG recorded annual revenue of $138.1 million, representing an increase of 48.8% compared with $92.8 million in fiscal 2007. Growth was primarily driven by retailers upgrading and enhancing their technology to improve the shopping experience for their customers. All revenue growth for RSG was organic during fiscal 2008.
Depreciation and amortization was $0.4 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $0.5 million in fiscal 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA was $8.0 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $3.1 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.8%, compared with 3.3% in fiscal 2007. The increase in margin was largely attributable to demand for proprietary services and software, as well as resold hardware.

The Technology Solutions Group (TSG) is a leading provider of HP, Sun, IBM and EMC enterprise IT solutions for the complex needs of customers in a variety of industries  including education, finance, government, healthcare and telecommunications, among others. The solutions offered include enterprise architecture and high availability, infrastructure optimization, storage and resource management, identity management and business continuity.
Technology Solutions Group
In fiscal 2008, TSG recorded annual revenue of $557.4 million, an increase of $213.9 million, or 62.3%, compared with $343.5 million in fiscal 2007. A total of $221.5 million, or 39.7% of revenue, resulted from the company's acquisitions of Innovativ and Stack. North American organic revenue grew more than 10% through the first nine months of fiscal 2008, but a significant decline in revenue of 17% in the fourth quarter resulted in an annual growth rate of 1.4%. China revenue decreased 50%, compared with last year. Pro forma for the timing of the acquisitions, TSG has revenue of approximately $620 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $14.6 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $2.1 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in depreciation and amortization relates to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
Adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $17.7 million in fiscal 2007. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.0%, compared with 5.2% in fiscal 2007. While EBITDA margin for TSG was relatively flat compared with last year, it was negatively impacted by pricing pressure, particularly with the EMC product line and substantial longer term investments that did not deliver as anticipated. Those longer-term investments included $3.3 million to build-out storage, networking and server solutions capacity and capabilities; losses of $1.1 million in its China operations; and losses of $3.9 million in its professional services operation.
The company's Corporate segment consists of executive management, the board of directors and shared services of finance, IT, human resources and legal.
Corporate
Depreciation and amortization was $3.9 million in fiscal 2008, down from $4.9 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in depreciation and amortization related to the divestiture of KeyLink.
Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $38.1 million in fiscal 2008, compared with a loss of $28.7 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 included large credits totaling $6.5 million primarily related to reversing a prior restructuring charge, true-ups of bad debt expense, and reversal of previously accrued open price receivers. Corporate cost reductions of $6.1 million subsequent to the divestiture of KeyLink were more than offset by higher costs, including: $2.7 million in facilities expense, $4.2 million in stock and benefits compensation, and $1.8 million in acquisition-related expenses.
"As a result of the uncertain economic environment and correlated deferral of IT expenditures, we have conducted a detailed review of our businesses to identify operating efficiencies and reduce costs," said Rhein. "We have begun to take action and expect to have essentially all of the expenses identified and eliminated by June 30, 2008."
Business Outlook
As part of the company's cost-reduction effort, it expects to eliminate approximately $17 million in SG&A expenses resulting in a pro forma, full-year increase in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 million, or realized improvement in adjusted EBITDA of $10.5 million in fiscal 2009 based on the timing of executing planned cost savings.
The company is anticipating fiscal 2009 annual revenue of $860 million to $900 million Full-year gross margin is expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25.0% for the year.
The company expects SG&A expenses to be approximately $210 million to $213 million in fiscal 2009, excluding restructuring charges. Agilysys expects stock compensation expense of $5.4 million and depreciation and amortization of $27.0 million. Continued investments in the Hospitality Solutions Group's launch of a new property management application, Guest360, will cost approximately $4.1 million, of which $3.1 million is forecast to be expensed.
TM
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $27 million to $40 million.

Given the significant intangible amortization associated with recent acquisitions and based on an estimated 23.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.35 per share.
Capital expenditures are estimated at $8 to $10 million for the year.
A conference call to discuss fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year 2008 results, discuss expense reduction actions and provide fiscal 2009 guidance is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Monday, June 2, 2008. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and a replay will be accessible on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

On June 16, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") filed Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report that it will be unable to timely file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.
As previously announced, Agilysys will recognize its share of equity income, which is expected to be significant, from the company's 20% ownership interest in Magirus AG. This income is largely due to the gain on sale of a portion of Magirus' business to Avnet in late 2007.
Due to the materiality of Magirus to Agilysys' financial statements in fiscal 2008, an independent audit of Magirus AG must be completed before the 2008 Form 10-K can be filed. It is unlikely Agilysys will meet the Form 12b-25 extended timeline based on the estimated time to complete the audit.

Exhibit 99.1
BOCA RATON, Fla.  June 25, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed five independent directors to a special committee created to oversee the company's strategic evaluation process.
Effective immediately, the board also has appointed R. Andrew Cueva to fill a vacancy on the nine-member board following the resignation of director Dr. Curtis J. Crawford, who intended not to stand for re-election at the company's 2008 annual shareholder meeting because of a major scheduling conflict. Due to the recently announced postponement of the annual meeting, Dr. Crawford has decided to depart now.
Cueva, managing director of MAK Capital, the company's largest shareholder, will serve on the special committee. Directors Thomas A. Commes and Howard V. Knicely will co-chair the committee, which will also include Keith M. Kolerus and Robert G. McCreary, III.
"The independent members of the special committee are highly qualified to analyze all of the strategic alternatives available to our company," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "They possess a broad range of business experience and have gained substantial knowledge about Agilysys either as members of the board or as a long-term major shareholder. We are confident of their ability to present prudent recommendations for the full board to consider on behalf of all of Agilysys' stakeholders."
Agilysys intends to disclose developments regarding the strategic evaluation process only if and when the board has approved a specific course of action after receiving the recommendations of JPMorgan, its financial advisor. Agilysys cautions that there can be no assurance that the exploration of alternatives will result in a particular course of action.
Rhein added, "I want to express my personal and the Board's deep gratitude to Curtis Crawford for his valuable insights and dedicated support of our shareholder value-creation agenda, and wish him the very best. At the same time, we welcome the perspective of our largest shareholder, MAK Capital, which owns
 
approximately 18 percent of the company."
Cueva has been a managing director of MAK Capital, a New York-based value-oriented hedge fund, since January 2005. Prior to joining MAK Capital, he was a portfolio manager and analyst at Green Cay Asset Management in the Bahamas from 2002 to 2004 and Avalon Global Asset Management in San Francisco from 1999 to 2002. He began his investing career in 1995 at Deltec Asset Management in New York, and has invested across a range of industries. Prior to Deltec, he worked in mergers and acquisitions groups at the Bankers Trust Company and Samuel Montagu & Co.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  July 9, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS) today announced that, on July 3, 2008, the company received a NASDAQ staff determination letter stating the company's shares are subject to potential delisting. The potential delisting is related to Agilysys' delay in filing its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as required by Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).
The delay in filing the Form 10-K is due to Agilysys waiting on audited financial statements for its investment in a foreign entity. As previously announced on June 2, 2008, in the company's fourth quarter earnings release, Agilysys recorded material other income of $8.9 million during fiscal year 2008 resulting from its 20% ownership interest in Magirus AG, a privately held enterprise computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany. Due to the materiality of Magirus to Agilysys' financial statements in fiscal 2008, Agilysys requires audited confirmation of Magirus income and SEC rules require audited financial statements related to Magirus to be filed with the company's Form 10-K. Agilysys expects to be in a position to file its Form 10-K within 60 days.
Agilysys will submit a request for a hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal NASDAQ's determination. The request for a hearing will automatically stay the delisting of the company's common shares until the Panel makes its decision.

On August 7, 2008 Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing fiscal 2009 unaudited first quarter summary financial information for the period ended June 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
(c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: August 7, 2008
 

Exhibit 99.1
BOCA RATON, Fla.  August 7, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced certain fiscal 2009 unaudited first-quarter summary financial information for the period ended June 30, 2008.
Revenue for the first quarter increased 43.4% to $184.1 million, compared with $128.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Organic revenue was $120.2 million, a decrease of 4.9% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Revenue from the company's acquisitions of Innovativ, InfoGenesis, Eatec and Triangle ("Acquisitions") contributed $63.9 million, or 34.7% of revenue.
First-Quarter Results of Operations
Fiscal 2009 first-quarter revenue from hardware products was $132.4 million, up 45.5%, compared with $91.0 million a year ago. Software revenue was $17.7 million, up 42.7% from $12.4 million a year ago. Services revenue was $34.1 million, up 36.4% from $25.0 million a year ago.
Gross profit for the first quarter was $48.6 million, or 26.4% of revenue, compared with $32.3 million, or 25.2% of revenue, for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase was due to higher selling margins in the company's technology solutions segment and higher proprietary services sales in the quarter compared with the prior-year period.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter were $57.3 million, or 31.1% of revenue, compared with $37.6 million, or 29.3% of revenue, an increase of $19.7 million compared with the prioryear period. Acquisitions accounted for $14.4 million in incremental SG&A expenses. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared with $1.8 million a year ago. Also, included in the fiscal 2009 first quarter was in excess of $0.5 million of unanticipated expense associated with the costs of additional communications with our shareholders and exploring strategic alternatives.
The fiscal 2009 first-quarter results includes a restructuring charge of $23.1 million, of which $2.5 million is related to severance costs associated with the previously announced cost reduction plan, and $20.6 million is related to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with The CTS Corporations, which was acquired in May 2005.
Operating loss for the first quarter was $31.8 million compared with a loss of $5.3 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2008. The increase in operating loss of $26.5 million from fiscal 2008 is attributable to increased gross margin of $16.3 million offset by the restructuring charge of $23.1 million and increased SG&A of $19.7 million.
"Our hospitality and retail solutions businesses continue to perform well in the current economic
1
 
environment," said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "Although weak demand for IT products and services continues, our technology solutions sales were disappointing and did not meet expectations. We saw a number of projects with large customers delayed and we dealt with disruptions caused by the restructuring of the business."
As previously announced on June 2, 2008, in the company's fourth quarter earnings release, Agilysys recorded material other income during fiscal year 2008 resulting from its 20% ownership interest in Magirus AG, a privately held enterprise computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany. Since financial information associated with the company's proportionate share of gains and losses reported by Magirus remain unaudited and unconfirmed, Agilysys is currently unable to complete preparation of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2008.
Magirus
Due to these open accounting matters related solely to the company's minority investment in Magirus, Agilysys is reporting summary financial information which is unaudited. When the audit of Agilysys' share of Magirus' income and losses is complete, the company will file its financial statements for all applicable periods with the SEC.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) recorded revenue of $24.8 million, up 85.1% compared with $13.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. A total of $13.2 million, or 53.2% of revenue, came from the acquisitions of InfoGenesis, Eatec and Triangle, a UK-based reseller and specialist for InfoGenesis products and services, which was acquired in April 2008.
Hospitality Solutions Group
Depreciation and amortization for HSG was $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Included in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $1.0 million of depreciation and amortization attributable to the acquisitions.
Operating income was $1.8 million in the first quarter for HSG, compared with $1.6 million a year ago. Operating income margin was 7.3%, compared with 11.9% a year ago.
Current quarter operating income includes $1.1 million of development costs associated with HSG's development of Guest360, which were $0.8 million higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Guest360 is HSG's next-generation property management solution, and was recognized as Best New Technology' at HITEC 2007. The company plans to complete development and launch Guest360 in fiscal 2010. The product is on target for beta testing this year with a 250-room, upscale property in Tennessee.
TM
Excluding development costs associated with Guest360 operating income would have been $2.9 million, or 11.7% of revenue.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Retail Solutions Group (RSG) recorded revenue of $37.5 million, representing an increase of 84.7% compared with $20.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. RSG had double-digit revenue growth in hardware, software and services.
Retail Solutions Group

Operating income was $3.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $1.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Operating income margin was 10.1%, compared with 5.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Expansion of operating income margin was due to economies of scale and a higher volume of proprietary services.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Technology Solutions Group (TSG) recorded revenue of $121.8 million, up 28.6%, compared with $94.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The company's acquisition of Innovativ contributed $50.7 million to quarterly revenue. Organic revenue declined by almost 25% year-over-year. Continued weak demand for IT products and services, disruptions caused by the restructuring of the business and the purchasing patterns of our largest customers, many of whom this year are deferring large purchases to the back half of the year, resulted in disappointing performance for our Technology Solutions Group.
Technology Solutions Group
Depreciation and amortization for TSG was $4.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in depreciation and amortization is due to intangible amortization associated with the acquisition of Innovativ.
Operating loss was $1.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with operating income of $3.0 million a year ago.
Depreciation and amortization was $1.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Corporate
Operating loss was $36.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Included in operating loss is $1.7 million of stock compensation expense compared with $1.8 million in the prior year. In addition, the company incurred in excess of $0.5 million of unanticipated expense associated with the cost of additional communications with our shareholders and exploring strategic alternatives.
Also reported in the quarter was a restructuring charge of $23.1 million, of which $2.5 million is related to severance costs associated with the company's cost reduction plan, and $20.6 million is related to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of The CTS Corporations. Excluding restructuring charges in the quarter, corporate operating loss would have been $13.2 million compared with a loss of $11.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in corporate segment losses is primarily due to higher employee benefit expenses, professional fees and costs associated with exploring strategic alternatives.
As previously announced in its fourth-quarter earnings release on June 2, 2008, the company conducted a detailed review of its businesses to identify opportunities to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. The majority of the costs eliminated are compensation and other employee-related expenses. As of June 30, 2008, the company had executed on its cost savings plan and expects to realize the benefits starting in the second quarter.
Cost Reductions
The combination of these actions is expected to result in the company meeting its previously announced annual cost reduction goal disclosed on June 2, 2008.

"Given the current uncertain economic environment, we have conducted a review of the prospects for our businesses for this fiscal year. While projects and purchases have been delayed and/or reduced in scope, our customers are not cancelling projects," said Rhein. "Our largest customers still expect to procure product consistent with expectations provided earlier in this fiscal year, with many customers deferring large purchases to the back half of our fiscal year."
Business Outlook
The company expects fiscal 2009 revenue to be between $860 million and $900 million, however, achieving the high end of the range will be more difficult and is largely dependant on TSG customers making purchases consistent with current expectations. Full-year gross margin is still expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25.0%.
The company expects SG&A to be approximately $210 million to $213 million excluding restructuring charges but including stock compensation expense of $5.4 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $27.0 million. The company plans continued investments in the Hospitality Solutions Group's launch of Guest360, which is estimated to cost approximately $4.1 million, of which $3.1 million is forecast to be expensed.
Given the open accounting matters related solely to the company's minority investment in Magirus, it is difficult to provide guidance for earnings from continuing operations at this time. When the audit of Agilysys' share of Magirus income and losses is complete, the company will provide guidance for earnings from continuing operations.
Capital expenditures are estimated to be $8 to $10 million for the year.
The company's continued wide range on guidance reflects the current uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and anticipated demand for TSG products later in the fiscal year. The company will revise guidance as the year unfolds and our customers' IT spending becomes clearer.
A conference call to discuss the first quarter results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, August 7, 2008. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and the call will be archived on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On August 20, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that, on August 14, 2008, the company received a NASDAQ staff determination letter stating the company's common shares are subject to potential delisting. The potential delisting is related to Agilysys' delay in filing its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).
Agilysys has submitted a request for a hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal NASDAQ's determination. The request for a hearing automatically stays the delisting of the company's common shares until the Panel makes its decision.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Date: August 20, 2008
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  August 20, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGYS) today announced that on August 14, 2008, as expected, the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter pursuant to Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) stating that NASDAQ has not received the company's Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008 (the "June Form 10-Q").
This notice was issued in accordance with standard NASDAQ procedures and follows a similar notice received on July 3, 2008 that the Company did not comply with NASDAQ's filing requirement due to the delayed filing of the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 (the "2008 Form 10-K"). The Company plans to present its plan to regain compliance with the filing requirement at an upcoming hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel.
Agilysys will file the June Form 10-Q as soon as it completes the 2008 Form 10-K. As previously announced on June 16, 2008, the delay in filing the 2008 Form 10-K is due to the pending audit of the financial statements of the Company's investment in a foreign entity, Magirus AG, a privately held enterprise computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany in which Agilysys has a 20% ownership interest. When the audit of Agilysys' share of Magirus' income and losses for fiscal 2008 is complete, the Company will file with the SEC its financial statements for all applicable periods.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BOCA RATON, Fla.  October 2, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced revisions to the company's previously announced revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance.
Agilysys now expects fiscal 2009 revenue of approximately $810 million to $825 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million to $24 million, which excludes restructuring charges of $23.8 million related to both the severance costs of its first quarter cost reductions and the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with The CTS Corporations, which was acquired in May 2005. In the company's fourth-quarter earnings release on June 2, 2008, the company stated it expected fiscal 2009 revenue of between $860 million and $900 million with adjusted EBITDA excluding restructuring charges of $27 million to $40 million.
"Previously, our customers had expectations for increased year-over-year spending in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009. As a result of the continued uncertainty on the macro-economic front, we expect capital spending and demand for IT investment to remain soft." said Arthur Rhein, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "With the recent turmoil in the financial and credit markets, our guidance implies a flat to somewhat negative year-over-year second half as we believe projects are more likely to be reduced in scope or delayed."

Exhibit 99.1
Wednesday October 22, 8:30 am ET
Agilysys Announces Leadership Changes, Completes Strategic Alternatives Review
- Arthur Rhein retires as president and CEO, steps down as chairman and director
- Keith Kolerus appointed non-executive chairman; Martin Ellis named president and CEO
- Company to remain independent and realign overhead infrastructure
- Headquarters to be consolidated in suburban Cleveland as part of cost-saving moves
CLEVELAND, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS  News) announced today that its Board of Directors has appointed Keith M. Kolerus, 62, a current Agilysys director and seasoned IT industry executive, as non-executive chairman. Martin F. Ellis, 43, executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, has been appointed as president and chief executive officer of the company and elected to the Board.
Kolerus and Ellis succeed Arthur Rhein, 62, who is retiring as president and chief executive officer and stepping down as chairman and a company director, effective immediately. The company also announced that Kenneth J. Kossin, Jr., 44, vice president and controller, has been elected senior vice president and chief financial officer, and Curtis Stout, 37, currently vice president, business planning and corporate development, will become vice president and treasurer.
In addition, the company announced today that the Board has completed its review of strategic alternatives following a five-month evaluation process conducted in concert with JPMorgan, the company's financial advisors. As a result of this review, the Board has concluded that the best course of action to maximize shareholder value is to remain as an independent company, realign its cost and overhead structure, and drive value creation.
"Given the current turmoil in financial and capital markets, the lack of viable strategic and financial buyers, and the sluggish environment for IT capital spending, the Board and its advisors determined that there is not a meaningful opportunity to monetize intrinsic value through the sale of all or part of the company at this time," said Thomas A. Commes, co-chair of a special committee of the Board. "Accordingly, the decision was reached to expedite and expand the company's overhead cost-reduction initiatives. Our three business groups  Hospitality Solutions Group, Retail Solutions Group and Technology Solutions Group  continue to build outstanding potential for the future, and they will be managed to further improve profitability."
Agilysys announced on June 16, 2008, that its Board of Directors had authorized the company's management and financial advisors to explore a range of strategic and financial alternatives to enhance shareholder value. These alternatives included, but were not limited to, continued implementation of Agilysys' current strategic growth plan, a sale of certain assets or the entire company, formation of joint ventures, and a change to the company's capital structure. The company retained JPMorgan as its financial advisor throughout the evaluation process.
New Leadership Team
Ellis becomes president and chief executive officer of Agilysys after serving five years with the company. He has been a member of Agilysys' senior management team since July 2003, most recently serving as executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer. Prior to joining Agilysys, Ellis was senior vice president and principal at Stern Stewart & Co., a global financial consulting firm, where he managed the Corporate Financial Advisory and Middle Market EVA practice.
 
Kolerus, the new non-executive chairman, has been a director of Agilysys for 10 years. A 40-year industry veteran, he has been a director and officer of a variety of high-tech companies, including the American Division of National Semiconductor (Computer Components) and chairman of the board of directors of National Semiconductor Japan, Ltd.
Ellis and Kolerus will work closely in transitioning through the management restructuring and initial cost-reduction process.
"The Board has consistently been impressed with Martin's strategic leadership skills, and depth and breadth of experience," said Kolerus. "We are convinced that he is the right executive to guide Agilysys and its new management team to a future of outstanding customer service, enhanced performance and shareholder value creation."
Rhein was named president and chief executive officer in April 2002 and was elected chairman effective April 30, 2003. As a member of the management team for more than 20 years, his leadership, strategic vision and personal commitment played key roles in fundamentally reshaping the company's direction and in developing and solidifying its position as a leader in bringing new technology solutions to the marketplace.
"It has been a privilege to serve Agilysys and its shareholders for the past 26 years, and I am confident the company has a bright future," Rhein said. "I have been very fortunate to lead a dedicated, skilled and resilient team of people. Given the current economic environment, it is time for the company to refocus under the very capable leadership of Keith and Martin."
Said Kolerus, "Arthur Rhein contributed many years of expertise and leadership to Agilysys, and has helped to position it for future success. We are grateful for his commitment to the company and its shareholders."
Kossin, who will report to Ellis, has been with Agilysys since 2004. As controller, he has been responsible for the company's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting, technical accounting compliance, Sarbanes Oxley documentation and compliance, internal and external financial reporting and the quarterly and annual auditing process. Prior to joining Agilysys, Kossin was director, general accounting, at Roadway Express, Inc. and corporate controller at Lesco, Inc.
Stout, who also will report to Ellis, has been with Agilysys since 2000. Since joining Agilysys, he has had significant involvement in company acquisitions and divestitures and increasing levels of responsibility in strategically repositioning the company. Stout was promoted to vice president of business planning and corporate development in April, 2007. Prior to joining Agilysys, he spent several years with KeyBank and Cummins Engine Company.
Strategic Realignment Initiatives
The company has set a strategic objective of realigning overhead infrastructure with current market realities. In addition to $17 million of expenses eliminated as a result of cost-reduction initiatives earlier this year, the company has identified further opportunities, including consolidating its headquarters from Boca Raton, Florida, to its existing offices in suburban Cleveland.
"We are committed to taking the actions necessary to improve our operating performance," Ellis said. "These initiatives will make Agilysys a stronger company that is better positioned to thrive in the current uncertain market conditions as well as take advantage of long-term growth opportunities. We have the operating management talent to deliver sustainable earnings growth, and I intend to see that we realize that potential."
The company said additional details will be provided when it reports its second-quarter fiscal 2009 earnings on Thursday, November 20.

Agilysys has eliminated the positions of Robert J. Bailey and Peter J. Coleman, both executive vice presidents, and Jeff Levine, senior vice president  IT and operations, effective immediately.
Three Executive Positions Eliminated
All three previously reported to Arthur Rhein, who retired this week as president and chief executive officer, and stepped down as chairman and a company director. Their corporate positions, based in Boca Raton, Florida and Solon, Ohio, will not be filled as part of the company's plan to more fully integrate their responsibilities into business unit management and consolidate its Florida corporate headquarters into its Solon offices.
 
"As a result of our emphasis on reshaping and streamlining this company, it has become clear that we no longer can afford the corporate overhead that was anticipated to support our previous growth target," said Ellis. "As a result, we are restructuring corporate SG&A to improve operating performance, deliver sustainable earnings growth and position the company for the future."
Agilysys has set a strategic objective of realigning overhead infrastructure with current market realities. In addition to $17 million of expenses eliminated as a result of cost-reduction initiatives earlier this year, the company has identified further opportunities, including a management realignment and headquarters consolidation.
"We greatly appreciate the dedication of Bob, Pete and Jeff, and the many important contributions they have made during their long and distinguished careers with Agilysys," said Ellis. "We wish them well in their future endeavors."
Bailey, who began his career with Agilysys in 1977, was named executive vice president in 2002. He had been a member of the Agilysys Executive Committee since 2000.
Coleman began his career with Agilysys in 1972 and was also named executive vice president in 2002. He had been a member of the Agilysys Executive Committee since 2000.
Levine, who joined Agilysys in 1985, was promoted to senior vice president  IT and operations in 2006.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On November 19, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that, on November 13, 2008, the company received a NASDAQ staff determination letter stating the company's common shares are subject to potential delisting. The potential delisting is related to Agilysys' delay in filing its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).
Agilysys will submit a response to the NASDAQ Listing Qualification Panel by November 20, 2008.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
     (d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND, Nov. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: ), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced that on November 13, as expected, the company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination Letter pursuant to Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) stating that NASDAQ has not received the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2008 (the "September Form 10-Q") and that this serves as an additional basis for delisting the company's shares from The NASDAQ Stock Market.

http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20030915/AGLSLOGO
The company has delayed filing its September Form 10-Q because the company has not yet completed preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 (the "2008 Form 10-K") or its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008 (the "June Form 10-Q"). The company will present to NASDAQ early next week its written plan to regain compliance with the filing requirement.
The delay in filing is related to the pending resolution of the accounting treatment for the company's 20% minority investment in a foreign entity, Magirus AG, a privately held enterprise computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany. Due to these open accounting matters related solely to the company's minority investment in Magirus, Agilysys has been reporting summary financial information, which is unaudited.
The company expects to file its September Form 10-Q as soon as practicable after it files its 2008 Form 10-K and June Form 10-Q.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND  November 20, 2008  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced fiscal 2009 unaudited second-quarter summary financial information for the period ended September 30, 2008.
Second-Quarter Results of Operations
Revenue for the second quarter decreased 11.6% to $170.9 million, compared with $193.3 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Fiscal 2009 second quarter revenue from hardware products was $121.8 million, down 15.4% compared with $144.0 million a year ago. The decrease in hardware sales was primarily due to soft demand for server and storage products. Software revenue was $14.4 million, down 1.4% from $14.6 million a year ago. Services revenue was $34.7 million, unchanged from a year ago.
Gross profit for the second quarter was $50.4 million, or 29.5% of revenue, compared with $42.3 million, or 21.9% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in gross margin was due to higher sales of proprietary software and increased rebates received compared with the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter were $52.8 million, or 30.9% of revenue, compared with $45.6 million, or 23.6% of revenue, in the same quarter a year ago. The $7.2 million increase in SG&A year-over-year was largely due to:
In addition, the company incurred approximately $0.5 million and $1.0 million in expenses related to its recently concluded evaluation of strategic alternatives in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.
 
Consolidated depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $7.0 million compared with $3.6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased intangible amortization.
The operating loss for the quarter, which includes $0.5 million of restructuring charges, was $2.9 million, compared with a loss of $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Operating loss, excluding restructuring charges, plus depreciation and amortization was income of $4.6 million, compared with income of $0.3 million a year ago.
"With our significant management realignment and organizational actions taken in October, I firmly believe we have a turnaround plan in place designed to progressively address our performance shortfalls. We will continue to drive additional operating and cost efficiencies with a concerted focus on enhanced profitability and cash generation. Apart from historical seasonality trends, we are determined to demonstrate sustainable EBITDA improvements going into fiscal 2010," said Martin Ellis, recently named president and chief executive officer. "Our three business groups are very well positioned in their respective markets and continue to build outstanding potential for the future. Given our renewed focus and the current challenges many of our competitors face we are well placed with a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to compete effectively, seize market share and drive shareholder value."
Goodwill and Trademark Impairment
Based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment, recent operating results, and a significant decline in Agilysys' market capitalization, applicable accounting guidance requires the company to perform an interim goodwill and trademark impairment analysis. Accordingly, with the company's current market capitalization below its book value it is compelled to write-off goodwill and trademarks recorded on its balance sheet. As a result the Company expects to record a non-cash write-off of up to $290 million. The company expects to finalize the amount and timing of its goodwill and trademark impairment shortly.
Hospitality Solutions Group
In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) recorded revenue of $23.1 million, down 2.1% compared with $23.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding $1.8 million in revenue from the recent acquisitions of Eatec and Triangle, HSG revenue was $21.3 million. The year-over-year decline is due to lower sales of HSG's legacy property management software. The company is rapidly developing Guest360, HSG's next-generation property management solution that was recognized as "Best New Technology" at the industry's trade show, HITEC 2007. The company plans to complete development and launch Guest360 in fiscal 2010. The product is on target for beta testing this year with a 250-room, upscale property in Tennessee.
Gross margin was $14.9 million, or 64.5% of revenue, compared with $12.7 million, or 53.7% of revenue, in the same period a year ago. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of higher software sales.
Depreciation and amortization for HSG was $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2008.
SG&A increased $2.9 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $1.8 million related to the acquisitions of Eatec and Triangle and $0.6 million of incremental development
 
costs associated with Guest360. Also included in the quarter was incremental bad debt expense of $1.2 million.
Operating income was $0.2 million in the second quarter for HSG, compared with $0.9 million a year ago.
Operating income plus depreciation and amortization was $2.1 million in the second quarter compared with $2.7 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.
Retail Solutions Group
In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Retail Solutions Group (RSG) recorded revenue of $29.9 million, a decrease of 10% compared with $33.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to lower volume of point-of-sale hardware and implementation services in the quarter.
Gross margin was $6.2 million, or 20.8% of revenue, compared with $6.3 million, or 18.9% of revenue in the same period a year ago. The increase in gross margin was due to lower volume of point-of-sale hardware.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $0.1 million, unchanged from a year ago.
Operating income was $0.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $2.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Operating income was down versus the prior-year quarter as a result of increased compensation expense and an increase in bad debt provision of $0.5 million.
Operating income plus depreciation and amortization was $0.8 million in the second quarter compared with $2.1 million in the second quarter a year ago.
Technology Solutions Group
The Technology Solutions Group (TSG) excludes the Hong Kong and China operating results for the current and prior periods as a result of the operations being classified "as held for sale."
In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, TSG recorded revenue of $117.9 million, down 13.6%, compared with $136.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Softness in demand for IT products was broad-based, but was partially offset by higher sales of Sun products.
Gross margin was $28.7 million, or 24.3% of revenue, compared with $23.4 million, or 17.2% of revenue, in the same period a year ago. The increase in gross margin is due to favorable product mix and higher rebates.
Depreciation and amortization for TSG was $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $0.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Operating income was $7.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with operating income of $3.7 million a year ago. The increase was due to year-over-year higher selling margin and rebates along with lower compensation costs due to cost cutting executed in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, including restructuring of the unit's professional services go-to-market strategy. During the second quarter, TSG consolidated its professional services management and delivery groups and will continue selling specific proprietary professional services, including identity management, security and storage virtualization.
 
Operating income plus depreciation and amortization was $11.6 million, or 9.8% of revenue, in the second quarter compared with $4.5 million, or 3.3% of revenue, in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.
Corporate
Operating expenses were $11.9 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2009, compared with $10.2 million in the same period for fiscal 2008. The increase in corporate operating expenses was due to defined benefit retirement plans of $1.0 million, restructuring costs of $0.5 million, and higher professional fees of $0.3 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with $1.0 million a year ago. Stock compensation cost was $0.4 million compared with $1.4 million in the prior year.
Operating loss was $11.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with an operating loss of $10.1 million a year ago.
Six-Month Results of Operations
For the six months ended September 30, 2008, revenue was $350.9 million, a 10% increase compared with revenue of $318.9 million for the comparable period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to incremental revenue from acquisitions of $64.4 million, offset by decline in organic revenue of $32.4 million. The decline in organic revenue was primarily due to soft demand for server and storage related products.
First-half hardware products revenue was $250.1 million, up 7.7% from $232.2 million in the first half last year. Software revenue was $32.1 million, up 18.9% from $27.0 million a year ago. Services revenue was $68.7 million, up 15.1% from $59.7 million in last year's first six months.
Gross profit for the first six months was $98.4 million, or 28.0% of revenue, compared with $74.3 million, or 23.3% of sales, in the prior year. The increase was due to a higher mix of software and services revenue as well as higher rebates.
SG&A was $109.3 million, or 31.1% of revenue, in the first half compared with $82.5 million, or 25.9% of sales, in the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed $16.1 million to the increase in SG&A. The provision for bad debt expense increased $1.2 million over the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, compensation expense increased $1.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher fringe costs.
Depreciation and amortization was $14.0 million up from $5.3 million a year ago. The increase was due to incremental intangible amortization associated with recent acquisitions.
Operating loss was $11.0 million, excluding $23.6 million of restructuring charges, compared with operating loss of $8.3 million for the same period a year ago.
Operating loss, excluding restructuring charges, plus depreciation and amortization was income of $3.0 million, compared with a loss of $3.0 million a year ago.
 
Liquidity
As of September 30, 2008, Agilysys had cash on hand of $57.5 million, an increase of $28.0 million over cash of $29.5 million reported in the first quarter. The increase in cash was primarily due to a $3.6 million tax refund, a $7.3 million dividend from Magirus, AG and approximately $22 million in improved cash flow from operations and the impact of changes in floor plan financing.
As of October 31, 2008, the company had $85.7 million in cash on hand. The increase from September to October is primarily due to strong receivables collection. "We are acutely focused on cash generation in today's challenging markets," Ellis said. "While we're pleased with the overall improvement in cash on hand in October, ongoing cash balances will vary from month to month due to timing of receipts and payments."
As of November 19, 2008, approximately $18 million of the company's cash was invested with The Reserve Fund's Primary Fund, a money market account that is currently not permitting withdrawals. As has been widely reported, the Primary Fund is working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to liquidate the fund; however, the timing of the liquidation is uncertain at this time.
The company remains debt-free. As of October 17, 2008, the company's ability to borrow under its credit facility was suspended due to the company's previously announced failure to timely file its 10-K annual report with the SEC due to audit issues relating to Magirus. The company is working with members of its bank group to explore an alternative financing arrangement.
Magirus
On October 21, 2008, Agilysys signed an agreement to sell its 20% ownership in Magirus AG, a privately held computer systems distributor headquartered in Germany, to Magirus for 1.8 million. Agilysys completed the sale on November 18, 2008 and received $2.2 million.
In 2000, Agilysys invested $10.6 million in Magirus to acquire a 20% ownership stake. As of April 1, 2007, the book value of this investment was $7.8 million. From the initial investment through March 31, 2008 the company earned $4.8 million in marketing fees and dividends. In July 2008, the company received a dividend of $7.3 million. Including the approximately $2.2 million received from the sale of Magirus shares, Agilysys has received a total of $14.3 million in return for its investment in Magirus, resulting in a total return of $3.7 million or 35% on the original investment.
Fiscal 2008
Form 10-K
Filing Update
As previously announced on August 7, 2008, in the company's fiscal 2009 first quarter earnings release, Agilysys recorded material other income during fiscal year 2008 resulting from its ownership interest in Magirus. Since financial information associated with the company's proportionate share of gains and losses reported by Magirus remained unaudited and unconfirmed, Agilysys was unable to complete preparation of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2008.
With the divestiture of the investment in Magirus, Agilysys will now be able to complete its audit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and advance the company's efforts to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, from April 1, 2008 through November 19, 2008, Agilysys has adopted the cost accounting treatment for its investment in Magirus and, as a result, no longer records its proportionate share of Magirus' profits and losses.
 
Due to the open accounting matters related solely to the company's investment in Magirus, Agilysys has been reporting summary financial information, which is unaudited.
Asian Operations
The company is currently exploring divestiture opportunities for its Hong Kong and China operations. Agilysys acquired the Hong Kong and China businesses of TSG in December 2005. The assets and liabilities of for these operations are currently recorded as "held for sale" on the company's balance sheet.
Management Reorganization
As previously announced on October 22, 2008, Arthur Rhein has retired as president and CEO of Agilysys and stepped down as chairman and director. Ellis, formerly executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer, was elected president and CEO, succeeding Rhein. He also was elected to the Board to fill the vacancy created by Rhein's retirement. Keith M. Kolerus, a current Agilysys director, was appointed non-executive chairman and Kenneth J. Kossin, Jr., vice president and controller, was elected senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Kolerus has been a director of Agilysys for 10 years. A 40-year industry veteran, he has been a director and officer of a variety of high-tech companies, including the American Division of National Semiconductor (Computer Components) and chairman of the board of directors of National Semiconductor Japan, Ltd.
On October 23, 2008, the company announced a new operational leadership team and the elimination of a layer of senior management. As part of this strategic realignment, the leaders of the company's three operating segments  Hospitality Solutions Group, Retail Solutions Group, and Technology Solutions Group  now report directly to Ellis.
Cost-Savings Actions to Date
As previously announced in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release on June 2, 2008, Agilysys implemented a cost-savings program that resulted in full-year net expense reduction of approximately $14 million. As a result of the company's management reorganization in October, the company realized $8 million in additional pro forma, full-year cost-savings, resulting in total cost savings to date of approximately $22 million. The $22 million in cost-savings actions taken to date consists of:
The company expects to report a restructuring charge of approximately $8.9 million associated with the reorganization executed in the third quarter.
"The realignment of our expense structure provides for a more efficient and streamlined organization that capitalizes on the experience of our business unit leaders," Ellis said. "It has allowed us to better match our expenses to our current and projected revenue level, given the backdrop of the tough industry and macroeconomic trends."
 
Business Outlook
As previously announced on October 2, 2008, the company revised its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2009. Agilysys had expected revenue of between approximately $810 million and $825 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million to $24 million, which excludes restructuring charges of $23.8 million associated with severance costs of its first-quarter cost reductions and the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the CTS Corporations, which was acquired in May 2005.
However, due to unprecedented uncertainty in the macro economic environment, the company noted that visibility into demand for the quarters ahead is much more limited than normal. As a result, the company is suspending revenue guidance until conditions stabilize. Further, the company has revised its adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million, which excludes restructuring charges and any acquisition-related goodwill impairment. The company expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of:
The company expects cash on hand at March 31, 2009 of between $60 million and $70 million.
"The macro economic environment remains challenging and with limited visibility, into demand for products and services. However, we are fully committed to ensuring that we remain profitable in this difficult economic environment," Ellis said. "We remain focused on generating cash, increasing our adjusted EBITDA and progressively driving operating efficiencies while leveraging our distinctive product and service offerings. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is our best estimate of profitability based on our current forecast and the items we control."
Conference Call Information
A conference call to discuss the second quarter results is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on November 20, 2008. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet and the call will be archived on the investor relations page of the company's Web site: .

     This Amendment No. 1 to the Form 8-K originally filed on November 19, 2008, is being filed to (a) clarify the description of the basis for the target incentive for the individuals whose compensation was described in Item 5.02, and (b) correct an error in the date of grant and the price of the options to purchase common shares for Mr. Kenneth J. Kossin, Jr., also described in Item 5.02.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On November 14, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") approved changes in compensation for Martin F. Ellis, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Kenneth J. Kossin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. These compensation changes are effective as of October 20, 2008, the date upon which Messrs. Ellis and Kossin were elected to their new positions with the Company.
     For Mr. Ellis, the Board approved a base salary of $450,000 and a target incentive of $337,500. The actual amount of Mr. Ellis' incentive compensation will be determined based upon certain subjective measures established by the Compensation Committee of the Board on August 1, 2008. Furthermore, pursuant to the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the Board granted Mr. Ellis 150,000 options to purchase the Company's common shares at $2.19 per share (the closing market price for the Company's common shares on November 14, 2008). One third of such options vests on each of March 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011. The Company has not entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Ellis at this time. Mr. Ellis remains subject to a Change of Control Agreement, executed on June 30, 2003, as amended on May 31, 2005, and a Non-Competition Agreement executed on May 31, 2005, as amended in May 2007 and October 2008.
     For Mr. Kossin, the Board approved a base salary of $285,000 and a target incentive of $142,500. The actual amount of Mr. Kossin's incentive compensation will be determined as noted above for Mr. Ellis. Furthermore, the Board granted Mr. Kossin 45,000 options to purchase the Company's common shares at $2.51 per share (the closing market price for the Company's common shares on November 13, 2008). One third of such options vests on each of March 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Mr. Kossin's employment is subject to the terms of an Employment Agreement, effective April 1, 2007 (the "Kossin Employment Agreement"). The Kossin Employment Agreement was attached to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 19, 2008, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On December 31, 2008, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amendment to Change of Control Agreement and Non-Competition Agreement with Martin F. Ells, President and CEO (the "Ellis Amendment"), and an Amendment to Change of Control Agreement and Non-Competition Agreement with Richard A. Sayers, II, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer (the "Sayers Amendment").
     Mr. Ellis' Change of Control Agreement was originally executed on June 30, 2003, and amended in April 2005 and October 2008, and the Non-Competition Agreement was originally executed on May 31, 2005, and amended in May 2007 and October 2008. Each of Mr. Sayers' Non-Competition Agreement and Change of Control Agreement with the Company was effective as of February 25, 2000, and was subsequently amended in 2003, April 2007 and October 2008. Mr. Ellis' Non-Competition Agreement was included as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed June 6, 2005. Mr. Ellis' Change of Control Agreement was included as Exhibit 10(hh) to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2004, with a single amendment to Mr. Ellis' Change of Control Agreement included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed June 6, 2005. The Non-Competition Agreement and Change of Control Agreement with Mr. Sayers were each included as Exhibit 10(ee) and 10(dd), respectively, to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2006, and a single amendment to both of Mr. Sayers' agreements was incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10(ff) to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2006.
     The Ellis Amendment and the Sayers Amendment modified the severance payment terms of the respective Non-Competition Agreements and the Change of Control Agreements to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enable Messrs. Ellis and Sayers to avoid certain negative tax consequences that might otherwise be triggered by our payment of either benefit to them. Under both the Ellis Amendment and the Sayers Amendment, the Company modified the payment structure of the severance payments and the change of control payments to be the same. In the case either benefit payment is triggered, subject to a six-month delay if necessary to comply with Section 409A, the Company will make payments on regularly scheduled intervals for one year after termination and, within thirty days after the one year anniversary of the termination date, the Company will pay the remainder of the total amount owed in a lump sum.
     The Ellis Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. The description of the Ellis Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Ellis Amendment filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
     The Sayers Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated by reference herein. The description of the Sayers Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Sayers Amendment filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.1
December 31, 2008
     THIS AMENDMENT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT ("Amendment") by and between Agilysys, Inc., formerly known as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and Martin F. Ellis (the "Employee"), is effective as of the execution date below.
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee are parties to a Change of Control Agreement dated as of June 30, 2003, as subsequently amended (the "Change of Control Agreement"); and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee are parties to a Non-Competition Agreement dated as of April 28, 2005, as subsequently amended (the "Non-Competition Agreement"); and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee desire that certain modifications be made to the Change of Control Agreement and Non-Competition Agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and
     WHEREAS, Section 8(c) of the Change of Control Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement permit the parties thereto to amend such agreements in a writing signed by each party.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the parties' mutual desire to modify the Change of Control Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement, the parties agree as follows effective as of the date of execution of this Amendment:
     1. For purposes of this Part I, references to the "Agreements" shall refer to the Change of Control Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement, collectively. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Part I shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Change of Control Agreement or Non-Competition Agreement, as applicable.
     2. The Agreements are hereby amended by providing that all references to "termination of employment" or forms and derivations thereof shall refer to events which constitute a "separation from service" as defined under and for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
     3. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the "severance payments" (as defined in Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement) and the payments under Section 3.1 of the Change of Control Agreement (collectively, such payments under the Agreements will be referred to as the "Severance Payments"), are intended to constitute the right to a series of separate payments. If possible, any Severance Payments made during the first six months following Employee's termination of employment without cause from the Company under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement or following Employee's termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason under Section 3.1 of the
 
Change of Control Agreement are intended to fit into the "separation pay due to involuntary separation from service" exception under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), subject to any limits contained therein, or the "short-term deferral" exception under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), if applicable.
     4. It is the intention of the Company and Employee that the provision of the auto allowance and benefit coverage as severance payments in Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement or the health insurance and retirement benefits in Section 3.1(d) in the Change of Control Agreement fit into exemptions from Section 409A of the Code or otherwise comply with Section 409A of the Code, including, but not limited to, the following:
     Reimbursements paid or in-kind benefits provided for the 24 months following Employee's termination will be paid in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v); provided, however, that from the end of the period during which Employee would be entitled to medical expense reimbursements under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B) through the end of the 24-month severance payment period, any reimbursements provided for medical expenses under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement or Section 3.1(d) under the Change of Control Agreement will be paid at the same time as payments are made for active employees of the Company and, in any event, will be paid no later than the end of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expense was incurred. The amounts eligible for reimbursement or the in-kind benefits provided regarding such medical expenses during any one taxable year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.
     5. If at the time of Employee's termination of employment, he is a "specified employee" of the Company as defined in and pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, then any of the Severance Payments not fitting into an exemption described in Sections 3 or 4 above are required to be delayed for a period of six months following his termination of employment (the "six-month period"). As such, the payment of any cash amounts due under the Agreement during the first six months following Employee's termination date will be accumulated, held and distributed to Employee on the first payroll payment date of the Company following the end of such six-month period (or, if earlier, no later than 30 days following the date of Employee's death). During the six-month period, any amounts which Employee would normally submit for reimbursement by the Company may not be reimbursed. Any amounts for such reimbursements that accumulate during the six-month period will be paid in a lump sum to Employee on the first payroll payment date of the Company following the end of such six-month period (or, if earlier, no later than 30 days following the date of Employee's death). After the six-month period, the Severance Payments due will be paid in accordance with the terms specified in the Agreements as amended in this Amendment.
     6. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any reimbursements subject to Section 409A of the Code provided under the Agreements, shall be made no later than the end of Employee's taxable year following the Employee's taxable year in which such expense was incurred; in addition, such amounts eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any one taxable year under the Agreements may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year under the Agreements.
     7. The parties intend that the Agreements be, at all relevant times, in compliance with (or exempt from) Section 409A of the Code and all other applicable laws, and this Agreement shall be so interpreted and administered. The Company and its affiliates shall have no responsibility for tax or legal consequences to Employee (or Employee's beneficiaries) resulting from the terms or operation of this
 
Amendment or the Agreement (other than as explicitly stated in the Agreement) and shall have no responsibility or obligation for any tax gross-up relating to Section 409A of the Code.
     8. Utilizing the transition relief afforded under Section 409A of the Code, including under IRS Notice 2007-86, the Company and Employee agree that the Severance Payments will be paid as set forth in this Amendment. In accordance with the Section 409A of the Code transition relief, this transition election does not shift amounts owed under the Agreements (or any aggregated arrangement) into or out of 2008.
     1. Part II of this Amendment shall amend the terms of the Change of Control Agreement as set forth herein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Part II shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Change of Control Agreement.
     2. The Change of Control Agreement is hereby amended by the deletion of subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 3.1 and the substitution in lieu thereof of the following:
     "(a) for the one year period from the date of such termination of employment, the Company shall pay to the Employee:
     (i) the greater of the Employee's (x) highest monthly base salary paid or payable by the Company during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Effective Date, or (y) the highest monthly salary paid or payable by the Company at any time from the ninety (90) day period preceding the Effective Date through the date of termination (the "Highest Base Salary") in accordance with its then current payroll practice for paying executive officers;
     (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") target bonus applicable to the Employee at the time of termination ("Target Annual Bonus") payable in equal monthly amounts; and
     (iii) the monthly amount paid or payable to the Employee by the Company as an auto allowance as in effect immediately preceding the Effective Date ("Monthly Auto Allowance"); and
     (b) Within thirty (30) days following the date which is one (1) year from the date of such termination of employment, the Company shall pay to the Employee, in a single sum, an amount equal to the sum of (i) a lump sum amount equal to twelve (12) times his Highest Base Salary plus (ii) his Target Annual Bonus, plus (iii) a lump sum amount equal to twelve (12) times his Monthly Auto Allowance; and
     (c)
[Reserved]
     3. With respect to any payments that the Company promises to pay under Section 3.1(f) relating to an excise tax gross-up (that also constitute a "tax gross up payment" as defined under Section 409A of the Code), such payment shall be made by the Company to Employee no later than the end of
 
Employee's taxable year next following Employee's taxable year in which Employee remits the related taxes.
     1. Part III of this Amendment shall amend the Non-Competition Agreement as set forth herein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Part III shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Non-Competition Agreement.
     2. Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be deleted, and the following shall be inserted therefor:
     "3. . Employee may terminate this Agreement at any time and such termination shall be effective on the date of his or her notice, unless otherwise mutually agreed. Similarly, the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment at any time, with or without advance notice or cause. Should the Company terminate the Employee's employment without cause:
Duration
     (a) for the one year period from the date of such termination of employment, the Company shall pay to the Employee:
     (i) the Employee's monthly base salary paid or payable by the Company in effect on the date of his termination of employment ("Monthly Base Salary") in accordance with its then current payroll practice for paying executive officers;
     (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") target bonus applicable to the Employee at the time of his termination of employment ("Target Annual Bonus") payable in equal monthly amounts; and
     (iii) the monthly amount paid or payable to the Employee by the Company as an auto allowance as in effect on the date of his termination of employment ("Monthly Auto Allowance"); and
     (b) Within thirty (30) days following the date which is one (1) year from the date of such termination of employment, the Company shall pay the Employee, in a single sum, an amount equal to the sum of (i) a lump sum amount equal to twelve (12) times his Monthly Base Salary plus (ii) his Target Annual Bonus, plus (iii) a lump sum amount equal to twelve (12) times his Monthly Auto Allowance; and
     (c) For the twenty-four months after his termination of employment, the Company shall pay for the benefit coverage in effect on the date of his termination of employment.
The amounts in (a), (b) and (c) are the Employee's severance payments (severance payments') hereunder.
 
In the event that (1) Employee's employment is terminated for cause or (2) Employee voluntarily resigns from employment with the Company, then the Company shall have no obligation for severance payments under this provision. Absolutely no one except the Board or an authorized committee of the Board may change this at will' relationship, and then only in writing. Employee acknowledges that any reliance on any representations, oral or otherwise, contrary to at will' employment is unreasonable and shall not form the basis for any actions or forbearances on his or her part."
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment to Change of Control Agreement and Non-Competition Agreement as of the date below written.
Dated: December 31, 2008

Exhibit 10.2

     3.

If possible, any Severance Payments made during the first six months following Employee's termination of employment
 
without cause from the Company under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement or following Employee's termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason under Section 3.1 of the Change of Control Agreement are intended to fit into the "separation pay due to involuntary separation from service" exception under Treas.

     4. It is the intention of the Company and Employee that the provision of the auto allowance and benefit coverage as severance payments in Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement or the health insurance and retirement benefits in Section 3.1(d) in the Change of Control Agreement fit into exemptions from Section 409A of the Code or otherwise comply with Section 409A of the Code, including, but not limited to, the following:

The amounts eligible for reimbursement or the in-kind benefits provided regarding such medical expenses during any one taxable year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     As of January 20, 2009, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") terminated its five-year $200 million unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), with Bank of America, N.A. (as successor to LaSalle Bank National Association), as lead arranger, book runner and administrative agent, and certain other lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility included a $20 million sub-facility for letters of credit issued by Bank of America, N.A., or one of its affiliates and a $20 million sub-facility for swingline loans, which are short-term loans generally used for working capital requirements. The Credit Facility was available to the Company for refinancing existing debt, providing for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes of the Company, including acquisitions. As of October 17, 2008, the company's ability to borrow under its credit facility was suspended due to the Company's failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for March 31, 2008. The Company had not borrowed under the Credit Facility since it was entered into in October of 2005. To avoid fees associated with the credit facility, the Company decided to terminate the facility. There are no material penalties associated with early termination of the Credit Facility.
     The description of the Credit Facility set forth in this Item 1.02 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Facility, which was included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 21, 2005, the Second Amendment to the Credit Facility, which was included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 21, 2007, the Third Amendment to the Credit Facility, which was included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 13, 2007, and the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Facility, which was included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2008.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, March 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced that it has reached an agreement with Ramius LLC and its affiliates ("Ramius") relating to the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for March 26, 2009. The Agilysys Board of Directors believes this settlement is in the best interests of shareholders because it allows the company to avoid the continuing distraction and cost of a proxy contest. Ramius holds approximately 13% of the company's outstanding shares. Prior to reaching the agreement, Ramius had nominated its own slate of three directors for election at the company's 2008 annual meeting.
As part of the settlement agreement, the Agilysys Board appointed John Mutch and Steve Tepedino, both of whom were nominated by Ramius, to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of Charles F. Christ and Eileen Rudden from the Board. The company agreed to nominate and support Mutch and Tepedino for re-election at the company's 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. Ramius agreed to support the company's slate of directors for the 2008 and 2009 annual meetings. The company agreed that it will not expand its Board beyond its current size of nine directors.
"We are pleased to announce this resolution and look forward to having John Mutch and Steve Tepedino join the Board as we continue to focus our full attention and resources on driving improved profitability and long-term value for our shareholders," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys. "I also want to thank Charlie and Eileen for their outstanding contributions and long-standing dedication as members of our Board."
"We believe the addition of John Mutch and Steve Tepedino will add valuable experience to the Board to help drive positive change and improved financial performance for the benefit of all Agilysys shareholders. We are grateful to have reached this settlement in cooperation with Agilysys and look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue," said Mark R. Mitchell, a Partner of Ramius LLC.
The agreement also provides that Ramius will abide by certain standstill provisions through the period ending 10 business days prior to the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for the company's 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The complete agreement between Agilysys and Ramius will be included as an exhibit to Agilysys' Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC.
Mutch (age 52) is the founder and a Managing Partner of MV Advisors, LLC, a firm that provides focused investment and strategic guidance to small- and mid-cap technology companies. In March 2003, Mutch was appointed to the Board of Directors of Peregrine Systems Inc.

Mutch served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Peregrine from August 2003 to December 2005 through its acquisition by Hewlett-Packard. Mutch is currently a director of Edgar Online, Inc., Adaptec, Inc. and Aspyra, Inc.

ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     The Company executed a Loan and Security Agreement dated May 5, 2009 (the "Credit Facility") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for the lenders from time to time party thereto ("Agent"). The Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by the Borrower's assets (as defined in the Credit Facility). This Credit Facility replaces the Company's previous credit facility, which was terminated on January 20, 2009. The Company also terminated its floor plan financing facility on May 4, 2009, and will primarily fund working capital through open accounts payable provided by its trade vendors.
     The Credit Facility provides $50 million of credit (which may be increased by an accordion provision in the Credit Facility up to an additional $25 million) for borrowings and letters of credit and will mature May 5, 2012. The Credit Facility establishes a borrowing base for availability of loans predicated on the level of the Company's accounts receivable meeting banking industry criteria. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of all borrowings, to the extent not previously repaid, is repayable on the Termination Date (as defined). Borrowings also are repayable at such other earlier times as may be required under or permitted by the terms of the Credit Facility. LIBOR Loans (as defined) bear interest at LIBOR (as defined) for the applicable interest period plus an applicable margin. Base rate loans (as defined) bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined) plus an applicable margin. Interest is payable on the first of each month in arrears. There is no premium or penalty for prepayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility.
     The Credit Facility contains mandatory repayment provisions, representations, and warranties and covenants for a secured credit facility of this type. The Credit Facility also contains customary Events of Default upon the occurrence of which, among other remedies, the Lenders may terminate their commitments and accelerate the maturity of indebtedness and other obligations under the Credit Facility.
     The foregoing is a summary of the terms and conditions of the Credit Facility and does not purport to be a complete discussion of that document. A copy of the Loan and Security Agreement executed on May 5, 2009 between the Company and Bank of America, N.A. is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Commitments
          2.1.1. . Each Lender agrees, severally on a Pro Rata basis up to its Commitment, on the terms set forth herein, to make Loans to Borrowers from time to time through the Commitment Termination Date. The Loans may be repaid and reborrowed as provided herein. In no event shall Lenders have any obligation to honor a request for a Loan if the unpaid balance of Loans outstanding at such time (including the requested Loan) would exceed the Borrowing Base.
Loans
          2.1.2. . The Loans made by each Lender and interest accruing thereon shall be evidenced by the records of Agent and such Lender. At the request of any Lender, Borrowers shall deliver a Note to such Lender.
Notes
          2.1.3. . The proceeds of Loans shall be used by Borrowers solely (a) to satisfy existing Debt; (b) to pay fees and transaction expenses associated with the closing of this credit facility; (c) to pay Obligations in accordance with this Agreement; or (d) for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes of Borrowers.
Use of Proceeds
          2.1.4. .
Voluntary Reduction or Termination of Commitments
          (a) The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Upon at least 30 days prior written notice to Agent at any time after the first Loan Year, Borrowers may, at their option, terminate the Commitments and this credit facility. Any notice of termination given by Borrowers shall be irrevocable. On the Commitment Termination Date, Borrowers shall make Full Payment of all Obligations.
          (b) Borrowers may permanently reduce the Commitments, on a Pro Rata basis for each Lender, upon at least 10 days prior written notice to Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of the reduction and shall be irrevocable once given. Each reduction shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, or an increment of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
          2.1.5. . If the aggregate Loans exceed the Borrowing Base ("") or the aggregate Commitments at any time, the excess amount shall be payable by Borrowers by Agent, but all such Loans shall nevertheless constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral and entitled to all benefits of the Loan Documents. Unless its authority has been revoked in writing by Required Lenders, Agent may require Lenders to honor requests for Overadvance Loans and to forbear from requiring Borrowers to cure an Overadvance, (a) when no other Event of Default is known to Agent, as long as (i) the Overadvance does not continue for more than 30 consecutive days (and no Overadvance may exist for at least five consecutive days thereafter before further Overadvance Loans are required), and (ii) the Overadvance is not known by Agent to exceed 5.0% of the Borrowing Base; and (b) regardless of whether an Event of Default exists, if Agent discovers an Overadvance not previously known

Overadvance

by it to exist, as long as from the date of such discovery the Overadvance (i) is not increased by more than $1,000,000, and (ii) does not continue for more than 30 consecutive days. In no event shall Overadvance Loans be required that would cause the outstanding Loans and LC Obligations to exceed the aggregate Commitments. Any funding of an Overadvance Loan or sufferance of an Overadvance shall not constitute a waiver by Agent or Lenders of the Event of Default caused thereby. In no event shall any Borrower or other Obligor be deemed a beneficiary of this Section nor authorized to enforce any of its terms.
          2.1.6. . Without regard to the aggregate Commitments, Agent shall be authorized, in its discretion, at any time that any conditions in are not satisfied, to make Base Rate Loans ("") (a) up to an aggregate amount of $2,500,000 outstanding at any time, if Agent deems such Loans necessary or desirable to preserve or protect Collateral, or to enhance the collectibility or repayment of Obligations; or (b) to pay any other amounts chargeable to Obligors under any Loan Documents, including costs, fees and expenses. Each Lender shall participate in each Protective Advance on a Pro Rata basis. Required Lenders may at any time revoke Agent's authority to make further Protective Advances by written notice to Agent. Absent such revocation, Agent's determination that funding of a Protective Advance is appropriate shall be conclusive.

Letter of Credit Facility
.
          2.3.1. . Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit from time to time until 30 days prior to the Termination Date (or until the Commitment Termination Date, if earlier), on the terms set forth herein, including the following:
Issuance of Letters of Credit
          (a) Each Borrower acknowledges that Issuing Bank's willingness to issue any Letter of Credit is conditioned upon Issuing Bank's receipt of a LC Application with respect to the requested Letter of Credit, as well as such other instruments and agreements as Issuing Bank may customarily require for issuance of a letter of credit of similar type and amount. Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit unless (i) Issuing Bank receives a LC Request and LC Application at least three Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance; (ii) each LC Condition is satisfied; and (iii) if a Defaulting Lender exists, such Lender or Borrowers have entered into arrangements satisfactory to Agent and Issuing Bank to eliminate any funding risk associated with the Defaulting Lender. If Issuing Bank receives written notice from a Lender at least five Business Days before issuance of a Letter of Credit that any LC Condition has not been satisfied, Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue the requested Letter of Credit (or any other) until such notice is withdrawn in writing by that Lender or until Required Lenders have waived such condition in accordance with this Agreement. Prior to receipt of any such notice, Issuing Bank shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any failure of LC Conditions.
 
          (b) Letters of Credit may be requested by a Borrower only (i) to support obligations of such Borrower incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; or (ii) for other purposes as Agent and Lenders may approve from time to time in writing. The renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit shall be treated as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit, except that delivery of a new LC Application shall be required at the discretion of Issuing Bank.
          (c) Borrowers assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuses of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary. In connection with issuance of any Letter of Credit, none of Agent, Issuing Bank or any Lender shall be responsible for the existence, character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of any goods purported to be represented by any Documents; any differences or variation in the character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of any goods from that expressed in any Documents; the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any Documents or of any endorsements thereon; the time, place, manner or order in which shipment of goods is made; partial or incomplete shipment of, or failure to ship, any goods referred to in a Letter of Credit or Documents; any deviation from instructions, delay, default or fraud by any shipper or other Person in connection with any goods, shipment or delivery; any breach of contract between a shipper or vendor and a Borrower; errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, telecopy, e-mail, telephone or otherwise; errors in interpretation of technical terms; the misapplication by a beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof; or any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank, Agent or any Lender, including any act or omission of a Governmental Authority. The rights and remedies of Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents shall be cumulative. Issuing Bank shall be fully subrogated to the rights and remedies of each beneficiary whose claims against Borrowers are discharged with proceeds of any Letter of Credit.
          (d) In connection with its administration of and enforcement of rights or remedies under any Letters of Credit or LC Documents, Issuing Bank shall be entitled to act, and shall be fully protected in acting, upon any certification, documentation or communication in whatever form believed by Issuing Bank, in good faith, to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by a proper Person. Issuing Bank may consult with and employ legal counsel, accountants and other experts to advise it concerning its obligations, rights and remedies, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in any action taken in good faith reliance upon, any advice given by such experts. Issuing Bank may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection with any matter relating to Letters of Credit or LC Documents, and shall not be liable for the negligence or misconduct of agents and attorneys-in-fact selected with reasonable care.
     2.3.2. .
Reimbursement; Participations
          (a) If Issuing Bank honors any request for payment under a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to Issuing Bank, on the same day (""), the amount paid by Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit, together with interest at the interest rate for Base Rate Loans from the Reimbursement Date until payment by Borrowers. The obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Bank for any payment made under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, irrevocable, and joint and several, and shall be paid without regard to
Reimbursement Date
 
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that Borrowers may have at any time against the beneficiary. Whether or not Company submits a Notice of Borrowing, Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in an amount necessary to pay all amounts due Issuing Bank on any Reimbursement Date and each Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata share of such Borrowing whether or not the Commitments have terminated, an Overadvance exists or is created thereby, or the conditions in are satisfied.
Section 6
          (b) Upon issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided Pro Rata interest and participation in all LC Obligations relating to the Letter of Credit. If Issuing Bank makes any payment under a Letter of Credit and Borrowers do not reimburse such payment on the Reimbursement Date, Agent shall promptly notify Lenders and each Lender shall promptly (within one Business Day) and unconditionally pay to Agent, for the benefit of Issuing Bank, the Lender's Pro Rata share of such payment. Upon request by a Lender, Issuing Bank shall furnish copies of any Letters of Credit and LC Documents in its possession at such time.
          (c) The obligation of each Lender to make payments to Agent for the account of Issuing Bank in connection with Issuing Bank's payment under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, not subject to any counterclaim, setoff, qualification or exception whatsoever, and shall be made in accordance with this Agreement under all circumstances, irrespective of any lack of validity or unenforceability of any Loan Documents; any draft, certificate or other document presented under a Letter of Credit having been determined to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or the existence of any setoff or defense that any Obligor may have with respect to any Obligations. Issuing Bank does not assume any responsibility for any failure or delay in performance or any breach by any Borrower or other Person of any obligations under any LC Documents. Issuing Bank does not make to Lenders any express or implied warranty, representation or guaranty with respect to the Collateral, LC Documents or any Obligor. Issuing Bank shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of any LC Documents; the validity, genuineness, enforceability, collectibility, value or sufficiency of any Collateral or the perfection of any Lien therein; or the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business, creditworthiness or legal status of any Obligor.
          (d) No Issuing Bank Indemnitee shall be liable to any Lender or other Person for any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with any LC Documents except as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Issuing Bank shall not have any liability to any Lender if Issuing Bank refrains from any action under any Letter of Credit or LC Documents until it receives written instructions from Required Lenders.
          2.3.3. . If any LC Obligations, whether or not then due or payable, shall for any reason be outstanding at any time (a) that an Event of Default exists, (b) that Availability is less than zero, (c) after the Commitment Termination Date, or (d) within 20 Business Days prior to the Termination Date, then Borrowers shall, at Issuing Bank's or Agent's
Cash Collateral
 
request, Cash Collateralize the stated amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and pay to Issuing Bank the amount of all other LC Obligations. Borrowers shall, by Issuing Bank or Agent from time to time, Cash Collateralize the LC Obligations of any Defaulting Lender. If Borrowers fail to provide any Cash Collateral as required hereunder, Lenders may (and shall upon direction of Agent) advance, as Loans, the amount of the Cash Collateral required (whether or not the Commitments have terminated, an Overadvance exists or the conditions in are satisfied).

Each Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall be irrevocable, and shall specify the amount of Loans to be converted or continued, the conversion or continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), and the duration of the Interest Period (which shall be deemed to be 30 days if not specified). If, upon the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of any LIBOR Loans, Borrowers shall have failed to deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, they shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans.
          3.1.3. . In connection with the making, conversion or continuation of any LIBOR Loans, Borrowers shall select an interest period ("") to apply, which interest period shall be 30, 60 or 90 days; , , that:

Notice of Borrowing.
          (a) Whenever Borrowers desire funding of a Borrowing of Loans, Company shall give Agent a Notice of Borrowing. Such notice must be received by Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the Business Day of the requested funding date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and (ii) at least three Business Days prior to the requested funding date, in the case of LIBOR Loans. Notices received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next Business Day. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) the amount of the Borrowing, (B) the requested funding date (which must be a Business Day), (C) whether the Borrowing is to be made as Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, and (D) in the case of LIBOR Loans, the duration of the applicable Interest Period (which shall be deemed to be 30 days if not specified).
          (b) Unless payment is otherwise timely made by Borrowers, the becoming due of any Obligations (whether principal, interest, fees or other charges, including Extraordinary Expenses, LC Obligations, Cash Collateral and Bank Product Debt) shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans on the due date, in the amount of such Obligations. The proceeds of such Loans shall be disbursed as direct payment of the relevant Obligation. In addition, during any Dominion Trigger Period, Agent may, at its option, charge such Obligations against any operating, investment or other account of a Borrower maintained with Agent or any of its Affiliates.
          (c) If Borrowers establish a controlled disbursement account with Agent or any Affiliate of Agent, then the presentation for payment of any check or other item of payment drawn on such account at a time when there are insufficient funds to cover it shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans on the date of such presentation, in the amount of the check and items presented for payment. The proceeds of such Loans may be disbursed directly to the controlled disbursement account or other appropriate account.
          4.1.2. . Each Lender shall timely honor its Commitment by funding its Pro Rata share of each Borrowing of Loans that is properly requested hereunder.
Fundings by Lenders
 
Agent shall endeavor to notify Lenders of each Notice of Borrowing (or deemed request for a Borrowing) by 12:00 noon on the proposed funding date for Base Rate Loans or by 3:00 p.m. at least two Business Days before any proposed funding of LIBOR Loans. Each Lender shall fund to Agent such Lender's Pro Rata share of the Borrowing to the account specified by Agent in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested funding date, unless Agent's notice is received after the times provided above, in which event Lender shall fund its Pro Rata share by 11:00 a.m. on the next Business Day. Subject to its receipt of such amounts from Lenders, Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Loans as directed by Company. Unless Agent shall have received (in sufficient time to act) written notice from a Lender that it does not intend to fund its Pro Rata share of a Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has deposited or promptly will deposit its share with Agent, and Agent may disburse a corresponding amount to Borrowers. If a Lender's share of any Borrowing or of any settlement pursuant to is not received by Agent, then Borrowers agree to repay to Agent the amount of such share, together with interest thereon from the date disbursed until repaid, at the rate applicable to the Borrowing.

Borrowers shall confirm each such request by prompt delivery to Agent of a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, if applicable, but if it differs in any material respect from the action taken by Agent or Lenders, the records of Agent and Lenders shall govern. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability for any loss suffered by a Borrower as a result of Agent or any Lender acting upon its understanding of telephonic or e-mailed instructions from a person believed in good faith by Agent or any Lender to be a person authorized to give such instructions on a Borrower's behalf.

     Agent may (but shall not be required to), in its discretion, retain any payments or other funds received by Agent that are to be provided to a Defaulting Lender hereunder, and may apply such funds to such Lender's defaulted obligations or readvance the funds to Borrowers in accordance with this Agreement. The failure of any Lender to fund a Loan, to make any payment in respect of LC Obligations or to otherwise perform its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations, and no Lender shall be

Number and Amount of LIBOR Loans; Determination of Rate

last
Amounts shall be applied to each category of Obligations set forth above until Full Payment thereof and then to the next category. If amounts are insufficient to satisfy a category, they shall be applied on a pro rata basis among the Obligations in the category. Amounts distributed with respect to any Bank Product Debt shall be the lesser of the applicable Bank Product Amount last reported to Agent or the actual Bank Product Debt as calculated by the methodology reported to Agent for determining the amount due. Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount to be distributed with respect to any Bank Product Debt, but may rely upon written notice of the amount (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) from the Secured Party. In the absence of such notice, Agent may assume the amount to be distributed is the Bank Product Amount last reported to it. The allocations set forth in this Section are solely to determine the rights and priorities of Agent and Lenders as among themselves, and may be changed by agreement among them without the consent of any Obligor. This Section is not for the benefit of or enforceable by any Borrower.
          5.6.2. . Agent shall not be liable for any application of amounts made by it in good faith and, if any such application is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender or other Person to which such amount should have been made shall be to recover the amount from the Person that actually received it (and, if such amount was received by any Lender, such Lender hereby agrees to return it).
Erroneous Application
 
     The ledger balance in the main Dominion Account as of the end of a Business Day shall be applied to the Obligations at the beginning of the next Business Day, during any Dominion Trigger Period. If, as a result of such application, a credit balance exists, the balance shall not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers and shall be made available to Borrowers as long as no Default or Event of Default exists. At any time applies, each Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any payments or Collateral proceeds, and agrees that Agent shall have the continuing, exclusive right to apply and reapply same against the Obligations, in such manner as Agent deems advisable.

Any failure of Agent to record anything in the Loan Account, or any error in doing so, shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrowers to pay any amount owing hereunder. Agent may maintain a single Loan Account in the name of Company, and each Borrower confirms that such arrangement shall have no effect on the joint and several character of its liability for the Obligations.

Without limiting the foregoing, Borrowers shall timely pay all Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities.
Payments Free of Taxes

Nature and Extent of Each Borrower's Liability
.
          5.11.1. . Each Borrower agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Agent and Lenders the prompt payment and performance of, all Obligations and all agreements under the Loan Documents. Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligations hereunder constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection, that such obligations shall not be discharged until Full Payment of the Obligations, and that such obligations are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability, subordination or any future modification of, or change in, any Obligations or Loan Document, or any other document, instrument or agreement to which any Obligor is or may become a party or be bound; (b) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section) or any other Loan Document, or any waiver, consent or indulgence of any kind by Agent or any Lender with respect thereto; (c) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect a Lien or to preserve rights against, any security or guaranty for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by Agent or any Lender in respect thereof (including the release of any security or guaranty); (d) the insolvency of any Obligor; (e) any election by Agent or any Lender in an Insolvency Proceeding for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (f) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; (g) the disallowance of any claims of Agent or any Lender against any Obligor for the repayment of any Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; or (h) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, except Full Payment of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations with respect to then unasserted claims).
Joint and Several Liability
          5.11.2. .
Waivers
          (a) Each Borrower expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel Agent or Lenders to marshal assets or to proceed against any Obligor, other Person or security for the payment or performance of any Obligations before, or as a condition to, proceeding against such Borrower. Each Borrower waives all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor other than Full Payment of all Obligations. It is agreed among each Borrower, Agent and Lenders that the provisions of this are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and that, but for such provisions, Agent and Lenders would decline to make Loans and issue Letters of Credit. Each Borrower acknowledges that its guaranty pursuant to this Section is necessary to the conduct and promotion of its business, and can be expected to benefit such business.
Section 5.11
          (b) Agent and Lenders may, in their discretion, in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents and Applicable Law, pursue such rights and remedies as they deem appropriate, including realization upon Collateral by judicial foreclosure or non-judicial sale or enforcement, without affecting any rights and remedies under this . If, in
Section 5.11
 
taking any action in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or otherwise, each Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that any Borrower might otherwise have had; , , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall not be considered to have waived any claim relating to any action arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower's rights of subrogation against any other Person. Agent may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent but shall be credited against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent or any other Person is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.

Section 5.11
          (b) If any Borrower makes a payment under this of any Obligations (other than amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable) (a "") that, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount that such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payments in the same proportion that such Borrower's Allocable Amount bore to the total Allocable Amounts of all Borrowers, then such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and to be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment. The "" for any Borrower shall be the maximum amount that could then be recovered from such Borrower under this without rendering such payment voidable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state fraudulent transfer or conveyance act, or similar statute or common law.

Each Borrower has requested that Agent and Lenders make this credit facility available to Borrowers on a combined basis, in order to finance Borrowers' business most efficiently and economically. Borrowers' business is a mutual and collective enterprise, and Borrowers believe that consolidation of their credit facility will enhance the borrowing power of each Borrower and ease the administration of their relationship with Lenders, all to the mutual advantage of Borrowers. Borrowers acknowledge and agree that Agent's and Lenders' willingness to extend credit to Borrowers and to administer the Collateral on a combined basis, as set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at Borrowers' request.
          5.11.5. . Each Borrower hereby subordinates any claims, including any rights at law or in equity to payment, subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off, that it may have at any time against any other Obligor, howsoever arising, to the Full Payment of all Obligations.

Separate Collateral Agent
 
transact business in any jurisdiction. If Agent believes that it may be limited in the exercise of any rights or remedies under the Loan Documents due to any Applicable Law, Agent may appoint an additional Person who is not so limited, as a separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent. If Agent so appoints a collateral agent or co-collateral agent, each right and remedy intended to be available to Agent under the Loan Documents shall also be vested in such separate agent. Every covenant and obligation necessary to the exercise thereof by such agent shall run to and be enforceable by it as well as Agent. Lenders shall execute and deliver such documents as Agent deems appropriate to vest any rights or remedies in such agent. If any collateral agent or co-collateral agent shall die or dissolve, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, then all the rights and remedies of such agent, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall vest in and be exercised by Agent until appointment of a new agent.
     Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lenders, and based upon such documents, information and analyses as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of each Obligor and its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to fund Loans and participate in LC Obligations hereunder. Each Lender has made such inquiries concerning the Loan Documents, the Collateral and each Obligor as such Lender feels necessary. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that the other Lenders and Agent have made no representations or warranties concerning any Obligor, any Collateral or the legality, validity, sufficiency or enforceability of any Loan Documents or Obligations. Each Lender will, independently and without reliance upon the other Lenders or Agent, and based upon such financial statements, documents and information as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make and rely upon its own credit decisions in making Loans and participating in LC Obligations, and in taking or refraining from any action under any Loan Documents. Except for notices, reports and other information expressly requested by a Lender, Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any notices, reports or certificates furnished to Agent by any Obligor or any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition, business or Properties of any Obligor (or any of its Affiliates) which may come into possession of Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDJune 5, 2009Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fourth-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 declined 19.6% year-over-year to $155.5 million. Hardware sales decreased 27.7% versus a 2.7% increase in software and service sales compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. On a segment basis, the Technology Solutions Group's ("TSG") revenue declined 25% relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as the market for large IT infrastructure projects remained challenging. The Retail Solutions Group's ("RSG") revenue decreased 14%, while the Hospitality Solutions Group ("HSG") grew 15% due to strong InfoGenesis product sales compared to the same quarter last year.
With a higher mix of software and services sales and increased vendor rebates, gross margin improved to 25.9% of sales, compared with 24.2% of sales in the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $48.4 million for the quarter, down $11.0 million from prior year primarily due to cost-saving actions executed throughout fiscal 2009. In the quarter, the company also recorded increased bad debt expense of $0.6 million due to receivable write-offs and higher professional fees of $0.5 million associated with the company's recent proxy contest. The company recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of $86.2 million and a $3.9 million restructuring charge associated with an additional $10 million of annualized cost-reduction initiatives executed in the fourth quarter.
Including goodwill and intangible asset impairments and restructuring charges ("Charges") of $90.1 million, the loss from continuing operations for the period was $114.6 million or a loss of $5.07 per share compared with a loss from continuing operations of $4.3 million or a loss of $0.18 per share in the prior year fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding Charges, was a loss of $1.8 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $2.3 million a year ago. The adjusted EBITDA loss, excluding Charges, was primarily due to the continued, significant softness in the enterprise hardware market and other charges, including increased bad debt and professional fees.
"While the market remained weak in the fourth quarter, particularly as it relates to hardware sales, we were pleased with the improvement in adjusted EBITDA, given the 20% decline in sales," said Martin
 
Ellis, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The cost-savings initiated in fiscal 2009 are beginning to be reflected in performance."
Fiscal 2009 Unaudited Results of Operations
Revenue in fiscal 2009 decreased 3.9% to $730.7 million compared to fiscal 2008, largely due to lower enterprise hardware sales. In fiscal 2009, hardware sales declined 9.5% to $508.7 million, compared with $562.3 million in fiscal 2008. Higher service and software revenues partially offset this decrease. Compared with fiscal 2008, service revenue increased 15.1% to $145.0 million, and software revenue advanced 7.1% to $77.0 million.
Gross profit for the year improved more than $20 million to $198.7 million, versus $178.5 million in fiscal 2008. Gross margin improved 370 basis points, from 23.5% last year to 27.2% in fiscal 2009 due to a greater proportion of services and software revenue and higher vendor rebates.
SG&A expense was $206.1 million, compared with $196.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of fiscal 2008 acquisitions in full fiscal 2009 results, which added approximately $14 million to SG&A, and an increase in intangibles amortization related to acquisitions of $2.2 million. Against these increases, the company realized almost $15 million from cost-saving actions in fiscal 2009. In total, in excess of $35 million in annual costs were eliminated in fiscal 2009, which will be fully realized in fiscal 2010.
Restructuring charges associated with cost-saving actions were $40.8 million for the year. Asset impairment charges related to the write-down of acquisition-related goodwill of $229.5 million and intangible assets of $2.4 million totaled $231.9 million in fiscal 2009. Including Charges of $272.7 million, the loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 was $282.2 million, or a loss of $12.49 per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $1.9 million, or $0.07 per share, in fiscal 2008. Interest income decreased $12.6 million in fiscal 2009 due to lower cash balances. Other expense in fiscal 2009 was $2.6 million as a result of a $3.0 million reserve established for potential loss in the company's investment in The Reserve Fund's Primary Fund, compared with other income of $6.6 million in fiscal 2008 primarily related to income from the company's minority investment in Magirus.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Charges, was $19.7 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $5.7 million a year ago. The increase was due to cost-saving actions the company initiated throughout fiscal 2009 and increased gross profit from higher-margin software and services revenues and vendor rebates.
Ellis continued: "Fiscal 2009 was an extraordinary year characterized by adverse market conditions and significant restructuring. Adjusted for the timing of acquisitions, Agilysys sales were off 12% year-over-year, reflecting weak demand for IT infrastructure hardware. However, cost-reduction actions we have taken position the company for improved profitability going forward."
Business Outlook
With the ongoing unprecedented uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, visibility remains limited. Due to this uncertainty, the company continues to suspend revenue guidance until economic conditions further stabilize.
Notwithstanding the ongoing weak market conditions, the company expects fiscal 2010 adjusted EBITDA to exceed $25 million with no charges related to asset impairment and restructuring, compared with fiscal 2009 adjusted EBITDA, excluding Charges, of $19.7 million.
Stock compensation is expected to be approximately $4 million and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $10 million, including $3 million related to capitalization of certain Guest360 development costs and approximately $5.5 million in Oracle ERP implementation costs. Also, the company expects to generate in excess of $10 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDAug. 5, 2009Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for its fiscal 2010 first quarter ended June 30, 2009.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
First-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Consolidated revenue for the fiscal 2010 first quarter declined 27.6% from the year-ago period to $130.2 million. Hardware sales declined 31.6%, services declined 25.7% and software declined 1.1%, compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The lower revenues reflect continued softness in demand in addition to customers delaying purchase commitments.
Gross margin in the quarter was 24.7%, compared with 26.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, largely due to lower services revenues and services margins.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was down $11.7 million, or 20.7%, to $44.8 million, compared with $56.6 million in the prior-year first quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to cost-reduction actions initiated during fiscal 2009 and lower incentive compensation.
The reported loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $12.4 million, or a loss of $0.55 per share, compared with the loss of $60.1 million, or a loss of $2.66 per share, in the prior year quarter. Prior-year results included $56.7 million in charges related to asset impairment and restructuring.
Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, was a loss of $6.4 million, versus a loss of $1.9 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in gross profit from lower sales more than offset the $11.7 million reduction in SG&A expense.
"We were disappointed with the weaker-than-anticipated sales for the quarter. The lingering malaise in IT spending negatively impacted product and service revenue across the board," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "Our cash flow was strong in the quarter and we have begun to realize the benefits of the cost savings initiatives previously executed. However, we continue to evaluate our cost structure to address current market demand."
Financial Position
At June 30, 2009, cash on hand increased by $14.8 million to $51.0 million from $36.2 million at March 31, 2009. The Company is debt-free and has no outstanding balances on its $50 million credit facility. Additionally, Agilysys terminated and paid off its floor plan finance facility using cash flow from operations in early May 2009.
 
Dividend
The Company also announced today that the Board of Directors voted to eliminate the payment of cash dividends. With the evolution of the Company's business and the current quarter's weak operating performance that resulted in the Company not maintaining its fixed charge coverage ratio, the Board voted to eliminate the dividend. The elimination of the dividend will preserve approximately $2.7 million in cash on an annualized basis and will further improve financial flexibility.
Business Outlook
With the ongoing uncertainty into IT demand, visibility remains limited. Due to this uncertainty, the Company continues to suspend revenue guidance and is also suspending its earnings guidance until visibility improves.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be held at 11:00 a.m. ET today to review fiscal 2010 first-quarter results. A slide deck will be the basis for the review. Both the slide deck and the conference call can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of . A replay of the call will be archived on the website.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELANDNov. 4, 2009Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2010 second quarter and first half ended September 30, 2009.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Second-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Revenue declined 9.0% to $156.0 million, compared with $171.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Hardware sales declined 3.5%, services declined 32.6% and software sales increased 14.0%. Consolidated revenues rebounded 19.8% from the $130.2 million reported in the first quarter, due to double-digit growth in hardware, software and services.
Cost-cutting initiatives and lower acquisition-related intangible amortization drove selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense down $12.4 million, or 23.9%, to $39.6 million. The Company recently executed an additional $9 million in annual savings of which approximately $4 million will be realized in the second half of fiscal 2010.
The Company's operating income, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges ("Charges"), improved $6.2 million to $4.3 million from the operating loss of $1.9 million last year. Lower sales and gross profit year-over-year were more than offset by lower SG&A expense. Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding Charges, increased 44.9% to $7.4 million for the quarter, compared with $5.1 million a year ago.
Agilysys reported net income from continuing operations of $2.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, a significant increase from the loss of $105.3 million, or a loss of $4.66 per share, recorded in the previous year.
"We are pleased to report strong sequential growth in sales and positive net earnings for the quarter. The improvement in profitability reflects the tangible benefits realized from our cost-saving efforts," said Martin Ellis, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to improved bottom-line performance, our order pipeline has started to show modest recovery from the depressed levels of the past several quarters."
Fiscal 2010 First-Half Unaudited Results of Operations
First-half 2010 revenue was $286.2 million compared with revenue of $351.2 million in the first six months of 2009. Revenue in the first half of fiscal 2010 decreased 18.5% reflecting lower sales in each of the company's three business segments. Hardware declined 13.6%, services declined 36.3% and software decreased 8.2%.
SG&A expense declined $23.7 million, or 22.0%, to $84.1 million, largely due to cost reductions. Approximately $44 million in annual costs have been eliminated since the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 when the company began aggressively reducing SG&A expenses to align cost structure with deteriorating
 
market demand. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Charges, was $1.1 million for the six-month period, versus $3.3 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2009.
For the first six months of fiscal 2010, the company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $9.5 million, or a loss of $0.42 per share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $165.4 million, or a loss of $7.33 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 2009.
Business Outlook
The year-over-year declines in revenue have moderated and while some economic indicators have improved, market conditions still reflect uncertainty regarding the overall business environment and demand for IT products. Ellis commented: "The business is stabilizing, our pipeline has improved, and we expect to see a seasonal increase in sales in our third quarter ending December. As we look to the balance of fiscal 2010, we plan to continue to focus on those items under our control that can help produce tangible improvements in results. Near-term, we are optimistic regarding our outlook for the third quarter of the fiscal year and expect financial performance in second half to improve versus the first half."
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be held at 11:00 a.m. ET on November 4, 2009 to review unaudited second-quarter and first-half fiscal 2010 results. A slide deck will be the basis for the review.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELANDFebruary 3, 2010Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2010 third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2009.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fiscal 2010 Third-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Revenue declined 1.7% to $220.4 million from the $224.1 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Compared with the prior-year period, hardware sales increased 12.6%, offset by a 39.1% decline in services revenue. Software revenue during the quarter was down slightly compared with last year. Due to a higher proportion of hardware sales and lower service revenue, consolidated gross margin declined to 23.3% of sales during the period, compared with 26.3% in the prior year.
Cost-cutting initiatives and lower acquisition-related intangible amortization drove selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense down $7.0 million, or 14.7%, to $40.5 million during the quarter. Operating income increased $11.8 million to $9.9 million, a substantial improvement from the operating loss of $1.9 million in last year's quarter. Last year's quarterly loss included $13.4 million in restructuring charges, compared with restructuring charges recorded in the current quarter of $0.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $13.0 million for the quarter, compared with $4.8 million a year ago.
"The solid performance in the quarter reflects a stabilizing demand environment and our focus on managing cost structure," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "We are pleased to report that our turnaround remains on track as we generated strong net earnings during the quarter."
Agilysys reported third-quarter net income of $14.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, a significant increase from the loss of $3.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, recorded in the previous year's quarter. Other income in the quarter included $2.3 million from a litigation settlement and $2.4 million from the gain recognized on a distribution from the Reserve Fund. Combined these items represented $0.18 per diluted share.
Fiscal 2010 Nine-Month Unaudited Results of Operations
Nine-month fiscal 2010 revenue was $506.0 million versus $575.3 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2009, reflecting lower sales in each of the company's three business segments. Hardware, software and services posted declines of 2.5%, 5.2%, and 39.3% respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago. Gross margin declined to 25.1% from 27.1% in last year's nine months due to the mix of higher hardware and lower services.
SG&A declined by $30.7 million, or 19.8%, to $124.7 million, largely due to cost-reduction initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.0 million for the nine-month period, versus a loss of $161.2 million in the fiscal 2009 nine-months, which included asset impairment and restructuring charges of $182.6 million. The company reported net income of $5.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2010 nine-month period, compared with a net loss of $170.3 million, or $7.54 per share, in the same year-ago period.
 
Business Outlook
"Uncertainty remains regarding the macroeconomic environment and the prospects for growth in demand for IT products and services. However, we are encouraged by the improving demand environment we've seen in the past two quarters. Near-term, we are optimistic regarding our outlook for the final quarter of the fiscal year and expect improved year-over-year financial performance. We have successfully restructured the organization to be profitable at lower revenue levels and are now well positioned with the operating leverage to capitalize on any future increase in IT spending," said Ellis.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be held at 11:00 a.m. ET today to review unaudited fiscal 2010 third-quarter and nine-month results. A slide deck will be the basis for the review. Both the slide deck and the conference call can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of . Additionally, a replay of the call will be archived on the website.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDMay 3, 2010Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced it expects to report fiscal 2010 fourth-quarter revenues of between $130 million and $140 million. This compares with $155 million reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2009. Previously, the company indicated that it expected customer demand levels to be similar to the prior-year.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
The decline in revenues from the prior-year fourth quarter is primarily attributable to lower-than-expected sales in the company's Technology Solutions Group ("TSG"), particularly in the Sun product lines. Sales of Sun products continue to be impacted by the company's transition of its go-to-market strategy to address changes as a result of Oracle's integration of Sun.
"We are disappointed with technology solutions revenues but remain optimistic about the opportunities for TSG and continue to further align our processes and practices with those of our key technology partners to drive increased revenue and profitability," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "While TSG revenue was down, the effectiveness of our cost savings initiatives and our disciplined focus on working capital management significantly improved cash during fiscal 2010."
Despite the lower projected revenue, fourth-quarter fiscal 2010 gross profit margin is expected to increase from 25.7% recorded in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2009 to between 26.2% and 26.8%. The improvement in consolidated margins is due to the mix of business favoring the company's relatively higher-margin hospitality and retail segments.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are consistent with management's expectations and prior-quarter run rates of $40 million to $43 million.
The company had cash on hand of approximately $66 million as of March 31, 2010, generating positive cash flow of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2010. Previously Agilysys stated that it expected to generate $15 million to $20 million of positive cash flow in fiscal 2010.
Agilysys plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 financial results in early June.

This release contains certain management expectations, which may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDJune 3, 2010Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2010.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fourth-Quarter 2010 Unaudited Results of Operations
Year-over-year revenue declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The company reported revenue of $135.8 million, which was 13% lower than the $155.5 million reported in last year's comparable quarter. The lower revenue reflected weaker-than-anticipated demand in the company's Technology Solutions Group.
Sales of hardware, software and services declined 13%, 25% and 3%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Gross margin expanded to 26.4% of sales, compared with 25.7% of sales in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter. The improvement in gross margin resulted primarily from a larger proportion of sales being derived from proprietary services and the company's higher-margin Hospitality and Retail Solutions Groups. A decline in vendor incentives tempered the favorable margin impact from the change in sales mix during the period.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $42.6 million for the quarter, a decrease of $4.8 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation and intangible amortization.
Operating loss for the quarter narrowed to $6.9 million, a notable improvement from the operating loss reported in last year's fourth quarter of $97.5 million. Quarterly results for the prior year included charges related to restructuring and asset impairment ("Charges") totaling $90.1 million, compared with $0.1 million in the current year. Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding Charges, was a loss of $3.6 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $0.9 million a year ago.
The net loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.5 million, or a loss of $0.02 per share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $114.6 million, or a loss of $5.07 per share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
"Despite the very difficult market environment and lower sales levels experienced throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress in resetting the cost structure and making select, but important, investments in the company," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "Moreover, our focus on working capital management and strong cash generation position us very well to advance our growth strategy of developing higher-value solutions with more proprietary software and services."
Fiscal 2010 Unaudited Results of Operations
Full-year revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased 12.4% to $640.4 million from $730.7 million in fiscal 2009 due to the weak economic environment and lower levels of corporate IT spending. Hardware sales, which
 
comprised 69% of total sales, declined 5%, while sales of software and services were down 9% and 33%, respectively, compared with the prior fiscal year.
As a result of the lower sales, full-year gross profit declined $34.6 million, or 17.6%, to $161.5 million, versus $196.1 million in fiscal 2009. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 25.2% in fiscal 2010, compared with 26.8% last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by lower vendor rebates and lower selling margins.
SG&A expense decreased $31.7 million, or 16%, to $167.2 million, compared with $198.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to cost-reduction efforts, lower intangible amortization and lower variable compensation.
The operating loss for the year was $6.8 million, compared with the operating loss of $275.4 million in fiscal 2009. Charges related to restructuring and asset impairment totaled $272.7 million in the prior year, versus $1.1 million in the current year. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Charges, was $10.1 million for fiscal 2010, compared with $24.3 million a year ago. The decrease was due to lower sales and lower gross margin, reflecting a challenging IT demand environment for most of the year.
Full-year net income from continuing operations was $3.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010. Net income included a $5.2 million income tax benefit recorded for losses that were carried back to offset prior years' taxable income and reversal of prior-year reserves. This compares with the net loss from continuing operations of $282.2 million, or a loss of $12.49 per share, last year.
Accounts Receivable and Cash
The accounts receivable portfolio improved significantly in fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding declined from 88 days at fiscal year-end 2009 to 69 days at fiscal year-end 2010, resulting in a $49.5 million reduction in accounts receivable. In addition, the average age of trade receivables improved by 6 days. Strong accounts receivable and working capital management contributed to cash on hand growing $29.3 million in fiscal 2010, reaching $65.5 million at March 31, 2010.
Business Outlook
Ellis continued: "We are a leaner and more focused company. Our investments in infrastructure and product development were sustained throughout the recession and are expected to make important contributions to future success. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we went live on our new integrated Oracle ERP platform, which will further improve financial reporting, internal controls and operating efficiencies, as well as enhance customer service."
"HSG and RSG continue to gain traction, while demand in TSG remains uncertain in the short-term. Longerterm, we expect to benefit from broader demand for IT products and services. We intend to provide more comprehensive guidance as the demand environment becomes clearer," Ellis concluded.
The outlook for cash-flow generation remains strong and the company expects to generate $10 million to $15 million in cash flow in fiscal 2011. The company also expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately $10 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $12.5 million.
The company will file its Form 10-K with the SEC next week.

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Agilysys, Inc. (the "Committee") approved fiscal year 2011 target annual incentives for the Company's named executive officers, as set forth below:
Fiscal Year 2011 Target Annual Incentives
For Messrs. Kossin, Ellis and Stout, as corporate management, the achievement of target revenue, gross profit, EBITDA and individual objectives entitles each named executive officer to receive a target annual incentive cash payment. For Mr. Civils and Ms. Stehle, as business segment heads, receipt of a target annual incentive cash payment is based on the achievement of target business segment gross profit and EBITDA, corporate EBITDA and individual objectives. For EBITDA goals, to receive a threshold payout of 50% of the target incentive, achievement of at least 80% of the performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 150% of the performance measure is required. For gross profit goals, to receive a threshold payout of 1% of the target incentive, achievement above 90% of the performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 115% of the performance measure is required. For revenue goals, to receive a threshold payout of 1% of the target incentive, achievement above 87.5% of the performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 118.75% of the performance measure is required.
The Committee also approved fiscal year 2011 long-term incentive awards and fiscal year 2010 long-term incentive award payouts for the Company's named executive officers, as set forth below:
Fiscal Year 2011 Long-Term Incentives
Stock settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) were granted to the named executive officers as fiscal year 2011 long-term incentive awards, based on the grant date closing price for the Company's Common Shares of $6.20. The SSARs will vest ratably over a three-year period, on March 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
Fiscal Year 2010 Long-Term Incentive Payouts
In May 2009, the named executive officers were awarded a targeted number of performance shares, with the number of shares earned based on fiscal year 2010 EBITDA and improvement in receivables. The Company did not meet threshold EBITDA goals, but improvements in receivables contributed to a significant increase in cash in fiscal year 2010, and earned performance shares were based on improvements in receivables. Some of the improvement in receivables was attributed to the fiscal year 2010 decline in revenues as compared to fiscal year 2009, and the Committee determined to reduce payouts to reward only for the improved receivables that were not attributable to the decline in revenues, resulting in a payout of performance shares that were earned upon the filing of the Company's fiscal year 2010 Form 10-K, as set forth below.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDAug. 4, 2010Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for its fiscal 2011 first quarter ended June 30, 2010.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
First-Quarter 2011 Unaudited Results of Operations
Consolidated revenue for the fiscal 2011 first quarter increased 1.9% from the year-ago period to $132.4 million. Services increased 11%, software increased 35%, and hardware sales declined 7%, compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue from the Company's Hospitality Solutions Group increased 44%, while the Retail and Technology Solutions groups declined 3% and 4%, respectively.
Gross margin in the quarter expanded to 25.6%, compared with 24.5% in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. The improvement was largely due to the higher software and services revenue, which carries higher average margins compared with hardware sales. The margin improvement was partially offset by a decline in vendor incentives in the quarter, as well as pricing pressure on hardware.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense declined 11% to $40.1 million, compared with $44.8 million in the prior-year first quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit expense and acquisition-related intangibles amortization.
The pre-tax loss for the quarter narrowed to $5.8 million from $12.4 million last year. Despite the pre-tax loss, the Company recorded income tax expense of $4.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 related to a correction of an error in the Company's prior period deferred tax valuation allowance.
The reported net loss for the quarter was $10.3 million, or a loss of $0.45 per share, compared with the net loss of $12.4 million, or a loss of $0.55 per share, in the prior-year quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding restructuring charges, was a loss of $2.7 million, versus a loss of $6.6 million in last year's first quarter.
Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer of Agilysys, commented: "Our strategy of developing higher-value solutions with more proprietary software and services is contributing to improved margins. On a segment basis, HSG and RSG met expectations. While TSG revenue lagged expectations during the quarter, we successfully increased attach rates, bundling more software and services with hardware sales."
Financial Position
At June 30, 2010, cash on hand was $50.0 million, compared with $51.0 million at June 30, 2009, and $65.5 million at March 31, 2010. The Company is currently debt-free and has no outstanding balance on its $50 million credit facility. The Company's year-to-date decrease in cash is primarily related to higher accounts receivable balances in connection with the transition of invoicing to the Company's new ERP platform. The Company indicated that the transition process has been largely completed and invoicing and collections are expected to improve in future quarters.
 
Business Outlook
"Our investments in people, infrastructure and product development are starting to make the contributions that we expected. The demand environment has improved which bodes well for the future and our new integrated Oracle ERP platform will, over time, contribute to improved financial reporting, internal controls and operating efficiencies, as well as enhance customer service," Ellis concluded.
The outlook for cash-flow generation remains strong and the Company expects to generate $10 million to $15 million in cash flow in fiscal 2011. Agilysys also expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately $10 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $12.5 million.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be held at 11:00 a.m. ET today to review unaudited fiscal 2011 first-quarter results. A slide deck will be the basis for the review. Both the slide deck and the conference call can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of . A replay of the call will be archived on the website.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELANDNov. 4, 2010Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2011 second quarter and first half ended September 30, 2010.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fiscal 2011 Second-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Consolidated revenue increased 17.7% to $183.8 million in the second quarter, compared with $156.2 million in last year's comparable quarter. Hardware and software sales grew 21.1% and 9.4%, respectively, while service revenue was up 11.0% from last year. Revenue from the Company's Retail and Technology Solutions Groups grew by 23% over the prior year, offset by the Hospitality Solutions Group's 12% decline.
Gross margin declined in the quarter to 22.2%, down from 28.1% in the second quarter of last year. Gross margin declined due to lower vendor rebates, ongoing competitive pricing and a higher proportion of hardware sales compared to the prior year quarter.
SG&A expenses declined as a percentage of sales for the second quarter to 23.7%, compared with 25.6% in the prior year quarter. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $43.5 million, up from $40.0 million in last year's second quarter, as a result of expensing $2.1 million of software development costs and $1.5 million in increased incentive compensation. The expensed development costs were $1.1 million of implementation costs associated with the new Oracle ERP system and $1.0 million in development costs related to Guest360. The comparable costs were capitalized in last year's second quarter.
TM
The Company reported an operating loss for the quarter of $2.8 million, versus operating income of $3.8 million in last year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, was $0.6 million for the quarter, compared with $7.0 million in the prior year second quarter. (See reconciliation below.)
Agilysys reported a net loss of $2.2 million, or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share, for the second quarter, compared with net income of $2.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the previous year's quarter.
Commenting on the results, Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer, stated, "We are pleased to report strong sales growth, as our businesses continued to gain traction with our focus on bundling more software and services in the solutions we sell. However, significantly lower vendor rebates and ongoing pricing competition pressured margins and profitability during the quarter." Ellis added, "The Company continues to invest in Guest360 by building additional features and functions into the software, which will be brought to market in the next year."

Consolidated sales in the first half of fiscal year 2011 increased 10.5% to $316.3 million, compared with the $286.2 million reported in the first half of fiscal 2010. Sales for hardware, software, and services increased 8.4%, 21.0%, and 10.8%, respectively, compared with the prior year's first half.
Gross margin decreased to 23.6% in the first half, compared with 26.5% in fiscal 2010's first six months. Gross margin declined due to lower vendor rebates and ongoing competitive pricing.
SG&A expenses were $83.5 million, or 26.4% of net sales, down from $84.8 million, or 29.6% of sales, in the first half of 2010, as a result of lower acquisition related intangibles amortization, partially offset by the expensing of Guest360 development costs and non-capitalized ERP implementation expenses.
For the six-month period, the Company reported an operating loss of $9.3 million, compared with an operating loss of $9.2 million in the first half of the prior fiscal year. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.2 million, versus a $0.4 million gain in the first half of the prior year. (See reconciliation below.) For the first half of fiscal 2011, the net loss was $12.5 million, or a loss of $0.55 per diluted share, versus the previous year's net loss of $9.6 million, or a loss of $0.42 per diluted share.
"As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on growing our business, especially our higher-margin proprietary software and service revenues as well as address cost structure to improve our overall profitability," Ellis concluded.
Fiscal Year 2011 Business Outlook
The Company stated that it expects to generate consolidated revenue of $690 million to $710 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, of $7 million to $10 million in fiscal year 2011. Further, the Company expects to incur stock compensation of approximately $3.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $12.5 million to $13.0 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $8 million to $9 million, of which $5 million is related to capitalized costs associated with the development of Guest360 and the implementation of the Company's new Oracle ERP system.
Cash on hand is expected to be $60 million to $75 million as of March 31, 2011.
A conference call will be held today, November 4, 2010, at 11:00 a.m. ET to review unaudited second-quarter and first-half fiscal 2011 results. A slide deck will be the basis for the review.

Exhibit 99.1
 
CLEVELANDFebruary 2, 2011Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for its fiscal 2011 third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2010.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fiscal 2011 Third-Quarter Unaudited Results of Operations
Third-quarter fiscal 2011 consolidated net revenue increased $1.2 million to $217.0 million from $215.8 million in the prior year. Software and services sales grew 7.3% and 8.2%, respectively, while hardware revenue decreased 2.2% from the prior year. Revenue from the Company's Hospitality Solutions and Technology Solutions groups grew 8.2% and 1.6%, respectively, from the prior-year third quarter, offsetting an 8.2% revenue decline in the Retail Solutions Group.
Third-quarter gross margin declined to 21.5% from 23.2% in the prior year third quarter, primarily due to lower vendor incentives and services margins.
"We are pleased with continued positive demand momentum and expect to report approximately 10% revenue growth this fiscal year. Our solution strategy showed continued success as the higher quarterly revenues reflect our initiatives to accelerate software and services volumes. In addition, our point of sale businesses, being hospitality and retail, continue to improve with our focus on increasing both proprietary content and cross selling," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "However, the positive traction in the market place was offset by lower gross margins, primarily due to lower vendor rebates."
SG&A expenses in the fiscal 2011 third quarter were $44.9 million, of which $1.1 million relates to Guest360
TM
development costs that were capitalized in the fiscal 2010 third quarter and $0.7 million, associated with the Company's ERP implementation, which will decrease significantly beginning in fiscal year 2012. Last year's quarterly expenses of $40.5 million also included the benefit of a $1.6 million credit related to a litigation settlement.
The Company reported operating income for the quarter of $1.9 million, versus $8.6 million in last year's third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, was $5.4 million for the quarter, compared with $12.6 million in the prior-year third quarter. (See reconciliation below.)
Agilysys reported net income of $2.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2011 third quarter, compared with net income of $13.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the previous year's quarter.
"We have continued our aggressive investment in Guest360
TM
, our next generation hotel management system, which together with our previous investments in market-leading, complementary software solutions, including property management, point of sale and inventory and procurement, positions us very well for long-term success in the hospitality industry," said Mr. Ellis.
 
Fiscal 2011 Nine-Month Unaudited Results of Operations
Consolidated net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 increased 6.7% to $531.7 million, compared with the $498.5 million reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. Sales of hardware, software and services increased 3.7%, 20.2% and 9.4%, respectively, compared with the prior-year period. Revenue from the Company's Hospitality Solutions, Technology Solutions and Retail Solutions groups grew 9.8%, 7.2% and 2.1%, respectively, from the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
Gross margin decreased to 22.8% in the first nine months, compared with 25.2% in the same year-ago period, due to the lower vendor incentives and competitive pricing pressure.
SG&A expenses were $128.4 million, compared with $125.3 million in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily attributable to non-capitalized ERP implementation expenses of $2.5 million, expensing of Guest360 development costs of $2.3 million and the absence of a $1.6 million benefit related to a litigation settlement in the current fiscal year. This was partially offset by lower acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which declined by $2.4 million.
For the nine-month period, the Company reported an operating loss of $7.5 million, compared with an operating loss of $0.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. Year to date, adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, was $3.2 million, versus $13.0 million in the first nine months of the prior year. (See reconciliation below.)
For the first nine months of fiscal 2011, the net loss was $10.5 million, or a loss of $0.46 per share, versus the previous year's net income of $4.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Net income for the first nine months is decreased due to lower operating income, a decrease in other income of $3.7M due to the absence of a non-recurring gain and litigation settlement and higher income taxes related to a $3.8M charge for valuation allowance recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2011 Business Outlook
"While year-to-date revenue and expenses have met our expectations, our bottom line results have been disappointing. Given the gross margin pressure we have faced, we are executing on $7 million in costs savings in the current quarter. These savings will position the Company for approximately break-even operating income on a go forward basis. As we move forward with our fiscal 2012 budgeting and planning process, we will develop more comprehensive profitability targets focused on materially improving our bottom line," Ellis concluded.
The Company stated that it expects to generate consolidated revenue of $690 million to $710 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, of $3 million to $6 million in fiscal year 2011. Further, the Company expects to incur stock compensation of approximately $3.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $13.0 million to $13.5 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $8 million to $9 million, of which $5 million is related to capitalized costs associated with the development of Guest360 and the implementation of the Company's new Oracle ERP system.
Cash on hand is expected to be $60 million to $75 million as of March 31, 2011.

Effective March 25, 2011, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") terminated the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). The SERP, a defined benefit plan, was established during fiscal year 2000 to provide retirement benefits to certain executive officers and key members of management. The SERP provides cash benefits in an annual amount not to exceed 50% of the executive's final average annual earnings, reduced by other Company-funded retirement benefits, such as matches provided in the Company's 401(k) and benefit equalization plans, profit sharing amounts contributed to those plans, and a percentage of Social Security retirement benefits.
To reduce compensation costs, the SERP was closed to new participants in January 2009. As a continuation of cost reduction initiatives, the Company terminated the SERP. Distribution of all benefits remaining in the SERP will be made as soon as practicable after March 25, 2012, in a single lump sum payment that is equal to the actuarial equivalent, as of the date of distribution, of each SERP participant's accrued benefit, calculated in accordance with the SERP. The Company's Chief Executive Officer was the only remaining active employee in the SERP, and the present value of his accumulated benefit in the SERP at March 31, 2011, the Company's fiscal year-end, will be disclosed in the Company's 2011 Proxy Statement.

On May 16, 2011, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release describing its preliminary results of operations for its full fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELANDMay 16, 2011Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced that it is lowering its guidance for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Projected results are unaudited and subject to the ongoing audit closing process.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
The Company now expects to report consolidated revenue of approximately $676 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, ranging between a loss of $3 million and break-even for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Cash on hand was approximately $74 million as of March 31, 2011. The Company also expects to record a non-cash charge ranging between $34 million and $42 million for impairment of acquisition-related goodwill and intangible assets in its Technology Solutions Group in fiscal 2011.
"Revenues for the Technology Solutions Group (TSG) and Retail Solutions Group (RSG) are expected to be below the internal estimates used to provide the previous guidance," said Martin Ellis, president and chief executive officer. "Strong execution in our Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) is expected to result in revenue above the internal estimates used to provide the previous guidance."
The Company will provide more detail on its performance when it announces its fiscal 2011 fourth-quarter and full-year results on or before June 14, 2011.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Company's debt agreement. The non-GAAP measures included in this release have not been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is available without unreasonable effort. Reconciliations of EBITDA to GAAP net income for various periods, which include quantitative reconciliations of all the expenses excluded from the non-GAAP financial information included in this press release, are included in our quarterly earnings releases.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On May 28, 2011, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company"), Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC, OnX Acquisition LLC and OnX Enterprise Solutions Limited (with OnX Acquisition LLC, "OnX") entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell its Technology Solutions Group business (the "TSG Business") to OnX for a purchase price of $64 million, subject to a possible downward adjustment based on final working capital (the "TSG Sale"). A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the transaction is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company will sell to OnX all of the outstanding stock or equity of the following wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company: (i) Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC; (ii) Agilysys Canada, Inc.; and (iii) Agilysys Europe Technology Solutions Limited (the "Subsidiaries") and Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC will sell certain of its intangible assets to OnX Enterprise Solutions Limited. In connection with the transaction, certain assets of the TSG Business that are held by the Company, primarily employees, leases and certain contracts, will be transferred to one or more of the Subsidiaries prior to closing the TSG Sale.
Each of the Company and OnX has made representations, warranties and covenants relating to itself and, in the case of the Company, with respect to the TSG Business. The Purchase Agreement provides that each of the Company and OnX will indemnify the other for certain losses, subject to certain limits. The closing of the TSG Sale is subject to certain conditions, including authorization by the Company's shareholders. The closing of the TSG Sale is expected to occur in the Company's fiscal 2012 second quarter, which ends September 30, 2011.
Between the time of signing the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the TSG Sale, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company must cause the TSG Business to be conducted in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously conducted and to use reasonable best efforts to keep intact the respective businesses of the Subsidiaries, keep available the services of their current employees and preserve the good will of their customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others with whom they deal. The Company has also agreed to prohibit the Subsidiaries from taking certain actions (subject to ordinary course exceptions, certain negotiated dollar caps and other exceptions) without the consent of OnX. Among the more significant restrictions or limitations are those relating to: increasing compensation or benefit commitments; hiring new employees; incurring debt; making acquisitions, dispositions, investments or capital expenditures; and entering into certain company contracts.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company is subject to a non-solicitation provision which prohibits the Company from soliciting, initiating, or knowingly encouraging the submission of any inquiries, offers or proposals relating to a takeover of the TSG Business with any third party (a "TSG Proposal"). The Company may not withdraw the recommendation of its board of directors to the shareholders in favor of the TSG Sale or approve or recommend a TSG Proposal except that, prior to shareholder approval, the Company may terminate the Purchase
Agreement to enter into an alternative TSG Proposal or to enter into a proposal for the sale of the Company as a whole that is conditioned upon termination of the Purchase Agreement ("Agilysys Proposal") or withdraw its recommendation in favor of the TSG Sale if the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such TSG Proposal or Agilysys Proposal constitutes a superior proposal. The Company's board of directors may also withdraw its recommendation in favor of the TSG Sale if a material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of the Purchase Agreement, and the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that failing to make a change of recommendation in light of such material development or change in circumstances would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and gives OnX five business days advance notice of its intention to do so. The Company must notify OnX if it receives an unsolicited TSG Proposal or an Agilysys Proposal. Upon determining that a TSG Proposal or Agilysys Proposal constitutes a superior proposal, the Company must provide OnX five business days prior written notice of its board of directors' intention to accept such superior proposal, and OnX has five business days to make a counterproposal. A "superior proposal" is a TSG Proposal or an Agilysys Proposal that the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is more favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders than the TSG Sale, taking into account the termination fee to be paid to OnX and any alternative proposal offer by OnX.
The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of the Company and OnX. The Company may become obligated to pay a termination fee of $2,250,000 if the Purchase Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company to approve a definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal; (ii) by OnX because the Company's board of directors withdraws or modifies its recommendation regarding the TSG Sale or approves, recommends or enters into a TSG Proposal or an Agilysys Proposal; (iii) by OnX or the Company, following public disclosure or direct delivery to the Company's shareholders of a TSG Proposal, because either (1) the closing of the TSG Sale has not occurred by the outside date or (2) the TSG Sale is not authorized by the Company's shareholders; or (iv) by OnX because the Company is in breach of the no solicitation provisions under the Purchase Agreement and the TSG Sale is not authorized by our shareholders. Additionally, the Company must pay OnX's expenses up to $1,250,000 if the deal doesn't close because shareholders do not approve it.
The Company and OnX will enter into a transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement") and a non-compete agreement (the "Non-compete Agreement") upon the closing of the TSG Sale. Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Company will provide certain transitional, administrative and support services to OnX for a period not to exceed six months. Pursuant to the Non-compete Agreement, the Company has agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in the TSG business, and pursuant to which OnX has agreed, subject to certain limitations, to not engage, directly or indirectly, in certain business activities that would compete with the Company's Hospitality Solutions Group or Retail Solutions Group businesses.
Finally, MAK Capital and its affiliates, shareholders of the Company who collectively owns approximately 31% of the Company's outstanding common shares, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of authorizing the TSG Sale.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company also announced on May 31, 2011 that Martin F. Ellis is stepping down as president and chief executive officer to pursue other career interests. Mr. Ellis will continue to serve as a director and special advisor to the chairman until the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders to facilitate the transition of his responsibilities to his replacement. Mr. Ellis will receive severance benefits pursuant to his Change of Control Agreement and a separation agreement entered into with the Company.
The Company announced that James H. Dennedy, age 45, was appointed to serve as interim president and chief executive officer of the Company, effective immediately, for a one-year term. Mr. Dennedy has served as a director of the Company since June 2009 and will continue to serve as a director. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Dennedy was principal and chief investment officer with Arcadia Capital Advisors, LLC, an investment management company making active investments in public companies, since April 2008. Prior to that, he served as president and chief executive officer of Engyro Corporation, an enterprise software company offering solutions in systems management, from January 2005 to August 2007. Mr. Dennedy previously served as a director of Entrust, Inc., I-many, Inc. and NaviSite, Inc.
Mr. Dennedy's annual salary will be $350,000 and his fiscal year annual incentive opportunity will be $350,000. He will receive 42,000 restricted shares, which will be granted after the closing of the TSG Sale. In connection with Mr. Dennedy's appointment, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dennedy whereby he will be paid one year of his current base salary and continuation of one year of his health and welfare benefits upon termination without cause or a substantial change to his responsibilities or compensation prior to his one year employment anniversary. Mr. Dennedy also will receive travel and housing assistance. His employment agreement contains provisions for the protection of the Company's confidential information for an indefinite period and non-compete and non-solicitation clauses for a one-year period post termination.
Additionally, the Company intends to file a proxy statement in connection with its 2011 annual meeting and intends to include therein a proposal recommended by the board of directors to amend the Company's Code of Regulations to reduce the required size of the board from a range of nine to eleven directors to a range of three to nine directors and, if such proposal is approved by the Company's shareholders, to reduce the number of board classes from three to two. If shareholders approve both of these proposals, then shareholders will be asked to re-elect seven directors to the board, and Messrs. Commes and Knicely will not stand for re-election at the annual meeting. If shareholders do not approve both a reduction in the required number of directors and a reduction in the number of board classes, then the board will continue with three classes, and Messrs. Commes and Knicely will stand for re-election at the annual meeting.

Many important factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those in forward-looking information including, without limitation, competitive factors, disruption of supplies, changes in market conditions, pending or future claims or litigation, or technology advances. No assurances can be provided as to the outcome of cost reductions, expected benefits and outcomes from our recent ERP implementation, business strategies, future financial results, unanticipated downturns to our relationships with customers and macroeconomic demand for IT products and services, unanticipated difficulties integrating acquisitions, new laws and government regulations, interest rate changes, consequences related to the concentrated ownership of our outstanding shares by MAK Capital, unanticipated deterioration in economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world or the consequences, and uncertainties associated with the proposed sale of the Company's TSG business to OnX Enterprise Solutions, including uncertainties related to the anticipated timing of filings and approvals relating to the transaction, the expected timing of completion of the transaction and the ability to complete the transaction. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking information even if events make it clear that any projected results, actions, or impact, express or implied, will not be realized.
Other potential risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those in forward-looking information are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Item 1A, "Risk Factors." Copies are available from the SEC or the Agilysys website.
In connection with the proposed transaction, the Company will file a proxy statement with the SEC. INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND THE COMPANY. You will be able to obtain the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about the Company, free of charge, at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

The Company and its directors and officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company's shareholders with respect to the special meeting of shareholders that will be held to consider the proposed transaction. Information about the Company's directors and executive officers and their ownership of the Company's common shares is set forth in the proxy statement for the Company's Annual Meeting of shareholders, which was filed with the SEC on June 25, 2010.

The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties made by the Company and OnX to, and solely for the benefit of, each other. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure letters provided by the parties to each other in connection with the signing of the Purchase Agreement. While the Company does not believe that these disclosure letters contain information that the securities laws require the parties to publicly disclose, other than information that has already been so disclosed, they do contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in the Purchase Agreement. You should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company or OnX, since they were only made as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure letters. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and OnX rather than establishing matters as facts. Finally, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the companies' public disclosures.

The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to determine based solely on the provisions of this Section 1.04 and the submissions of Purchaser and Seller, and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and only as to whether: (i) such amounts were arrived at in conformity with the Accounting Standards and Section 1.04(a) hereof; (ii) the Closing Date Working Capital Statement contains mathematical errors on its face and/or (iii) the underlying amounts used to calculate the Closing Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement were incorrect.

The Closing Date Working Capital Statement, (A) as submitted by Purchaser if no timely Seller's Objection has been given, (B) as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or (C) as determined pursuant to the decision of the Accounting Firm, as the case may be, is herein referred to as the ""

(d) If the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: (i) if the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date set forth in the Final Working Capital Statement (the "") is less than the Estimated Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital; (ii) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital but less than or equal to the Target Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be increased dollar for dollar by the amount the Final Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital; and (iii) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be increased dollar for dollar by the amount the Purchase Price was decreased pursuant to Section 1.04(a). If Target Working Capital is less than Estimated Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: (i) if the Final Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, the Share Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount the Target Working capital exceeds the Final Working Capital and (ii) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, there shall be no adjustment of the Share Purchase Price. Any adjustments to the Share Purchase Price made pursuant to this Section 1.04(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, within five (5) business days after the issuance of the Final Working Capital Statement.

In the case of Existing Proceedings, the Indemnifying Party shall assume control of the settlement or defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim at its expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes or is required to assume control of such defense, each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense thereof, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, in the case of Existing Proceedings, at the Indemnifying Party's expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control the defense at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The party controlling such defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed control of the defense, then the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, agree to any settlement of such action, suit or proceeding that does not include a complete release of the Indemnified Party or that obligates the Indemnified Party in any manner other than for Damages to be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
CLEVELAND  May 31, 2011  Agilysys, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGYS), a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, announced today that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its $474 million-revenue Technology Solutions Group (TSG) business for a purchase price of $64 million to OnX Enterprise Solutions. OnX is a leading IT solutions provider based in Toronto, Canada, focused on designing and delivering mission-critical data center solutions. OnX, founded in 1983, has been recognized as one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies as well as one of the Top 75 Best Workplaces. The transaction is subject to approval by Agilysys shareholders and is expected to close in the Company's fiscal 2012 second quarter, which ends September 30, 2011.
The Board also announced that Martin Ellis, the architect of Agilysys' multi-year restructuring, will be stepping down as president and chief executive officer to pursue other career interests. Ellis will continue to serve as special advisor to the Board's non-executive chairman, Keith Kolerus, in support of the Company's transition until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held July 28, 2011. James H. Dennedy, a member of the Board, has been appointed as interim president and CEO.
Going forward, Agilysys will focus on three key objectives:
 
 
 
"The Company intends to achieve its objectives through a tighter coupling and management of the operating expenses of the businesses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities with the highest return. We will address the growth opportunities by utilizing our distinctively new, industry-specific enterprise applications being deployed across our growing marquee customer base in the global hospitality markets, and leveraging our market-leading solutions in the grocery, chain drug, and general and specialty retail segments," Dennedy said.
Sale of TSG and Distribution of Proceeds
"Following a comprehensive strategic review by our Board of Directors, we determined it was in the best interest of our shareholders to monetize the value of TSG and operate a more focused and higher-margin business," Ellis said.
"Improving operating performance and returning capital to shareholders will be our top priorities for how we think about using the cash on hand. To that end, the priorities for the use of cash will be funding our working capital needs, making select investments in the businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders as prudently as possible," Dennedy said.
 
TSG is a leading IT solutions provider focused on enterprise-class, multi-vendor, data center solutions to medium and large enterprises in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. For more than 25 years, TSG has been delivering unsurpassed value to its clients in these areas. Based on TSG's unaudited revenues of approximately $474 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, TSG accounted for approximately 70% of Agilysys' consolidated sales.
The agreement to sell TSG to OnX Enterprise Solutions for $64 million in cash is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined as of close, as well as certain customary closing conditions, including shareholder approval. The Company does not expect to pay taxes on the proceeds. Shareholders are encouraged to review the preliminary proxy materials related to the proposed transaction which the Company plans to file as soon as practicable following this announcement. BofA Merrill Lynch served as financial advisor and Jones Day served as legal counsel to Agilysys in connection with the transaction.
"The combination of OnX and TSG will create North America's leading IT solutions provider focused solely on providing mission-critical, multi-vendor data center solutions to medium and large enterprises," said Sheldon Pollack, co-founder and Director of OnX Enterprise Solutions. "The combined organization will have annual revenues in excess of $700 million and will be ideally positioned to serve customers with requirements on both sides of the border. We look forward to welcoming TSG's employees, partners and customers to the OnX family and continuing TSG's 25-year tradition of technical excellence and market-leading customer service."
Agilysys Strategic Direction and Business Performance
Following the close of the transaction, Agilysys will continue to operate as a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. The remaining business  consisting of the Company's existing Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) and Retail Solutions Group (RSG)  specializes in market-leading point-of-sale, property management, inventory and procurement, and mobile and wireless solutions that are designed to streamline operations, improve efficiency and enhance the consumer's
 
experience. Agilysys will continue to operate extensively throughout North America, with additional sales and support offices in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Agilysys' fiscal 2011 unaudited revenues from HSG and RSG were in excess of $200 million, with a combined gross margin of approximately 38%. "Both HSG and RSG have newly released technology. This new technology, along with our goal to achieve a more tightly focused strategy and improved alignment of operating expenses, gives me confidence in the Company's ability to deliver improved operating and financial results, profitably grow the businesses, and return significant capital to our shareholders," Dennedy said.
In fiscal 2011, HSG unaudited revenues increased approximately 12%. Growth in verticals such as food service, higher education, cruise lines and restaurants resulted in a broader customer base for HSG. The business's top two customers for fiscal 2011 were from outside the gaming industry, its historical core market. Other recent developments include the signing in May 2011 of a new contract in excess of $1 million involving three casinos; recent contract signings for Guest 360  Agilysys' leading-edge property management system  with several boutique hotels and casinos; and a new contract with a major food service customer in China as the business continues to expand in international markets.
RSG also continues its strategic growth, highlighted by the recent signing of the largest multi-year contract in its history, worth more than $40 million over the next 24 months. In addition, RSG's mobile point-of-sale system recently was approved by two major specialty retailers; a major supermarket chain has engaged RSG for a comprehensive new point-of-sale solution project; and RSG replaced a competitor in one of the largest convenience store franchises in the United States.
In April, both RSG and HSG were recognized with the IBM Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Solution Provider Excellence Award, marking the 16
th
consecutive year that the Company has received the award.
 
CEO Leadership Transition and Succession Planning
Ellis, 46, was appointed president and chief executive officer and elected to the Agilysys Board of Directors in October 2008. He joined the Company in 2003 as executive vice president for corporate development and investor relations, and became chief financial officer and treasurer in 2005. Prior to joining Agilysys, Ellis was senior vice president and principal at New York-based Stern Stewart & Co., a global financial consulting firm, where he served as financial advisor to Pioneer-Standard Electronics, the predecessor company of Agilysys.
In his eight years at Agilysys, Ellis played a pivotal role in leading the Company through numerous acquisitions and realignments during challenging market conditions, as well as a protracted proxy contest. During his tenure, the Company strategically transformed itself from an undersized distributor with limited growth opportunities to a leading provider of higher-margin innovative IT solutions. The sale of TSG is the capstone step in this long-term strategic transformation.
"We appreciate all of Martin's contributions to Agilysys as he demonstrated tremendous leadership and financial skills, along with a strong commitment to creating shareholder value, and helped guide the Company through extremely challenging times," said Keith M. Kolerus, non-executive chairman. "Martin will play an important role to ensure a seamless transition, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."
Dennedy, 45, was appointed to the Company's Board of Directors in June 2009. He served on the audit committee and on the Company's special committee that oversaw the sale of TSG. Prior to his appointment as the interim President and CEO, Dennedy was a principal and chief investment officer of a New York-based hedge fund focused on small and microcap investments. Prior to that, Dennedy was president and chief executive officer of Engyro Corporation, an enterprise software company that provided IT systems management interoperability solutions. He served as a public company director at NaviSite, Inc., where he was chair of the audit committee and a member of the compensation committee. He also was a director of I-many, Inc., and Entrust, Inc.
 
"Jim has extensive operational, capital market and mergers and acquisitions experience. His corporate experience, specific familiarity with the needs of Agilysys and leadership skills uniquely qualify him to serve as CEO during this transition period," Kolerus said. "He will lead our ongoing efforts to resize the Company and align our resources and operations to optimize efficiencies and growth in the hospitality and retail markets."

Dear Colleagues:
I want to share some important news with you.
As you'll see in the attached news release issued today, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell our TSG business to OnX Enterprise Solutions (www.onx.com). We are pleased to have a strong buyer in OnX for TSG. With more than 25 years in the business, OnX Enterprise Solutions is a leading IT solutions provider focused on designing and delivering mission-critical data center solutions. OnX clearly recognizes the intrinsic value of TSG. The combination provides a great opportunity for TSG to accelerate its transformation into a multi-vendor, customer-focused solutions provider as part of a larger organization when combined with OnX.
This transaction, which is expected to close during our fiscal second quarter ending September 30, 2011, will allow Agilysys to focus its energy and resources entirely on the Company's growth prospects as a leading provider of proprietary software, services and solutions to the high-margin hospitality and retail industries.
Agilysys will continue to specialize in market-leading point-of-sale, property management, inventory and procurement, and mobile and wireless solutions that are designed to streamline operations, improve efficiency and enhance the consumer's experience. The Company plans to take full advantage of its current financial and market strength and new technology solutions to accelerate growth in the hospitality and retail solutions businesses.
In addition, as announced in the release, I have decided to step down as president and CEO of Agilysys. I will remain as special advisor to our Board chairman, Keith Kolerus, until our annual meeting of shareholders on July 28. Jim Dennedy, a current member of our Board of Directors, will become interim president and CEO. Jim has served on our audit committee and the special committee that oversaw the sale of TSG. He has specific familiarity with the needs of Agilysys to lead our ongoing efforts to optimize efficiencies and growth in the hospitality and retail markets.
The future for TSG and Agilysys is both promising and exciting. Jim and the management team will communicate with you in as timely a manner as possible regarding further developments in the organizational transition as the Company makes further progress with its more tightly focused growth strategy. As always, I thank you for your hard work and dedication in helping create value for our shareholders, customers and suppliers.

Dear TSG Colleagues:
We are writing to provide you with some additional information about this morning's announcement regarding Agilysys' agreement to sell TSG to OnX Enterprise Solutions ().
www.onx.com
First and foremost, we assure you that the decision to enter into this transaction was not made lightly by the Board. Thanks to your hard work, TSG has been transformed into an integrated solution provider with a strong customer-centric business model since Agilysys acquired the companies that make up the business today. After a comprehensive strategic review of the entire business, the Board determined that the sale of TSG at this time is the best way to create additional value and meet our fiduciary duty to all Agilysys shareholders. We are pleased to have a strong buyer in OnX for TSG. OnX is a leading IT solutions provider based in Toronto, Canada, with offices in the United States and Europe. OnX, founded in 1983, has been recognized as one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies as well as one of the Top 75 Best Workplaces. OnX is focused on designing and delivering mission-critical data center solutions with time-tested technical and business acumen and a unique vendor-neutral approach that ensures unbiased solution design.
In making this acquisition, OnX clearly recognizes the intrinsic value of TSG, and we expect this transaction to further enhance TSG's ability to thrive financially and operationally in a rapidly changing marketplace. We are confident that the two businesses are highly complementary, with a similar business strategy, shared values and a culture focused on exceptional customer value.
Because this transaction is subject to shareholder approval, we will continue to manage and operate the TSG business as part of Agilysys until the transaction is completed, which we expect will happen in our second quarter which ends September 30, 2011. In the meantime, we encourage all of you to stay focused on the task at hand  providing great solutions to our customers.
Over the coming weeks, we will be providing you with additional information regarding this proposed ownership transition as it becomes available, and you will be meeting with your supervisors to discuss the transition in more detail. There will be a TSG conference call today at 1pm EST to introduce OnX, which can be accessed by dialing 1-866-843-0890, passcode 1257323#.
On behalf of the Board and the management team, we sincerely thank you for your unwavering dedication to growing the business and for helping to make this transition a seamless one for TSG and its customers.

[OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]
 
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Ellis, President and CEO of Agilysys. Mr. Ellis?
MARTIN ELLIS:
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we announced that Agilysys has entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Technology Solutions business to OnX, a leading IT solutions provider. If you haven't seen our news release announcing the agreement, you can find it on our website.
Also, as noted in the release, I have decided to step down as president and CEO, and Jim Dennedy, a current member of our Board of Directors, will assume the role of interim president and CEO. In a few minutes, Jim will speak to you about Agilysys and its strategy and opportunities going forward.
Jim and I wanted to take this time to speak to you directly about why we made the decision to sell TSG.
As you know, the mandate of our Board of Directors is to act in the best interests of all shareholders by reviewing and evaluating strategic alternatives on a regular basis. Following a comprehensive strategic review, our Board determined that monetizing the value of TSG would be the best way to unlock additional value for Agilysys shareholders and allow Agilysys to move forward as a more tightly focused and higher-margin business serving the hospitality and retail industries.
Having pursued a comprehensive sale process, we have agreed to sell TSG to OnX for $64 million in cash. The purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment and we do not anticipate having to pay tax on the proceeds. As result, following the close of the transaction, Agilysys will be debt-free and we expect to have in excess of $120 million in cash on hand. Jim will discuss use of proceeds further.
 
The sale requires the approval of two-thirds of our shareholders. MAK, our largest shareholder, owns approximately 31% of the outstanding shares, and will be voting in favor of the sale of TSG to OnX. We expect the transaction to close during our second quarter ending September 30, 2011.
As a result of this transaction, the ongoing business, with revenues in excess of $200 million, and gross margins of approximately 38%, will be very well positioned to leverage its growth as a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries.
While the Company will be focused on exciting opportunities going forward, I am confident that TSG's 25 years of successfully delivering unsurpassed service to customers will continue with OnX. We believe we found a very strong and strategic buyer in OnX, and this will further enhance TSG's ability to thrive in a rapidly changing marketplace. OnX is a leading IT solutions provider focused on designing and delivering mission-critical data center solutions, and it clearly recognizes the intrinsic value of TSG, including its talented professionals. This is a tribute to all of the employees who have built the business into what it is today. The outlook is bright for both TSG and the remaining hospitality and retail businesses.
As I mentioned earlier, after eight years and several multi-year restructuring efforts, I am stepping down as president and CEO, but will continue to serve as special advisor to our chairman, Keith Kolerus, until our annual shareholder meeting on July 28.
I would like to introduce you to Jim Dennedy, who will serve as interim president and CEO. Jim has been a member of our Board of Directors since 2009. He has served on the Board's audit committee and on the special committee that
 
oversaw the sale of TSG. Before taking on this new position with Agilysys, Jim was a principal and chief investment officer of a New York-based hedge fund focused on small and microcap investments. Prior to that, he was president and chief executive officer of Engyro Corporation, an enterprise software company that provided software solutions to help organizations reduce the cost of IT management.
Jim is very knowledgeable about our business and the industry, and he brings extensive experience in operations, capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.
JIM DENNEDY:
Thank you, Martin, and on behalf of the Board and everyone at Agilysys, I want to express our appreciation for all you have accomplished in your eight years with the Company.
I look forward to leading Agilysys through this important period, as we transition to a smaller but financially more flexible Company, and continue our strategic pursuit of value creation. Our Board believes that focusing all of the organization's energy and resources on the remaining business will enable the Company to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders, a stronger partner for our suppliers and a more dynamic environment for our personnel.
Following the divestiture of TSG, we will be able to devote all our resources to the higher-margin hospitality and retail solutions businesses. Profitable growth will be fueled by our newly released technology solutions, along with our more tightly focused strategy and improved alignment of operating expenses with the
 
businesses. I am confident in our ability to deliver improved operating and financial results, to grow the business profitably, and to return significant capital to our shareholders.
For our employees, I realize there may be uncertainties right now. Many decisions about the ongoing operations of TSG will be influenced by OnX, and, of course, we can't speak for them, but I know they are very focused on a smooth transition. I must remind everyone that we are limited by law in what we can say about the transaction because it still requires shareholder approval. As a result, we will not have a Q&A session after this call. We have, however, developed a written Q&A that will be filed as an 8K with the SEC and available to all for review.
As we move forward, we will focus on three key objectives:
 
 
 
We will achieve these objectives through a tighter coupling and management of the operating expenses of the business  and this means sharpening the focus of our spending to concentrate on growth opportunities that will bring the highest returns. To that end, we are in the process of developing a business plan to more efficiently address the opportunities available in the key markets our RSG and HSG businesses serve. This business plan will address not only investments in the business but also how we can reduce the corporate expense of servicing our businesses, including reducing our facilities' footprint.
In fiscal year 2011, which ended March 31, 2011, HSG unaudited revenues increased approximately 12%. Growth in verticals such as food service, higher education, cruise lines and restaurants resulted in a broader customer base for
 
HSG. In fact, its top two customers for fiscal 2011 were from outside the gaming industry, its historical core market. Other recent developments include the signing in May 2011 of a new contract in excess of $1 million involving three casinos; recent contract signings for Guest 360  Agilysys' leading-edge property management system  with several boutique hotels and casinos; and a new contract with a major food service customer in China as the business continues to expand in international markets.
RSG also continues its strategic growth, highlighted by the recent signing of the largest multi-year contract in its history, worth more than $40 million over the next 24 months. In addition, RSG's mobile point-of-sale system recently was approved by two major specialty retailers; a major supermarket chain has engaged RSG for a comprehensive new point-of-sale solution project; and RSG replaced a competitor in one of the largest convenience store franchises in the United States.
As I said earlier, I am confident in our ability to deliver improved operating and financial results, and these recent achievements are just a few examples of how we will continue to succeed going forward. As for use of cash, improving operating performance and returning capital to shareholders will be our top priorities for how we think about using the cash on hand. To that end, the priorities for the use of cash will be funding our working capital needs, making select investments in the businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders as prudently as possible.
I will now turn the call back over to Martin.
 
MARTIN ELLIS:
Thank you, Jim. During this transition period, we will continue to devote our efforts to providing the high level of service that all Agilysys customers and suppliers have come to expect. We will focus on ensuring a smooth transition for both TSG and Agilysys as we prepare for an exciting future as a focused hospitality and retail solutions business.
Thank you again for joining us on this conference call.

Exhibit 99.5
 
 
Following a comprehensive strategic review by our Board of Directors, with the assistance of our financial advisors, we determined it was in the best interest of our shareholders to monetize the value of TSG and operate a more focused and higher-margin business. We believe we have found a strong buyer for TSG that will further enhance its ability to thrive in a rapidly changing marketplace.
 
The purchase price is $64 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined as of close. Pending shareholder approval, the transaction is expected to close in the fiscal 2012 second quarter, which ends September 30, 2011.
 
OnX Enterprise Solutions Ltd. (www.onx.com) is a leading IT solutions provider focused on designing and delivering mission-critical data center solutions. Based in Toronto, Canada, and with offices in the United States and Europe, OnX is executing a strategy that is very similar to TSG's. This combination will expand TSG's market reach, and we expect this transaction to further enhance TSG's ability to thrive in a rapidly changing marketplace.
 
Agilysys will not have any ownership interest in TSG nor OnX. Under the agreement, Agilysys will provide certain IT and back-office transition services to OnX for up to six months during the integration of the two businesses.
 
The purchase price is $64 million in cash, and is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined as of close. We do not expect to pay income taxes related to the transaction.
Following the divestiture, Agilysys will have in excess of $120 million in cash on hand. Our priorities for the use of cash will be to fund working capital needs, make select investments to further our growth in the higher-margin hospitality and retail solutions business, and return excess cash to shareholders as prudently as possible.
 
BofA Merrill Lynch assisted the Board with its thorough review of all strategic alternatives available to drive shareholder value creation. They also provided a fairness opinion on the proposed transaction.
 
Jones Day is providing legal counsel to the Company on the transaction.
 
 
Pending shareholder approval, the transaction is expected to close in our fiscal 2012 second quarter, which ends September 30, 2011.
 
No approvals other than shareholder approval are required.
 
The transaction requires the approval of two-thirds of Agilysys' shareholders. Ohio law (the state where Agilysys is incorporated) requires us to obtain approval from shareholders for the sale of "all or substantially all" of our assets. While the statute does not define "all or substantially all" and, although we will be retaining ongoing businesses and assets after the proposed sale, various interpretations of the statute as applied to this transaction indicate that shareholder approval is required. The TSG business currently represents approximately 70% of the Company's total revenues. Regulations require the transaction to be approved by holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares.
 
Approval by the holders of two-thirds of the Company's outstanding shares is required for completion of this transaction.
 
Yes, a special meeting will take place at a date and time yet to be determined.
 
In connection with the proposed transaction, the Company expects to file a proxy statement as soon as practicable with the SEC and mail proxy materials to shareholders as soon as the proxy is approved. Investors are urged to read the proxy statement when it becomes available because it will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the Company. We expect the vote to be finalized in the fiscal second quarter.
 
 
The remaining business will be a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions focused on the hospitality and retail industries. We believe that the Agilysys hospitality and retail businesses each possess unique market positions, intellectual property and skilled employees that will enable growth in existing and new customer accounts.
We will create shareholder value through our focused hospitality and retail business by improving the operating and financial performance of the businesses and making select investments that enhance our core offerings.
 
Businesses in retail and hospitality are increasingly turning to technology solutions to improve their customers' experience as well as manage inventory and run their operations more efficiently. Agilysys offers highly competitive and innovative solutions that satisfy the consumer's growing desire for convenience and add value to our customers' operations. Examples include Guest 360  Agilysys' leading-edge property management system  and RSG's mobile point-of-sale system, both of which have seen excellent growth in recent months. These capabilities position Agilysys well to take advantage of growth opportunities in areas such as retail stores, food-service management, chain hotels, stadiums and arenas and cruise lines.
 
Our first priority from an investor perspective is to create value through higher profitability and more consistent financial performance, by operating a more focused business that fundamentally derives value from intellectual property and marquee customers. With a heightened focus on delivering improved financial results and strong discipline around capital allocation, we believe investors will find this an intriguing and attractive investable story. We also believe that a focused business model will be more easily understood by a broader group of investors due to improved visibility between end market opportunities and financial performance.
 
Agilysys will retain its name and will remain a publicly listed NASDAQ company.
 
Following the transaction, we will have significant financial flexibility enabling us to pursue select business investments that could provide additional software functionality and an increased presence in international markets, provided the return on invested capital is attractive.
 
In fiscal year 2011, the continuing core businesses of Agilysys produced more than $200 million in revenue and achieved gross margins of approximately 38%. The continuing business plan includes an initiative to more closely align the operating expenses of the business with the specific requirements of the business units. Although we are not sharing specific targets at this time, we anticipate the business will substantially reduce its operating expenses over the 12 months following the close of the sale of TSG.
 
Following the transaction, Agilysys will have in excess of $120 million in cash on hand and will be debt-free.
 
MAK Capital will be voting in favor of the transaction with OnX.
 
Approximately 58% of shares not affiliated with MAK Capital will need to be voted in favor of the sale for approval.
 
 
By appointing an interim CEO, the Board has some time to evaluate the necessary and most appropriate qualifications for the future CEO while rapidly moving the business through the transition resulting from this transaction. At this time, the Board has determined that Dennedy is the right person to lead the Company through this transition. As the transition of the business nears completion, the Board will re-evaluate the leadership needs that most directly align with the Company's significant future prospects.
 
It was both a Board decision and a personal decision for Dennedy to take on this role. Leading a business in transition is a role he is familiar with and one that he has proven he can successfully navigate for the benefit of the business and shareholders. Dennedy sees significant opportunities to capture value for shareholders through development and implementation of tighter and more focused plans for the businesses. He understands the current interim nature of the role, as it is defined, and looks forward to working with the Board to specify the needs for the future CEO role. He intends to compete for that role, provided it is consistent with his skills, that he believes he can continue to add value, and that it is consistent with his professional career objectives.
 
 
The Board regularly evaluates alternatives to increase shareholder value through strategic transactions versus executing against the operating plans of the business. That said, the press release and this Q&A piece reflect the Board's collective and united view that the Company's transition to a more focused and efficient business model is the current, best available option to enhance shareholder value.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
CLEVELANDJune 14, 2011Agilysys, Inc. , a leading provider of innovative IT solutions, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2011.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fourth-Quarter 2011 Unaudited Results of Operations
Fourth-quarter consolidated sales increased 5.8% to $143.8 million, compared with $135.8 million in the final quarter of fiscal 2010. Net revenues grew 16.5% and 8.7% in the Company's Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG) and Technology Solutions Group (TSG), respectively, more than offsetting a 13.6% decline in its Retail Solutions Group (RSG).
Gross margin contracted to 25.3% of sales, compared with 26.4% of sales in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Margins were negatively impacted during the quarter due to lower services margins and vendor rebates.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $44.8 million for the quarter, an increase of $2.9 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.
During the quarter, the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded certain goodwill and intangible assets related primarily to its TSG business segment were impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $37.7 million during the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter.
The reported operating loss for the quarter, which included the impairment charge and $0.8 million in restructuring charges, was $46.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA (operating loss plus depreciation and amortization), excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, from continuing operations was a loss of $5.1 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $2.9 million a year ago (see table attached).
The net loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $45.0 million, or a loss of $1.97 per diluted share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $0.5 million, or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.
James Dennedy, interim president and chief executive officer, commented: "Looking ahead to fiscal 2012, we are optimistic that the decisions and actions taken subsequent to the March fiscal yearend will enhance shareholder value. After the proposed divestiture of the TSG segment is completed, Agilysys will have two industry-leading businesses that will serve as a solid platform for profitable future growth.
"A major theme of the ongoing restructuring is to tighten our cost controls and better align corporate functions with our operating businesses. To that end, today we also announced that the Board of Directors has approved a restructuring plan, as well as the relocation of the Company's corporate functions from Solon, Ohio, to Alpharetta, Ga., during fiscal 2012."
Fiscal 2011 Unaudited Results of Operations
Full-year revenue in fiscal 2011 increased 6.5% to $675.5 million from $634.3 million in fiscal 2010 due to improvement in customer demand and bundling more remarketed software with hardware purchases. Sales of hardware, software and services increased 4%, 23% and 7%, respectively, compared with the prior year.
Full-year gross profit declined 2.4% to $157.7 million, versus $161.5 million in fiscal 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 23.3% in fiscal 2011, compared with 25.5% last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by lower vendor rebates and services margins.
SG&A expense increased 3.6% to $173.2 million, compared with $167.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation, Guest360
TM
development costs that were capitalized in fiscal 2010 and higher costs associated with the Company's ERP implementation in fiscal 2011.
Including the aforementioned asset impairment and restructuring charges, the operating loss for the year was $54.4 million, compared with the operating loss of $6.8 million in fiscal 2010. Charges related to restructuring and asset impairment totaled $38.9 million in fiscal 2011, versus $1.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, was a loss of $1.9 million for fiscal 2011, compared with a positive $10.1 million a year ago (see table attached).
The fiscal year 2011 net loss from continuing operations was $55.5 million, or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $3.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, last year.
Liquidity
Cash on hand grew $8.8 million during the year, reaching $74.4 million at the end of fiscal 2011 due to lower investments in working capital. The Company remains debt free, except for certain capital leases.
Business Outlook
Management indicated that, at this time, it is not prepared to provide guidance for fiscal 2012. As soon as practicable after the close of the proposed TSG transaction, the Company intends to provide estimates regarding the cost of restructuring, as well as the expected impact of the restructuring on fiscal 2012's anticipated results.
The Company plans to file its Form 10-K with the SEC later today.

On August 1, 2011, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") terminated its Loan and Security Agreement among the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries, and Bank of America, N.A., dated May 5, 2009 ("Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provided $50 million (permitting an increase to $75 million by a $25 million "accordion provision") of credit for borrowings and letters of credit and was due to mature on May 5, 2012. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the Company will owe no penalties for early termination. As a result of the proceeds the Company received from the sale of its Technology Solutions Group business segment ("TSG"), the Company determined that it no longer required the liquidity provided by the Credit Facility.
 
On July 28, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved the sale of TSG. On August 1, 2011, the Company completed its sale of TSG to OnX Acquisition LLC and OnX Enterprise Solutions Limited (with OnX Acquisition LLC, "OnX") for a purchase price of $64 million, subject to a possible downward adjustment based on final working capital. The sale was completed in accordance with that certain stock and asset purchase agreement among the Company, Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC, and OnX, dated May 28, 2011.
As previously reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 31, 2011, the Company agreed to sell to OnX all of the outstanding stock or equity of (i) Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC, (ii) Agilysys Canada, Inc., and (iii) Agilysys Europe Technology Solutions Limited, and Agilysys Technology Solutions Group, LLC sold certain of its intangible assets to OnX Enterprise Solutions Limited.
Reference is made to the news release attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 99.

For revenue goals, to receive a threshold payout of 1% of the target incentive, achievement of at least 87.51% of the performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 118.75% of the performance measure is required. For gross profit goals, to receive a threshold payout of 25% of the target incentive, achievement above 80.1% of the performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 115% of the performance measure is required. For cash/EBITDA goals, to receive a threshold payout of 50% of the target incentive, achievement of 80% of the
performance measure is required, and to receive a maximum payout of 250%, achievement of 150% of the performance measure is required.
Fiscal Year 2012 Long-Term Incentives
The Compensation Committee also approved fiscal year 2012 long-term incentive awards ("LTIs") for the Company's named executive officers, as follows:
 
The LTIs consist of 50% stock-settled stock appreciation rights ("SSARs") and 50% restricted shares, based on the values set forth above ("Value"), and will be granted under the Company's 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"). To comply with the Company's policy of not granting equity during a closed trading window period, the grant date will be the day that is two business days after the release of the Company's quarterly earnings for the fiscal year first quarter. The number of SSARs and restricted shares granted to each named executive officer will be determined by dividing the respective Value by the fair market value of the Company's common shares on the grant date, and the exercise price for the SSARs will be equal to the fair market value of Company's common shares on the grant date, such SSARs and restricted shares to vest ratably over a three-year period, one-third per year on each of March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, pursuant to an award agreement, provided such executive officer remains employed by the Company. The number of SSARs and restricted shares granted on the grant date will be disclosed on a Form 4 filed with the SEC for each named executive officer within two business days of the grant date.

As such, no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plans, and awards previously granted under the Prior Plans will be settled pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the respective Prior Plan under which each award was granted.

Exhibit 99
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELANDAug. 1, 2011Agilysys, Inc., a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced that the sale of its Technology Solutions Group (TSG) business unit has been completed. In addition, Agilysys' Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1.6 million common shares, or approximately 7% of the Company's outstanding shares.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Interim President and Chief Executive Officer James Dennedy commented: "Agilysys is sufficiently capitalized with ample cash and no debt. Today's adoption of the share repurchase program reflects the Board's commitment to prudently return capital to shareholders. Cash also will be used for both working capital purposes and to make select investments in the business, while improving operating and financial performance. We believe this approach offers the greatest opportunity for increasing shareholder value."
TSG Close
On May 31, 2011, the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its TSG business for $64 million in cash to OnX Enterprise Solutions; the transaction was approved by Agilysys shareholders on July 28, 2011. OnX will assume management of the former TSG operations including all North American and European operations. OnX is a privately held company and majority owned by Marlin Equity Partners of Los Angeles, CA.
"Agilysys is pleased to have completed the sale of TSG. We wish our colleagues transitioning to OnX all the best and we thank them for their years of service to Agilysys. Since the announcement of the sale, we developed and have begun executing a plan to restructure and relocate corporate closer to the businesses," added Dennedy.
"Looking forward, Agilysys will focus on its faster growing and higher margin businesses, emphasizing unique solutions that represent state-of-the-art IT applications in the hospitality and retail sectors."
Share Repurchase Program
The Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.6 million common shares. The share repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements.
The share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company. Unless renewed, the share repurchase program will expire on March 31, 2012.
"We are pleased to announce the intent to repurchase up to 1.6 million Agilysys common shares. The Board of Directors prudently evaluated the attributes of the Company's shareholder base, the fact that the Company terminated its secured line of credit as part of the divestiture of TSG and alternative uses of cash to determine the optimal amount of capital to return to shareholders," Dennedy said.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CLEVELANDAug. 9, 2011Agilysys, Inc., a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2012 first quarter ended June 30, 2011.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
First-Quarter 2012 Unaudited Results of Operations
First-quarter consolidated sales increased 15% to $151.6 million, compared with $131.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Net revenues grew 39% and 15% in the Company's Retail Solutions Group (RSG) and Technology Solutions Group (TSG), respectively, more than offsetting a 9% decline in its Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG).
Gross margins were 25.3% of sales, compared with 25.7% of sales in the fiscal 2011 first quarter. The gross margin contraction reflected lower service margins primarily in TSG.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $41.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.4 million from the prior year quarter due to higher compensation costs related to accelerated vesting of stock compensation and transaction expenses both related to the divestiture of TSG. On July 28, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved the sale of TSG and the transaction closed on August 1, 2011.
The reported operating loss for the three months narrowed to $5.4 million, compared with the operating loss of $6.6 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA (operating loss plus depreciation and amortization), excluding restructuring charges, was a loss of $0.5 million, compared with a loss of $2.7 million a year ago. (See attached table.)
The net loss for the quarter was $4.8 million, or a loss of $0.21 per share, versus the net loss of $10.3 million, or a loss of $0.45 per share, in the comparable prior-year period.
Restructuring Plan
As previously announced, Agilysys is sharpening its focus on its state-of-the-art proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. The Company indicated it has begun executing a plan that is expected to eliminate $14 million to $16 million of annualized expense beginning in fiscal 2013. The total restructuring charges to execute the plan are expected to be in the range of $16 million and $18 million, which will be primarily recorded in fiscal 2012.
Jim Dennedy, president and chief executive officer, commented, "With the sale of TSG complete, the reorganization of the business is accelerating. The quick pace and decisiveness with which our personnel have responded to these new challenges gives me confidence in our success. We strongly believe in the availability of a substantial market opportunity in hospitality and retail. We intend to invest in the business and products to capitalize on the opportunity and profitably grow the business. We believe this plan represents the best use of cash and the greatest likelihood of increasing shareholder value."
Liquidity
Cash on hand was $51.7 million at June 30, 2011, and Agilysys remains debt free, except for certain capital leases. In conjunction with the closing of the TSG divestiture on August 1, 2011, the Company terminated its credit facility and announced a 1.6 million-share-repurchase authorization.
The Company plans to file its Form 10-Q with the SEC later today

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CLEVELANDNov. 9, 2011 Agilysys, Inc., a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter and first half ended September 30, 2011. As previously announced, Agilysys closed the sale of its Technology Solutions ("TSG") business on August 1, 2011, and accordingly, TSG's operating results, including the gain on the sale, as well as its assets and liabilities, are reported as components of discontinued operations.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Fiscal 2012 Second-Quarter Unaudited Results of Continuing Operations
Consolidated revenue increased 8.6% to $53.6 million in the second quarter, compared with $49.3 million in last year's comparable quarter. Revenue from the Company's Hospitality Solutions Group grew by 10.0% over the prior year, and its Retail Solutions Group's revenues increased by 7.7%.
Gross margin increased sharply during the quarter to 40.3%, up from 36.0% in the second quarter of last year, due to higher services and hardware margins and a greater proportion of higher-margin proprietary software revenues.
Commenting on the results, James Dennedy, president and chief executive officer, stated: "Both operating segments generated higher sales and gross margins during the quarter. This reinforces our strategy of deriving a higher proportion of revenue from proprietary services and software solutions."
SG&A expenses declined as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter to 45.6%, compared with 49.4% in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses totaled $24.5 million, up from $24.3 millionprimarily due to $1.4 million in accelerated depreciation related to assets associated with the facility the Company is vacating in Solon, Ohiooffset by cost reductions initiated in the last several quarters.
Dennedy added: "We are making good progress with the transition of corporate services to Georgia and the realignment of the organization. Upon completion of the restructuring, we expect to reduce annual costs by approximately $14 million to $16 million, and enhance our position to exploit opportunities we see in the hospitality and retail markets."
The Company reported an operating loss for the quarter of $5.2 million, which included $2.4 million in restructuring charges, versus the operating loss of $6.7 million in last year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization), excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, was $1.0 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $4.0 million in the prior-year second quarter. (See reconciliation below.)
 
Agilysys reported a net loss from continuing operations of $3.2 million, or a loss of $0.14 per share, for the second quarter, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $4.9 million, or $0.22 per share, in the previous year's quarter.
Fiscal 2012 First-Half Unaudited Results from Continuing Operations
Consolidated sales in the first half of fiscal 2012 increased 11.8% to $107.5 million, compared with the $96.1 million reported in the first half of fiscal 2011.
Gross margin was essentially unchanged at 38.3% in the first half, compared with 38.2% in fiscal 2011's first six months.
SG&A expenses increased nominally to $48.6 million, from $47.5 million, due to accelerated depreciation related to assets located at the Company's corporate headquarters and higher stock compensation related expenses driven by the sale of the Company's TSG business.
For the six-month period, the Company reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, compared with an operating loss of $11.2 million in the first half of the prior fiscal year. Year to date, adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, was a loss of $1.2 million, versus a loss of $5.5 million in the first half of the prior year. (See reconciliation below.) For the first half of fiscal 2011, the net reported loss from continuing operations was $8.7 million, or a loss of $0.38 per share, versus the previous year's net loss from continuing operations of $13.2 million, or a loss of $0.58 per share.

On December 9, 2011, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as its independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to dismiss E&Y was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and recommended by its Audit Committee. On December 9, 2011, the Company appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.
At the direction of the Audit Committee, the Company conducted a competitive process to determine the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the remainder of the Company's 2012 fiscal year. The Company invited several global accounting firms to participate in this process. As a result of this process and following careful deliberation, the Board of Directors approved the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm based upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee.
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 and the subsequent interim period through December 9, 2011, the Company had (i) no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, any of which that, if not resolved to E&Y's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of any such disagreement in connection with its reports for such years and interim period and (ii) no reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K during the two most recent fiscal years or the subsequent interim period.
E&Y's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 do not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor are qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 and the subsequent interim period through December 9, 2011, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with PwC regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, (iii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, or (iv) any reportable event within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The Company provided E&Y with a copy of the disclosures it is making in this Current Report on Form 8-K prior to filing with the SEC and requested that E&Y furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether E&Y agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter, dated December 13, 2011, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(e) Each such Committee may prescribe such rules as it shall determine for calling and holding meetings and its method of procedure, subject to the provisions of this Section and any rules prescribed by the Board of Directors.
. The compensation of the Directors shall be such as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

Section 1
 
. Each person who is or was a Director, Officer, Employee or Agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, Employee, Trustee or Agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be indemnified by the Corporation as follows:
Section 1
(a) If such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of his being or having been such Director, Officer, Trustee, Agent or Employee, such person shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; provided the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contenders or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding shall also not create a presumption that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful; or
(b) If such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of his having been such Director, Officer, Trustee, Agent or Employee, such person shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of either (i) any claim, issue or matter to which such person is adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Common Pleas or the court in which such action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Common Pleas or such other court shall deem proper or (ii) any action or suit involving a Director in which the only liability asserted against such director is pursuant to Section 1701.95 of the Ohio Revised Code.
. To the extent that such a Director, Officer, Trustee, Agent or Employee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 1 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding.
Section 2
 
. In all cases in which the Director, Officer, Trustee, Agent or Employee may be entitled to indemnification under Paragraphs (a) or (b) of Section 1 of this Article, any indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, Officer, Trustee, Employee or Agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the standards of conduct set forth in Paragraph (a) or (b) of Section I of this Article, whichever is applicable. Such determination shall be made as follows:
Section 3
(a) By a majority vote of a quorum of the Corporation's Directors who were not and are not parties to or threatened with any such action, suit or proceeding; or
(b) if such a quorum is not obtainable or if a majority of a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, in a written opinion by independent legal counsel other than an attorney or a firm having associated with it an attorney who has been retained by or who has performed services for the Corporation or any person to be indemnified within the past five (5) years; or
(c) By the shareholders; or
(d) By the Court of Common Pleas or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought.
Any determination made by the disinterested Directors under Paragraph (a) or by independent legal counsel under Paragraph (b) of Section 3 of this Article shall be promptly communicated to the person who threatened or brought the action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation, if the expenses for which indemnification has been sought were incurred in an action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation.
. In the case of an action, suit or proceeding involving a Director, unless the only liability asserted against such Director in a proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Section I of this Article is pursuant to Section 1701.95 of the Ohio Revised Code, the Corporation shall pay expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by a Director in defending such an action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director in which such Director agrees to both (i) repay such amount if it is proven by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the Corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard to the best interests of the Corporation, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Corporation concerning the action, suit or proceeding.
Section 4
. The Corporation may pay expenses, including attorney's fees incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 1 of this Article as they are incurred in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Trustee, Director, Officer, Employee or Agent to repay such amount if it ultimately is determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Section 5
 
. The rights of indemnification herein authorized shall be severable, shall not be deemed exclusive of, and shall be in addition to, any other rights granted to those seeking indemnification under the Articles of Incorporation or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to actions in the official capacity of the person seeking indemnity, and as to actions in another capacity while holding such office and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, Trustee, Agent or Employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 6
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection, including but not limited to, trust funds, letters of credit or self-insurance, on behalf of or for any person who is or was a Director, Officer, Employee or Agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, Trustee, Employee or Agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under this Article. Insurance may be purchased from or maintained with a person in which the Corporation has a financial interest.
Section 7
. The Corporation's authority to indemnify persons pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 1 of this Article does not limit the payment of expenses as they are incurred, indemnification, insurance or other protection that may be provided pursuant to Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this Article; paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section I of this Article do not create any obligation to repay or return payments made by the Corporation pursuant to Sections 5, 6, or 7 of this Article.
Section 8
. As used in this Article, references to "Corporation" include all constituent corporations in a consolidation or merger and the new or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a Director, Officer, Employee or Agent of such a constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a Director, Officer, Trustee, Employee or Agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under this Article with respect to the new or surviving corporation as he would if he had served the new or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
Section 9
. The provisions of this Article shall apply to actions, suits and proceedings, whether civil (including, but not limited to, actions by or in the right of the Corporation), criminal, administrative or investigative, commenced or threatened after the adoption of this Article, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after its adoption.
Section 10
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by the Ohio Revised Code, as amended from time to time, indemnify and reimburse all persons whom it may indemnify and reimburse pursuant thereto. The indemnification provided for in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those entitled to
Section 11
 
receive indemnification or reimbursement hereunder may be entitled under the Articles of the Corporation, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by the Directors of the Corporation.

The following information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
On February 9, 2012, Agilysys, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal 2012 third quarter ended December 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. A copy of the slide presentation for the earnings webcast conference call is also attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
(d) Exhibits
The following item is furnished as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ATLANTAFeb. 9, 2012Agilysys, Inc., a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2012 third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2011. As previously announced, Agilysys closed the sale of its Technology Solutions Group ("TSG") business on August 1, 2011, and accordingly, TSG's operating results, including the gain on the sale, as well as its assets and liabilities, are reported as components of discontinued operations.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Summary Fiscal 2012 Third-Quarter Unaudited Financial Results From Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
Summary Fiscal 2012 Nine-Month Unaudited Financial Results From Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
President and CEO James Dennedy commented: "The Company recorded four percent more in gross profit on lower overall revenues and $3 million more in adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. In the quarter, Hospitality and Retail experienced lower hardware revenue; while Hospitality experienced growth in proprietary support and Retail experienced growth in proprietary services. For the nine months, hardware remained essentially flat and software revenues were down; however, both proprietary services and proprietary support are up, reflecting an improved revenue mix in Retail and more subscription-based sales in Hospitality. The revenue and gross profit performance reflects the business strategy emphasis on improving overall revenue quality and acquisition of recurring revenue streams. The adjusted EBITDA performance reflects ongoing expense management initiatives, and we remain on plan to achieve the guidance issued earlier this year."
"We have made significant progress in moving our corporate services from Solon, Ohio, to Alpharetta, Georgia," added Robb Ellis, the Company's chief financial officer. "As we have shifted to more of a software-based company over the past year, we have also transformed and dramatically improved our corporate services team to comply with the needs of the business. This will allow us the ability to provide greater insight to the business to assist in our growth initiatives, provide more efficient and streamlined policies and procedures across the Company, and provide our investors with increased visibility into the Company."
Ellis continued, "During the third quarter, we identified errors in the approach the Company was taking in recognizing revenue for certain software license and service arrangements in prior periods. We concluded these errors were not material to any previously issued financial statements or to this fiscal year and therefore revised previously issued fiscal year 2012 financial statements to correct the effect of these errors and have included errors associated with periods prior to fiscal year 2012 in our first quarter fiscal 2012 financial statements. We have included these adjustments as one-time items in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included in this release."

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ATLANTAJune 7, 2012Agilysys, Inc., a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2012.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
To align with the company's strategic restructuring, revenue and cost of goods sold are now being reported in three categories: Products; Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services; and Professional Services. In addition, operating expenses are now differentiated in the following subcategories: product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Finally, operating results from the company's former Technology Solutions Group (TSG), including the gain on its sale, as well as its assets and liabilities, are reported as components of discontinued operations.
Summary Fiscal 2012 Fourth-Quarter Unaudited Financial Results From Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary Fiscal 2012 Full-Year Unaudited Financial Results From Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
"During fiscal 2012, we successfully repositioned the company by divesting the lower-margin TSG business and focusing on our core competencies in the hospitality and retail industries," stated President and CEO James Dennedy. "We have essentially completed the restructuring and have better aligned cost structure with continuing operations, implemented procedures to increase accountability and enhanced the corporate services team. At the same time, we returned capital to shareholders with the repurchase of 1.6 million shares during the year. Entering the new fiscal year, Agilysys is a leaner company with a flatter organizational structure and two solid growth platforms on which to build."
Chief Financial Officer Robb Ellis commented, "Cash from continuing operations was very strong for the quarter and full year. Adjusted for non-recurring cash expenses related to restructuring and BEP/SERP payments, cash generated from continuing operations for fiscal 2012 increased to $16.2 million, compared with $4.6 million in cash used for continuing operations in the prior year.
"Despite using significant amounts of cash for share repurchases, restructuring charges and divesture expenses, the company's financial condition and liquidity remain robust. We are debt free and held $97.6 million in cash and equivalents at year end, providing sufficient financial strength to execute our refined strategy."
Outlook
"As a result of the shift away from lower-margin hardware revenue," Ellis added, "we anticipate less seasonality and overall volatility in future financial results. Moreover, with improved processes and procedures, our visibility into the business has been enhanced, allowing us to provide better and more detailed guidance."
The company indicated that in fiscal 2013 it expects revenue to be between $208 million and $211 million. Adjusted operating income is expected to be in a range of $3.5 million to $4.5 million, reversing the $7.9 million adjusted operating loss in fiscal 2012. Full-year adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to improve from the $0.32 loss reported for fiscal 2012 to positive earnings per diluted share of between $0.16 and $0.21 in the current year.

ATLANTAJuly 26, 2012
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
Summary Fiscal 2013 First-Quarter Unaudited Financial Results From Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Entering fiscal 2013, we continued to make significant progress transitioning our business model to higher-quality and recurring revenue streams to produce more consistent and sustainable growth," commented President and CEO James Dennedy. "Revenues from Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services, combined with Professional Services, grew 12%, nearly offsetting the 14% decline in Products revenue during the quarter. We remain keenly focused on high-quality revenue opportunities in the high-end segments of the markets we serve. Over time, our focus on high-quality products, services, markets and revenue will result in a growing, profitable business that will outperform the market."
 
Chief Financial Officer Robb Ellis added, "Our business returned to profitability during the quarterbefore non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, and excluding one-time charges such as restructuring. In addition, we are pleased by the significant margin expansion generated during the first quarter, despite it traditionally being a seasonally weak period. This improvement reflects and reinforces our strategy of emphasizing marketing efforts on higher margin implementations, subscription and support services, which are less commoditized and offer a greater value proposition for our customers. As a result, our confidence in the projected results for the year continues to improve and we are reaffirming our previously stated guidance."
Outlook
The Company is reaffirming previous guidance for fiscal 2013 as follows:
Full-year consolidated revenue is expected to be between $208 million and $211 million. Adjusted operating income is anticipated to be in a range of $3.5 million to $4.5 million, reversing the $7.9 million adjusted operating loss in fiscal 2012. Full-year adjusted net income per share is anticipated to improve from the $0.39 loss reported for fiscal 2012 to positive adjusted net income per diluted share of between $0.16 and $0.21 in the current year.

AGILYSYS, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER REVENUE GROWTH OF 30% AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS OF $0.08 PER DILUTED SHARE AND GAAP EARNINGS OF $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE
- Raises Fiscal 2013 Guidance -
Alpharetta, GA -January 31, 2013 -
Agilysys, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
, a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today reported operating results for its fiscal 2013 third quarter ended December 31, 2012, and raised its revenue and adjusted operating income forecast for the full year.
Summary of Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Financial Results
James Dennedy, President and CEO of Agilysys, commented, Our operating results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflect our expectations from the strategic initiatives implemented in the middle of fiscal 2012. Our personnel have eagerly embraced our strategy and as a result, we are delivering increased quality to our customers and value to our shareholders. Our success to date with the Companys refocused business strategy is reflected in the growth of our Hospitality business, which continues to outpace growth in the overall industry, and in our ability to optimize the strong cash flow generated by our Retail business.
Notwithstanding the progress made to date, we are still in the early stages of executing the refocused business strategy. We believe our emphasis on pursuing higher quality, recurring revenue opportunities and serving markets that place a premium on using technology to deliver a higher quality customer experience will produce above-market returns for our shareholders. Our approach to implementing this strategy will provide a more innovative place for our people to develop their careers and add more value to the solutions our customers receive from Agilysys. In future periods, we believe our operating leverage will continue to improve; recurring revenue, as a percentage of our overall business, will increase; product development investments will provide new innovation enabling our customers to grow their business; and our team will further improve upon the industry-leading customer service for which Agilysys is known.

Summary of Fiscal 2013 First Nine Months Financial Results
Robb Ellis, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, added, We are pleased with the solid results we have generated and believe we have attractive opportunities to continue improving the business over the long term. Our results continue to reflect a good balance of current quarter performance and the prudent long-term investments we are making in the business. With nearly $80 million in cash and no debt, Agilysys has a solid balance sheet and the financial flexibility to support our goal of generating consistent profitable revenue growth while investing in our business to address new growth opportunities. Based on the success of the quarter and visibility into the year, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 guidance which reflects strong revenue growth and a return to profitable operations relative to fiscal 2012.
Raises Fiscal 2013 Outlook
The table below compares the Companys updated guidance to its prior guidance for fiscal 2013 and to the reported results for fiscal 2012:

However, under certain circumstances, the Company may respond to and pursue an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal.

The Purchase Agreement further provides that, upon a termination in certain specified circumstances relating to Acquisition Proposals, the Company may become obligated to pay Buyer a termination fee of $2,000,000 and reimburse expenses up to $1,250,000.
The closing of the RSG Sale is subject to certain conditions and is expected to occur in the Companys fiscal second quarter, which ends September 30, 2013.
The Purchase Agreement contains certain post-closing covenants, including that (i) for a period of four years after the closing of the RSG Sale, the Company will not install or support point of sale systems and related mobility solutions in, or sell any product or service sold by the RSG Business prior to the closing date to, certain categories of retail businesses, anywhere in the United States and Canada, and (ii) for a period of four years after the closing of the RSG Sale, neither the Company nor Buyer will solicit the employment of any employees of the other party or their affiliates.

(i)
    
No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate, substantially in the form of and determined in accordance with Exhibit C, reasonably acceptable to Buyer, of Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the 
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement
), together with the detailed work papers which support the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement. The Closing Payment shall be (A) decreased by the amount, if any, by which Working Capital as shown on the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement (the 
Estimated Working Capital
) is less than the Target Working Capital, or (B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital.
(ii)
    
Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a statement of Working Capital as of the Effective Time, substantially in the form of and determined in accordance with Exhibit C (the 
Closing Date Working Capital Statement
), together with reasonable documentation, which shall (x) set forth any adjustments to Estimated Working Capital as shown on the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement, and (y) be prepared from the books and records of the Business. The Seller and its independent public accountant (
Sellers Accountant
) shall make available (a) all of their work papers and other relevant documents related to the Business in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement to Buyer and its independent public accountant (
Buyers Accountant
), and (b) upon reasonable request relevant persons who are knowledgeable of the matters required to prepare the Closing Date Working Capital Statement for reasonable inquiry by Buyer and Buyers Accountant.
(iii)
    
If the Seller objects to any amounts reflected on the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the Seller must, within thirty (30) days after the Sellers receipt of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, give written notice (the 
Working Capital Dispute Notice
) to Buyer specifying in reasonable detail the objections of the Seller, including its alternative statement substantially in the form of and determined in accordance with Exhibit C of Working Capital as of the Effective Time. If the Seller fails to timely deliver a Working Capital Dispute Notice, Buyers determination of Working Capital as of
13
the Effective Time as set forth in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. Any disputes with respect to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.9(a)(iv).
(iv)
    
If, within the objection period afforded to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(iii), a Working Capital Dispute Notice is delivered by the Seller to Buyer, representatives of the Parties shall negotiate in good faith during the twenty (20) day period (the 
Working Capital Resolution Period
) after the date of Buyers receipt of the Working Capital Dispute Notice to resolve any disputes. If the Parties are unable to resolve all such disputes within the Working Capital Resolution Period, then at any time thereafter, either Party may require that the disputes be submitted to Deloitte LLP (the 
Independent Accountant
), which action shall be triggered by the requesting Party providing written notice to the other Party. The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert, and not an arbitrator, and shall be engaged to provide a final and conclusive resolution to all unresolved disputes specifically referred to it relating to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement within a reasonably prompt time frame after such engagement, which resolution shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement; provided, that if the Independent Accountant finds the provisions of this Agreement (including Exhibit C hereto) are not sufficient to resolve any issue or issues, the Independent Accountant shall rely upon GAAP as applied in the Financial Statements. Each Party agrees to execute any reasonable engagement letter requested by the Independent Accountant. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties hereto, absent manifest error, and the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne based upon the degree to which the Independent Accountant accepts the respective positions of the Parties. For example, if it is Buyers position that the adjustment owed is $300, the Sellers position that the adjustment owed is $100 and the Independent Accountants finding that the adjustment owed is $150, then Buyer shall pay 75% (300-150 / 300-100) of the Independent Accountants fees and expenses and Seller shall pay 25% (150-100 / 300-100) of the Independent Accountants fees and expenses. The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 2.9(a) for resolving disputes relating to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving such disputes;
provided, however,
that the Parties agree that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Independent Accountant in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be enforced.
(v)
    
Upon the final, binding and conclusive determination of Working Capital as of the Effective Time, whether by agreement between the Seller and Buyer or as provided in Section 2.9(a)(iii) or Section 2.9(a)(iv) (such final, binding and conclusive amount, 
Final Working Capital
), the Parties shall determine the amount (the 
Final Closing Payment
) equal to the Closing Payment (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(i)) minus, if applicable (A) the amount by which Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, or plus, if applicable, (B) the amount by which Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital.
14
(vi)
    
If the Final Closing Payment is greater than the Adjusted Closing Payment, then, on or before the fifth (5
th
) Business Day after the determination of Final Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If the Final Closing Payment is less than the Adjusted Closing Payment, then, on or before the fifth (5
th
) Business Day after the determination of Final Working Capital, the Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If the Final Closing Payment equals the Adjusted Closing Payment, then neither Party shall be obligated to make any payment to the other Party under this Section 2.9(vi). If Buyer or the Seller fails to pay when due any amount payable under this Section 2.9(vi), then Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, shall be obligated to and shall reimburse the other Party for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by the other Party of its rights under this Section 2.9(vi). Any amounts due from one Party to the other and not timely paid shall in addition bear interest at an annual rate of 6%, compounded monthly and based on a 365 day year.
2.10
    
Allocation of Purchase Price
.
(a)    Buyer and Seller agree that for purposes of calculating the initial amount of any transfer Tax imposed by the state of South Carolina in connection with this Agreement the allocation of Purchase Price (i) to the Tangible Personal Property shall be equivalent to the fair value of such Tangible Personal Property as set forth in
Schedule 2.1(a)
and (ii) to the Inventory, which is being purchased for resale, shall be equivalent to the fair values therefor as set forth on the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement. Following the determination of the Final Working Capital, for purposes of calculating the final amount of any transfer Tax imposed by the state of South Carolina in connection with this Agreement the allocation of Purchase Price to the Tangible Personal Property and Inventory shall be equivalent to the fair values therefor as reflected in the calculation of Final Working Capital, if any such fair values are different than the fair value determined pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 2.10(a). Buyer and Seller will be liable for any such Transfer Taxes as provided in Section 2.12.
(b)    Within ninety (90) days after the determination of the Final Working Capital, Buyer shall provide to Seller a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price among the asset classes (the 
Allocation Schedule
) determined in accordance with section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and the principles established on
Schedule 2.10
. The Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding on the Parties unless, within thirty (30) days after delivery thereof, Seller delivers a written notice to the Buyer of its reasonable objections to the Allocation Schedule. If Seller does not object to the Allocation Schedule within the applicable period or the Parties otherwise come to an agreement with respect to all such objections, such Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding on the Parties (the 
Final Allocation Schedule
). The Parties agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objections. If the Parties are not able to agree upon the Allocation Schedule, then the Allocation Schedule shall be determined by the Independent Accountant, based upon the relative fair market value of the Assets. The cost of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the Parties. The Parties and their Affiliates agree that each will (i) be bound by the Final Allocation Schedule for the purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii)
15
report for Tax purposes the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule, (iii) timely file a copy of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 with its appropriate federal and other Tax Returns, and (iv) not take any Tax position that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any taxing authority. In the event that the Final Allocation Schedule is disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify the other Parties, and the Parties will consult in good faith how to resolve such dispute in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule. The Final Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted in accordance with the determination of the Final Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the allocation of Purchase Price to the Tangible Personal Property and Inventory set forth in the Final Allocation Schedule shall be the respective amounts set forth in Section 2.10(a).
2.11
    
Transfer of Assets and Assumed Liabilities
. In the event that the legal interest in any of the Assets, Assumed Contracts or Assumed Liabilities to be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed pursuant to this Agreement, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed hereunder as of the Effective Time because any waiting or notice period has not expired or any consents or approvals required for such transfer have not been obtained or waived, then the legal interest in the Assets, Assumed Contracts or Assumed Liabilities shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed. The Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining such consents or approvals as may be necessary to complete such transfers as soon as practicable.

ERISA and Employee Benefit Matters

(a)
    
Schedule 3.21(a)
describes all Plans which are provided by the Seller to, for the benefit of, or relate to, any Business Employee. The items described in the foregoing sentence are hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as 
Employee Plans/Agreements
 and each individually as an 
Employee Plan/Agreement
. A copy of each of the Employee Plans/Agreements has been furnished or made available to Buyer, along with related summary plan descriptions, any determination or opinion letter issued to the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate with respect to any of the Employee Plans/Agreements. No Employee Plan/Agreement is a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA), and the Seller has never contributed nor been obligated to contribute to any such multiemployer plan. The Seller has furnished Buyer with respect to each Employee Plan/Agreement the three most recent annual reports prepared in connection therewith (Form 5500 including all schedules thereto) or, if an Employee Plan/Agreement has been in existence for less than two (2) years, the annual report prepared for each
28
year such Employee Plan/Agreement has been in existence. For purposes of this Agreement, an 
ERISA Affiliate
 is any trade or business whether or not incorporated that together with Seller would be deemed a single employer within the meaning of ERISA section 4001 or affiliated with Seller within the meaning of section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
Code
).
(b)
    
Each Employee Plan/Agreement that is an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(2) of ERISA that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer), each related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption.
(c)
    
Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has ever maintained, contributes or has ever contributed to or is or has ever been obligated to contribute to, any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

Such offers may be contingent upon such Business Employees satisfactorily meeting Buyers normal screening and hiring practices and procedures (including, without limitation, I-9 forms, drug testing and background checks). The Seller will cooperate with the Buyer in its efforts to hire such individuals. The employment of any Business Employee who accepts Buyers offer and is hired by Buyer (

Seller shall retain exclusive responsibility for and shall satisfy any retiree medical or life insurance benefits payable under any Seller Plan.
(c)
    
Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for Hired Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents prior to the Effective Time.

In any such case, all of the provisions of this Section 8.1 with respect to Hired Employees who become such as of the first day following the Closing Date shall apply
mutatis mutandis
to such Non-Active Employees who become employees of Buyer during such period, in which case such Non-Active Employees shall become and be deemed Hired Employees for all purposes of this Agreement;
provided
, that all determinations that are made as of the Effective Time or the Closing Date as herein above set forth in this Section 8.1 which are applicable to Hired Employees who become such as of the first day following the Closing Date shall instead be made, with respect to each such Non-Active Employee who so becomes a Hired Employee, as of the first day that each such Non-Active Employee so becomes a Hired Employee.

WARN Laws
).
(i)
    
No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person or organization, including without limitation employees or former employees (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, unions or other representatives of such employees or former employees, or trustees, administrators, participants, or beneficiaries of any Plan, and no provision of this Agreement shall create such third-party beneficiary rights in any such person or organization in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Plan, including the currently existing Employee Plans/Agreements. No provision in this Agreement is intended to or shall be deemed to amend, modify, or establish any Plan that is currently or may in the future be sponsored, maintained, or contributed to by the Buyer or its Affiliates.
(j)
    
Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be construed to limit the right of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries to amend or terminate any plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan. Except as provided in Section 8.1(g), n
othing in this Agreement is intended to require Buyer to continue the employment of any Business Employee for any period of time or to limit the right of Buyer to terminate the employment of any Business Employee at any time for any reason or for no reason.

Terminated Contracted Business Employee
), the Seller agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any non-competition provisions of the Employment Agreement for such Terminated Contracted Business Employee to be assigned to the Buyer (such document effecting the assignment being a 
Non-Compete Assignment
) and, if applicable, to exercise, in connection with such termination, the Sellers option to extend any non-competition provisions of the Employment Agreement of such Terminated Contracted Business Employee as provided therein;
provided
that in no instance shall the Seller be obligated to pay any amount for the exercise of such option and Buyer agrees that it shall be solely responsible, and shall indemnify Seller, for any such amount. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) Seller shall not be required to remit any funds or pay any amounts to the Terminated Contracted Business Employee in connection with the assignment
45
or under the terms of the Non-Compete Assignment (other than any severance or other payment obligations Seller may have to such Terminated Contracted Business Employee under the respective Employment Agreement), and (ii) Seller otherwise shall have no liability to (x) any Terminated Contracted Business Employee with respect to the assignment of the non-compete or under the terms of the Non-Compete Assignment (other than any severance or other payment obligations Seller may have to such Terminated Contracted Business Employee under the respective Employment Agreement) or (y) Buyer in connection with the assignment or under or with respect to the terms of the Non-Compete Assignment.

Alpharetta, GA  June 3, 2013 -
Agilysys, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
, a leading developer and marketer of proprietary enterprise software, services and solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Retail Solutions Group (RSG) to an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. (Clearlake) for total consideration of $34.55 million in cash, subject to customary closing conditions.
Following completion of the proposed transaction, expected to occur later this summer, Agilysys business will be focused exclusively on providing software enabled solutions to the hospitality industry. The Company estimates that, as of the closing, it will have approximately $110 million in cash and cash equivalents, representing approximately $4.90 per common share outstanding, and no debt. The Company believes its strong balance sheet and positive adjusted operating income positions it to execute on growth initiatives in the hospitality industry. Through continued investments in new product development as well as potential acquisitions, the Company expects to grow its business, add to its solutions portfolio and deliver above market returns to shareholders.
James Dennedy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Agilysys, commented, The sale of the RSG business is consistent with our corporate strategy of pursuing the highest return on capital opportunities available to the Company for the benefit of our employees, customers and shareholders. Looking forward, we expect Agilysys to generate positive adjusted operating income with above market growth from its hospitality focused business.
Mr. Dennedy added, The RSG business contains a talented team of people and leadership offering compelling solutions to the retail industry. The transaction provides the business and the team access to greater capital to pursue the growth initiatives available in the retail market. Clearlake is a great partner to help grow the business, further develop the team, and serve the RSG customers.
 
We are excited to invest in RSG, a clear market leader with strong customer relationships, as we provide new capital to accelerate growth, said Behdad Eghbali, a founding partner at Clearlake. We view RSG as a strong platform with talented leadership that is well-positioned to benefit from significant market trends, including retailers continuing investment in information technology to enhance the customer experience. We look forward to supporting management as they build on RSGs track record of delivering exceptional value to customers.
Additional Financial and Reporting Details
Agilysys will report financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2013, on June 12, 2013. On January 31, 2013, Agilysys provided fiscal 2013 financial guidance, inclusive of
Retail contributions, for revenue of $230-$232 million, adjusted operating income of $6.0-$6.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.24-$0.26.
Agilysys expects to record a one-time restructuring charge of less than $1.0 million related to the sale of RSG in its fiscal 2014 and does not expect to pay income taxes on the proceeds of the sale.
The estimated $110 million of cash and cash equivalents at closing is based on the forecasted value of cash on hand as of the closing, plus the net proceeds from the RSG sale transaction, less restructuring related cash expenses.

Agilysys, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AGYS)
, a leading developer and provider of innovative information technology, services and solutions for the hospitality industry, today reported operating results for its fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2013.
On June 3, 2013, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to divest its Retail Solutions Group (RSG) to an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P., for total cash consideration of approximately $34.55 million, subject to customary closing conditions.

Following the completion of the proposed transaction, and accounting for the acquisition of the assets of TimeManagement Corporation announced earlier this week, Agilysys will have approximately $108 million in cash and cash equivalents, representing approximately $4.80 per common share outstanding, and no debt. Going forward, Agilysys will focus exclusively on providing innovative software enabled solutions to the hospitality industry.
Summary of Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Summary of Fiscal 2013 Full Year Financial Results
James Dennedy, President and CEO of Agilysys, commented, Our operating results for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full year outperformed our plan and highlight the Companys successful execution of our strategy. This success is evident in the continued growth of our Hospitality segment where total revenue, recurring revenue and gross margin increased year over year, and where our growth continues to outpace the overall market rate of growth. In addition, we expect the solid growth in hospitality product sales achieved in fiscal 2013 to help drive additional growth in fiscal 2014. We expect this growth to be fueled by continued and substantial investment in our product development initiatives, supplemented by select acquisitions. Our strategy and investment activity remains focused on advancing our product roadmap, capturing new market opportunities, increasing the value proposition to our customers and promoting an innovative professional environment to recruit, grow and retain the brightest minds and most customer-focused professionals in our industry.
Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to divest our RSG business in order to further focus on growing our market share and expanding our higher-margin recurring revenue opportunities in the hospitality industry. Over the last two years, Agilysys hospitality industry customer base has steadily increased. We have the financial strength, clear strategy, product development initiatives and team-wide commitment to drive consistent market share growth through further improvements in our solutions and industry-leading customer service. Our focus on delivering value-creating technology solutions and services that enable hospitality operators to improve their guests on-site experience, grow retention rates and increase wallet share continues to resonate with current and potential customers and will result in our ability to grow the business faster than the market rate of growth in our industry and deliver increased value for our shareholders.
Robb Ellis, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, added, Our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial results reflect both the continued growth in our business as well as our ongoing investments in new product development that we expect will position Agilysys for consistent, long-term growth. Following the completion of the proposed transaction to divest Retail, and accounting for the acquisition of the assets of TimeManagement Corporation announced earlier this week, Agilysys will have approximately $108 million in cash, or approximately $4.80 per share, and no debt. With this healthy financial position and our disciplined focus on capital allocation, we are confident Agilysys can successfully execute on our goals of generating profitable revenue growth while strategically investing in the future of our business.
Mr. Ellis continued, For fiscal 2014, we expect to again achieve above market revenue growth and to generate positive adjusted operating income for the full year, while continuing our strategic initiatives in product and corporate development.
