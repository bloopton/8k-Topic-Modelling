-2- ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS On February 6, 2003, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") purchased all of the membership interests of Kar Products, LLC ("Kar") from GC-Sun Holdings II, L.P. ("GC-Sun"), and Barnes Group Canada Corp., a Canadian subsidiary of the Company ("Barnes Canada"), purchased certain assets and the business of, and assumed all of the liabilities (other than certain environmental and tax liabilities) of, A. & H. Bolt & Nut Company Ltd. ("A&H Bolt"). GC-Sun and A&H Bolt are affiliates of Glencoe Capital Partners II, L.P. ("Glencoe"). The Company's purchase of the Kar membership interests (the "US Acquisition") and Barnes Canada's purchase of the A&H Bolt assets and assumption of the A&H Bolt liabilities (the "Canadian Acquisition") were consummated pursuant to the terms of that certain Membership Interest and Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 15, 2003, by and among the Company, Barnes Canada, Kar, A & H Bolt, GC-Sun, A & H Bolt Holdings, Inc., GC-Sun, Inc., GC-Sun G.P. II, Inc., GC-Sun G.P., Inc. and GC-Sun Holdings, L.P. (the "Purchase Agreement"). The aggregate purchase price for the US Acquisition was US $74.5 million, and the aggregate purchase price for the Canadian Acquisition was US $4.0 million plus the assumption of the liabilities of A&H Bolt assumed by Barnes Canada. The aggregate purchase price is subject to adjustment upward and downward based upon any difference between $29.1 million and the consolidated net worth of Kar and A&H Bolt as of February 5, 2003, determined in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price was determined through negotiations conducted on an arms' length basis between the Company, Kar, A&H Bolt, GC-Sun and Glencoe. During such negotiations, the parties considered, among other things, the business and operations of Kar and A&H Bolt, their customer, vendor and employee relationships, the condition of their assets, their respective financial condition, the market for their services and their future business prospects. Prior to the commencement of negotiations, there was no material relationship between the parties or their respective affiliates, directors, officers or associates. The purchase price for the US Acquisition was satisfied by: (i) the issuance by the Company to GC-Sun of 923,506 shares of common stock of the Company, and (ii) the payment by the Company of cash of US $56,000,000 which was funded with proceeds from borrowings by the Company under its revolving credit agreement with eleven (11) banks led by Fleet Bank. The purchase price for the Canadian Acquisition was paid by Barnes Canada from existing cash resources. The Company granted certain registration rights to GC-Sun for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of the shares of common stock issued to it in the US Acquisition. The assets of Kar and those of A&H Bolt that were the subject of the Canadian Acquisition consisted primarily of inventory, agreements with customers, vendors and employees, trademarks and the goodwill associated therewith, employee benefit plans, and real property leases. Neither the Company nor Barnes Canada acquired, directly or indirectly, title to any real property as part of either transaction. As part of the Canadian Acquisition, Barnes Group Canada has made employment offers to substantially all of the employees of A&H Bolt. Kar is in the business of the distribution of maintenance and repair parts, fasteners, electrical components, chemicals, fluid flow, tools and other related items (the "Business") in the
-3- United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The assets purchased from A&H Bolt in the Canadian Acquisition were used by A&H Bolt in the conduct of the Business in Canada. The Company intends, directly and through its subsidiaries, to continue to use the assets of Kar and A&H Bolt to conduct the Business. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (a) Financial Statements of Kar and for the acquired business of A&H Bolt will be filed by an amendment to this report, which amendment the Company expects to file on or before April 22, 2003.

Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements that, if adversely determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any claim that would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies, or material adverse effect upon the Seller Parties' ability to enter into or perform their obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to which any Seller Party is a party. 4.14.

Each US Plan has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and each of the Plans has been maintained and operated in material compliance with its terms. (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(f), the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement (alone or together with any other event) will not (i) entitle any Person to any benefit or payment under any US Plan (including without limitation bonus, golden parachute, retirement, severance, employment compensation, or other benefit or enhanced benefit), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation or other benefit due to any Person under any US Plan, (iii) entitle any employee to any job security or similar benefit or any enhanced benefits, or (iv) result in the payment or series of payments by either Company to any Person of an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

The Sellers and Parents agree and acknowledge that remedies at law for any breach of their obligations under this Section 7.2(b) are inadequate and that in addition thereto the Buyers and the US Company shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction and specific performance, in the event of any such breach. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 7.2(b) to the contrary, nothing herein shall prevent any party hereto from disclosing such information as it deems necessary or advisable in connection with the enforcement by such party of any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.2(b), Sellers shall be permitted to retain a copy of each of the Shared Records for use by Sellers as Sellers may reasonably require, and Buyers shall be permitted to use the copies of the books and records of the Canadian Company included in the definition of Canadian Assets for use by the Buyers as Buyers may reasonably require.

Limited and each of its other subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit for employment any officer, director or employee of, or encourage any officer, director or employee to leave his or her employment with, the US Company, Canadian Buyer, the Barnes Distribution division of the US Buyer or any of their respective successors, or (ii) solicit or intentionally induce any customer, supplier, lender or lessor to discontinue or reduce the extent of his, her or its business with the US Company, Canadian Buyer, the Barnes Distribution division of the US Buyer or any of their respective successors (except that covenants under this Section 7.2(c)(ii) shall not prohibit C&J Fasteners, Inc., Brafasco Holdings, Inc., or Brampton Fastener Co. Limited in the conduct of their businesses using those types of sales channels as -54-
they used in the conduct of their businesses over the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date). (d) No Competition. Sellers and Parents each agree that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, no Seller, Parent or any of their subsidiaries shall have any interest, either directly or indirectly, in any entity, whether as shareholder (other than the ownership of less than ten percent (10%) of the stock of a publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market), partner, member, manager, independent contractor, consultant, agent, principal, franchisee, franchisor, creditor, officer, director, employee, individual owner or proprietor, or otherwise, either on behalf of such Seller or Parent or on behalf of any other Person, that engages, either directly or indirectly in the Business; provided, however, that the Sellers and Parents or any of their Affiliates shall be permitted to retain their ownership interests in C&J Fasteners, Inc., Brafasco Holdings, Inc., and Brampton Fastener Co. Limited provided C&J Fasteners, Inc., Brafasco Holdings, Inc., and Brampton Fastener Co. Limited only conduct their business using those types of sales channels as they have used in the conduct of their businesses over the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date. The restrictions in this Section 7.2(d) shall apply to a geographic region that coincides with the North American-wide scope of the Business. (e) Remedies Upon Breach. The Sellers and the Parents each hereby acknowledge and agree that a material breach or threatened breach thereby of any of the provisions contained in this Section 7.2 will cause irreparable injury to the US Company and the Buyers. Sellers and Parents therefore agree that, in addition to any other right or remedy the Buyer Parties may have under this Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and to a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining or restraining the breach or threatened breach of this Section 7.2 by a Seller or Parent. The Sellers and the Parents further agree that the Buyer Parties shall have the right to have the provisions of this Section 7.2 specifically enforced. (f) Authority of the Court. Consistent with the intent of the parties, if it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that any covenant or agreement set forth in this Section 7.2, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified, and that any covenants and agreements not subject to judicial modification shall be given their full effect according to their terms. (g) Termination. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the provisions of Sections 7.2(c) and 7.2(d) shall terminate with respect to any Person otherwise bound thereby at such time as such Person ceases to be affiliated with Glencoe Capital, LLC. 7.3 Acquisition Bonuses. Sellers shall pay directly any bonuses to be paid to employees of the US Company in connection with completion of the transaction contemplated by -55-
this Agreement and shall hold Buyers and US Company harmless from and indemnify Buyers and US Company with respect to any Damages related to such bonuses (including, without limitation, failure of Sellers to pay such bonuses). 7.4 Certain Financial Information. The Seller Parties shall, at Buyer's expense and during reasonable business hours, provide the Buyers and their representatives with access to relevant books and records of the Sellers for, and cooperate with and assist the Buyers in, the preparation by Buyers of audited and unaudited financial and other information required for the preparation of selected and summary financial data and pro forma financial information regarding the business of the Companies for all periods ending prior to the Closing Date required by applicable provisions of Regulations S-X and S-K promulgated under the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and shall provide such management representation letters and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller Parties' outside independent public accountants to deliver such consents and comfort as are customary under applicable accounting standards, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than forty-five days following the request of Buyers therefore. The US Company and Canadian Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation of and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, review and audit of the financial statements of the Companies for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. 7.5 D&O Indemnitees. (a) The US Company shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Person set forth on Schedule 7.5 (collectively, the "D&O Indemnitees" and individually, a "D&O Indemnitee") from and against any and all Damages that arise out of, relate to or are in connection with the management or conduct of the business or affairs of the US Company or the D&O Indemnitees' activities with respect thereto, except for any such Damages that have resulted from willful misconduct or recklessness by the D&O Indemnitee seeking indemnification. (b) Nothing in clause (a) above shall limit the coverage of or otherwise be deemed to replace or be in lieu of any insurance otherwise available to any D&O Indemnitee. Any D&O Indemnitee shall make a good faith effort to recover any insurance proceeds that may be available to cover any Damages (including, without limitation, under the D&O Policy described in clause (d) below). The amount which the US Company is required to pay to, for, or on behalf of any D&O Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any insurance proceeds actually recovered by or on behalf of such D&O Indemnitee and other amounts paid by any person in reduction of the related Damages. If a D&O Indemnitee shall have received or shall have paid on its behalf any amounts in respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive directly or indirectly insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the US Company a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts provided the same does not exceed an amount equal to the payment actually made by the US Company under this Section 7.5. -56-
(c) Effective upon consummation of the Closing, the Buyer Parties, and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged the D&O Indemnitees of and from any and all Damages which the Buyer Parties, and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, or any of them, has or ever had, or hereafter can, shall or may have, arising out of the actions or inactions of any such D&O Indemnitees in their capacities as officers, managers or directors of the US Company; provided, however, that this Section 7.5(c) shall not apply to Damages that (i) arise from the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of any of the D&O Indemnitees, or (ii) may arise from the breach by any of the D&O Indemnitees of, or the failure to perform, any obligation or duty arising on the part of any of the D&O Indemnitees after the date hereof under this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any other agreement to be entered into after the date hereof and contemplated hereby to which any of the D&O Indemnitees is a party. (d) Sellers and the Parents, or any of them, shall purchase or otherwise have in place, effective as of the Closing, a policy or policies of insurance for errors and omissions of the D&O Indemnities in their capacities as officers and directors of the Companies prior to the Closing with limits of at least $3,000,000 (the "D&O Policy"). The D&O Policy shall be maintained by the Sellers and the Parents, or any of them, for a period of not less than six (6) years. The US Company shall be named as a named insured on a direct and primary basis under such D&O Policy. The D&O Policy shall be written such that the US Company will be notified by the insurer of the cancellation (including cancellation for non-renewal) or restrictive amendment of the D&O Policy at least thirty (30) days prior to the date that the cancellation or restrictive amendment takes effect. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing, Sellers shall provide the Buyers with certificates of insurance evidencing full compliance with the above insurance requirements. Such certificates will be kept current throughout the entire above-mentioned six (6) year period. Buyers' acceptance of such certificates shall not relieve Sellers and the Parents of the obligation to obtain and maintain the coverage set forth above, nor shall such acceptance be deemed a waiver of the US Company's and Canadian Buyer's right to such coverage. 7.6 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute such further documents and instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be requested by one or more of the other parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to vest the US Buyer with full title to the Interests, to vest the Canadian Buyer with full title to the Canadian Assets, to file all Tax Returns and make any elections related to Taxes, and to otherwise effect the purposes of this Agreement. Upon the reasonable request of the Canadian Buyer, the Seller Parties shall provide the Canadian Buyer with copies of any books or records of the Canadian Company related to the Canadian Assets or the business of the Canadian Company. 7.7 Agreement Regarding Company 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding Section 6.6(a), it is understood that it may not be commercially reasonable for the Seller Parties to cause the Kar Products LLC Savings and Investment Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to cover only employees and former employees of the Companies and their beneficiaries on the Closing. As a result, in the event employees and former employees of Affiliates of the Seller Parties, other than employees and former employees of the Companies (the "Non-Company Participants") -57-
participate in the Company 401(k) Plan on and after the Closing, Buyer and the Seller Parties shall cooperate and take such action as is necessary to spin-off the assets and liabilities of the Company 401(k) Plan relating to the Non-Company Participants, in accordance with Code Section 414(l), to a successor plan to be established by the Seller Parties or an Affiliate thereof (the "Plan Spin-Off") as soon as commercially reasonable following the Closing. Until the date of the Plan Spin-Off the Buyer shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to continue to receive contributions and administer the Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of the Non-Company Participants. It is specifically understood that after the Closing Buyer and Kar shall have no obligation to make contributions to the Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of any Non-Company Participant and that the Seller Parties and their Affiliates shall be fully responsible for all contributions for Non-Company Participants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the Companies shall have no obligation to allow Non-Company Participants to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan for payroll periods beginning 45 days after the Closing and the Plan Spin-Off shall be completed within 60 days after the Closing. Additionally, Seller Parties and their Affiliates shall pay and indemnify Buyer, the Companies and the Company 401(k) Plan for all costs and liabilities associated with covering Non-Company Participants, including but not limited to on-going administrative costs associated with providing such coverage, as well as the administrative, consulting and legal costs associated with the Plan Spin-Off. 7.8 Transition Services. Effective upon the Closing, the parties shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement, pursuant to which they shall each provide certain services for a specified period following the Closing and in consideration of the agreements, covenants and provisions contained herein. 7.9 Misdirected Receivables. From and after the Closing, Seller Parties shall remit promptly to Canadian Buyer any payments or other sums received by the Canadian Company for an account receivable of the Canadian Company that existed on or prior to Closing. ARTICLE 8 TAX MATTERS 8.1 Indemnity. (a) Subject to Section 11.6(f), the Sellers and Parents agree from and after the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Parties against the following Taxes (except to the extent reserves for such Taxes have been specifically established on the Closing Balance Sheets) and against any Damages incurred in contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes: (i) Taxes (but excluding any expenses incurred by Buyers in participation in any audit where Sections 8.4(b) and 8.4(c) specifically provides that such expenses of participation be paid by the Buyers) imposed on the Companies or any predecessor with respect to taxable periods of such Person ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, (A) Taxes imposed on the US Company which are allocable, pursuant to Section 8.1(b), to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date, and (B) all such Taxes imposed on the Canadian Company, except for Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the ownership or use of the Canadian -58-
Assets, then only such Taxes allocable, pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date; (iii) Taxes imposed on the Canadian Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) under any bulk transfer law of any jurisdiction or under common law doctrine of de facto merger or successor liability as a result of the purchase, use and operation of the Canadian Assets; (iv) Taxes imposed on any member of any affiliated group with which any of the Companies or any predecessor file or have filed a Tax Return on a consolidated or combined basis for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; and (v) Taxes imposed on the Buyer Parties as a result of any breach of warranty or misrepresentation under Section 4.9. The Buyers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parties for any Taxes of the Buyer Parties not allocated to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.1(a). (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, as provided under Section 8.7), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the real, personal or intangible property of the Companies, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days from the beginning of the period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. 8.2 Returns and Payments. (a) From the date of this Agreement through and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Entity (or cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the US Company that are due on or before or relate to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (and the Buyers shall do the same for the US Company with respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Tax Returns of the US Company not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the US Company (except to the extent counsel for the Sellers or the US Company renders a legal opinion that there is no reasonable basis in law therefore or determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed without being subject to penalties). With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by the Buyers or the Sellers with respect to the US Company and as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other party under Section 8.1(b), the filing party shall provide the other party and its authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to such other party pursuant to Section 8.1(b), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at -59-
least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and such other party and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior the filing of such Tax Return. (b) The Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable all Taxes with respect to the US Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, accrued for such Taxes as current Taxes payable on the Closing Balance Sheets (subject to Section 11.6(f)), and the Buyers shall so pay or cause to be paid Taxes for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (subject to its right of indemnification from the Sellers by the date set forth in Section 8.5 for Taxes attributable to the portion of any Tax period that includes the Closing Date pursuant to Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b)). 8.3 Refunds. Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to the US Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (except for any refund included on the Closing Balance Sheets, which shall be the property of the Buyers, and if paid to the Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to the Buyers) shall be the property of the Sellers (and not the US Company), and if received by the Buyers or the US Company shall be paid over promptly to the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to the Sellers through a reduction in Tax liability) for a period ending on or before the Closing Date arising out of the carryback of a loss or credit incurred by the US Company in a taxable year ending after the Closing Date shall be the property of the Buyers and, if received by the Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to the Buyers. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the US Company with respect to a taxable period that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date shall be equitably apportioned in a manner consistent with the liability to pay such Taxes pursuant to Section 8.1(a). 8.4 Contests. (a) After the Closing, each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall promptly notify the other in writing of any written notice of a proposed assessment, reassessment, or claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under this Article 8, provided, however, that a failure to give such notice will not affect the indemnified party's right to indemnification under this Article 8 except to the extent, if any, that, but for such failure, the indemnified party could have avoided all or a portion of the Tax liability in question. (b) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to the US Company that relates to periods ending on or before the Closing Date, provided that the Sellers acknowledge in writing their liability under this Agreement to hold the Buyers and the US Company harmless against the full amount of any adjustment which may be made as a result of such audit or proceeding that relates to periods ending on or before the Closing Date (or, in the case of any taxable year that includes the Closing Date, against an adjustment allocable under Section 8.1(b) to the portion of such year ending on or before the Closing Date), the Sellers shall have the right at their expense to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or -60-
proceeding but only to the extent that such audit or proceeding relates solely to a potential adjustment for which the Sellers have acknowledged their liability; the Buyers also may participate in any such audit or proceeding at their expense. If the Sellers do not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, the Buyers may defend the same in such manner as they may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving five days' prior written notice to the Sellers setting forth the terms and conditions of settlement (subject to Section 8.4(d)). In the event that issues relating to a potential adjustment for which the Sellers have acknowledged their liability pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) are required to be dealt with in the same proceeding as separate issues relating to a potential adjustment for which the Buyers would be liable, the Buyers shall have the right, at their expense, to control the audit or proceeding with respect to the latter issues. In such cases, Buyer and Seller will cooperate in deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (including, without limitation, choice of judicial forum). (c) With respect to issues relating to a potential adjustment in the Taxes of the US Company for which both the Sellers (as evidenced by their acknowledgment under this Section 8.4) and the Buyers or the Companies could be liable, (i) each party may participate in the audit or proceeding, and (ii) the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods. The principle set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall govern also for purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (including, without limitation, choice of judicial forum) in situations in which separate issues are otherwise controlled under this Article 8 by the Buyers and the Sellers. (d) Neither the Buyers nor the Sellers shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or proceeding with respect to the US Company which would adversely affect the other party for such year or a subsequent year without the written consent of the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyers and the Sellers agree to cooperate, and the Buyers agree to cause the US Company to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any audit or proceeding. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Canadian Company or Sellers shall solely control any audit or proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Canadian Company, and the Buyer Parties shall have no right to participate in any such proceeding. 8.5 Time of Payment. Payment by the Sellers or Buyers of any amounts due under this Article 8 in respect of Taxes shall be made (i) at least three (3) Business Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax Return, and (ii) within three (3) Business Days following an agreement between the Sellers and the Buyers that an indemnity amount is payable pursuant to an assessment of a Tax by a taxing authority or for any other reason, and (iii) within seven (7) Business Days following a "determination" as defined in section 1313(a) of the Code. -61-
8.6 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Sellers and the Buyers will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or furnishing information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase any of the Companies or any assets of the Companies from the Buyers. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Sellers, Buyers and the Companies shall make their employees available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Each of the Sellers and the Buyers shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Companies (collectively, "Tax Documents") for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods in accordance with all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, but in any event until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Each party agrees to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such Tax Documents and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of such Tax Documents. Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Any information obtained under this Section 8.6 shall be kept confidential in accordance with Section 7.2 except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. 8.7 Conveyance Taxes. The Sellers shall be liable for and shall hold the Buyers harmless against any sales, use, transfer (including, without limitation, real property transfer or gains), value added, stock transfer, and stamp taxes, recording, registration, and other fees, and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the sale of the Interests, and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure. The US Buyer shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Sellers to comply with the foregoing. 8.8 Accounts Receivable Election. Upon finalization of the Closing Balance Sheets, the Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall, pursuant to Section 22 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), jointly elect to have the provisions of Section 22 apply to the purchase and sale of those receivables that are part of the Canadian Assets by completing form T2022. This form will be filed by the Canadian Buyer pursuant to Section 22 of the Income Tax Act (Canada). -62-
8.9 Canadian Sales and Transfer Taxes. Each party shall pay direct to the appropriate Governmental Entity all sales and transfer taxes, registration charges and transfer fees, other than the goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax imposed under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada), payable by it in respect of the purchase and sale of the Canadian Assets under this Agreement. 8.10 Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax Election. The Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall jointly elect, under subsection 167(1) of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada), and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation imposing a similar value added or multi-staged tax, that no tax be payable with respect to the purchase and sale of the Canadian Assets under this Agreement. The Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall make such election(s) in prescribed form containing prescribed information and the Canadian Buyer shall file such election(s) in compliance with the requirements of the applicable legislation. 8.11 Self-Assessment of Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax on Real Property. To the extent permitted under subsection 221(2) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation, the Canadian Buyer shall self-assess and remit directly to the appropriate Governmental Entity any goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax imposed under the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any similar value added or multi-staged tax imposed by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation payable in connection with the transfer of any interest in real property. The Canadian Buyer shall make and file a return(s) in accordance with the requirements of subsection 228(4) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation. 8.12 Retail Sales Tax Certificate.

The obligation of the Seller Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) the representations and warranties of the Buyers contained in Article 5, when read in conjunction with the applicable schedules hereto, shall be true, complete and correct in all material respects (except to the extent any such representation or warranty contains qualifiers such as material, Material Adverse Effect, or Material Adverse Change in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects in accordance with its terms) on and as of the date of this Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect if made on the Closing Date (other than those that are made as of a specific date, which shall be true and correct in all material respects only as of such date); (b) the Buyers shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all of their covenants hereunder required to be performed and complied with by them prior to the Closing; (c) the Buyers shall have delivered to the Sellers certificates to the effect that each of the conditions specified in Section 9.2(a) and (b) above are satisfied in a form reasonably acceptable to Sellers; (d) there shall not be any action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened before any Governmental Entity or before any arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to result in an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge, which would (i) prevent consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (ii) cause any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be rescinded following consummation; (e) all applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall have expired or otherwise been terminated without objection of the relevant Governmental Entity; (f) the Buyers shall have executed and/or delivered to the Seller Parties the documents identified in Section 3.3; and (g) the Buyers shall have tendered delivery to the Seller Parties of the Closing Payment and US Stock Consideration at the Closing. The Seller Parties may waive any condition specified in this Section 9.2 in whole or in part, other than Section 9.2(e), if it executes a writing so stating at or prior to the Closing; provided, that no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of any rights to indemnification pursuant to Article 11 relating to the facts, circumstances, or conditions preventing such condition from being satisfied. -65-
ARTICLE 10 TERMINATION 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transaction contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: (a) By mutual written consent of the Buyers and the Sellers; (b) By the Buyers, or by the Sellers, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the later of March 31, 2003, and the fifth (5th) Business Day following termination or expiration of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the transaction to be consummated on or before such date); (c) By the Buyers, or by the Sellers, if any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and nonappealable; (d) By the Sellers, upon five (5) Business Days notice to the Buyers, if prior to the Closing Date (i) there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties on the part of the Buyers contained in this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Buyers to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) there shall have been a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyers contained in this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Buyers to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in either case (i) or (ii) which breach shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following notice thereof to the Buyers, or (iii) there shall have been a Bankruptcy Event with respect to either Buyer; (e) By the Buyers, upon five (5) Business Days notice to the Sellers, if prior to the Closing Date (i) there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties on the part of the Seller Parties contained in this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the Companies or materially adversely affects the ability of the Seller Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) there shall have been a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Seller Parties contained in this Agreement, in either case (i) or (ii) which breach shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following notice thereof to the Company or the Sellers, as applicable, or (iii) there shall have occurred any event or circumstance that has had or, but for the passage of time, would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies. -66-

(e) the Canadian Retained Liabilities; (f) any payments received by the US Company pursuant to the Great Plains Settlement prior to Closing that are required to be returned to Great Plains Software O.C., Inc., pursuant to the terms thereof and are returned to Great Plains Software O.C., Inc. after Closing; (g) any claims or liabilities incurred prior to, on, or after Closing by Non-Company Participants and/or by dependents or beneficiaries of Non-Company Participants to the extent such claims or liabilities relate to coverage under the terms of the Plans (other than the Company 401(k) Plan); (h) the participation of Non-Company Participants in the Company 401(k) Plan following the Closing and the Spin-Off, but not including any Damages arising out of negligent actions taken by Buyer or the Company (not at the direction of Sellers or their Affiliates) following the Closing; (i) any late contributions to the Kar Retirement Plan as disclosed on Schedule 4.14(d); and (j) all Environmental Claims related to the Owned Real Property, other than for those Environmental Claims arising out of or relating to any act or omission of the Buyer Parties. 11.3 Indemnification of the Seller Parties. Except as otherwise provided in Article 8 and Section 7.5, each of the Buyers agrees to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parties and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, agents, successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and all Damages which may be asserted against or sustained or incurred by the Seller Indemnitees in connection with, arising out of or related to or resulting from: (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyers under Article 5 of this Agreement as of the date hereof; (b) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyers under Article 5 of this Agreement as if such representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date (excluding each representation and warranty that by its terms is made as of a date specified therein); (c) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed on the part of any Buyer under this Agreement; -68-
(d) any Damages suffered or incurred by the Seller Parties by reason of or in connection with any claims or cause of action of any third party to the extent arising out of any action, inaction, event, condition, liability or obligation of the Buyer Parties in connection with their operation of the business of the Companies by the Buyer Parties after the Closing; and (e) the Canadian Assumed Liabilities. 11.4 Intentionally Omitted. 11.5 Procedures. Except as otherwise provided in Article 8, the following provisions shall apply to claims for Damages arising from claims by a third party (each a "Claim"). Promptly after receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification under this Article 11 of notice of the commencement of a Claim in respect of which such Person will seek indemnification hereunder, such Person shall notify in writing the Person(s) from whom indemnification hereunder is sought, which notice shall specify the nature of such Claim, the amount of Damages sought in such Claim, if known, and the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. Failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Article 11 except to the extent that the indemnifying party's ability to defend such Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. If the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder against any Damages that may result from a Claim, the indemnifying party shall have the absolute right, in its sole discretion and expense, to elect to defend, contest or otherwise protect against any such Claim with legal counsel of its own selection so long as the indemnifying party gives notice of its intention to so defend, contest or otherwise protect against such Claim within five days of its receipt of notice from the indemnified party regarding such Claim; provided that nothing herein shall entitle the indemnifying party to control the defense or settlement of any Claim to the extent the Claim if successful could materially interfere with the business, operations, assets, conditions or prospects of the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof through counsel of its own choice and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all cross-claims or counterclaims it may have. The indemnified party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees), to at all times cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make their relevant files and records available for inspection and copying by, or otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the indemnifying party in its defense of any action for which indemnity is sought under this Article 11. In the event the indemnifying party fails to timely defend, contest or otherwise protect against any Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest, assert cross-claims or counterclaims or otherwise protect against the same at the indemnifying party's expense. The indemnifying party may not, without the consent of the indemnified party settle or compromise any Claim if the settlement or compromise imposes equitable remedies or material obligations on the indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. 11.6 Limitations on Indemnification; Additional Indemnification Provisions. -69-
(a) The indemnifying party shall have no obligation to pay any claim for indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2(a) and (b) or 11.3(a) and (b) of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Threshold Indemnity Amount"). In the event the aggregate amount of all such claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2(a) and (b) or 11.3(a) and (b) for which an indemnified party seeks indemnification hereunder exceeds the Threshold Indemnity Amount, the indemnifying party or parties shall be liable for the entire indemnity amount with respect to such aggregated claims, including the Threshold Indemnity Amount, up to a maximum amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). The Threshold Indemnity Amount and the maximum amount of claim for indemnification set forth herein shall not apply to any claims in the case of fraud, an intentional misrepresentation or an intentional breach of any warranty. (b) The indemnification and equitable remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties and their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein is intended to waive or otherwise limit any claims for Damages resulting or arising from fraudulent or willful misconduct or to waive any equitable remedies to which a party may be entitled. (c) The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on any representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Schedules attached hereto will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any notice or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon and after Closing, (i) the US Company shall cease to be a Seller Party and shall cease to have any indemnification obligations as a Seller Party hereunder and shall be treated as a Buyer Party, and the Seller Parties shall have no rights of recourse, whether for contribution, by virtue of subrogation, section 2.2 of that certain Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of KAR Products, LLC, dated as of August 30, 2000, or otherwise, against the US Company for any payments such Seller Party make, or are obligated to make, under this Article 11 or any other section of this Agreement, and (ii) the Seller Parties and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged the D&O Indemnitees of and from any and all Damages which the Seller Parties and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, or any of them, has or ever had, or hereafter can, shall or may have, arising out of the actions or inactions of any such D&O Indemnitees in their capacities as officers or directors of the US Company; provided, however, that this Section -70-
11.6(d)(ii) shall not apply to Damages that arise from the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of any of the D&O Indemnitees. (e) Subject to Section 11.6(d), upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement, the indemnifying party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party against any third party in respect of the Damages to which the payment related. Without limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, each such indemnified party and indemnifying party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights. (f) The Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any matters to the extent of a Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.5 for such matter. (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party or its Affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement or the Schedules attached hereto (including, without limitation, any adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.5), or any document executed in connection with this Agreement or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event any Damages related to a claim by a party are covered by insurance, such party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance and such party shall not be entitled to recovery from any other party (and shall refund amounts received up to the amount of indemnification actually received) with respect to such Damages to the extent of such recovery under such insurance policy. (h) Each party agrees to use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages which form the basis of any claim for indemnification hereunder. (i) In the case any event shall have occurred which would otherwise entitle either party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, no Damages shall be deemed to have been sustained by such party to the extent of any actual Tax savings realized by such party with respect thereto (the "Tax Benefit"). Where an indemnified party has Tax losses, deductions, credits or other items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any Tax loses, deductions, credits or other items result from Damages shall be deemed realized only after the utilization of such Tax losses, deductions, credits or other items. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification from any other party under this Agreement. (j) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for all tax purposes, and no party shall take any position inconsistent with such characterization. ARTICLE 12 MISCELLANEOUS -71-
12.1. Press Releases and Announcements. No party will issue any press release or announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing Date without the prior approval of the other party; provided that any party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required in order to secure a Permit, consent or other third party approval, by Law or the rules of any national securities exchange or any automated inter-dealer quotation system on which the securities of either party (or any Affiliate thereof) are listed or admitted for trading (in which case the disclosing party will advise the other party at least one (1) Business Day prior to making such disclosure). 12.2. Expenses. The Sellers or the Parents, with respect to the Sellers, the Parents and the Companies, and the Buyers, with respect to the Buyers, will bear all legal, accounting, investment banking and other expenses incurred by the Sellers, the Parents and the Companies, or the Buyers, respectively, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such transactions are consummated. 12.3. Amendments; Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only by a written agreement executed and delivered by the Sellers and the Buyers (which amendments shall be binding on the Companies and the Parents). No other course of dealing between the parties to this Agreement or any delay in exercising any rights hereunder will operate as a waiver of any rights of such parties. 12.4. Successors and Assigns. No party hereto may assign or delegate any of such party's rights or obligations under or in connection with this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided that the Buyers may assign to an Affiliate or Affiliates thereof the obligation to purchase the Interests or the Canadian Assets, in which event the Buyers shall have joint and several liability with such Affiliates with respect to such obligation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto will be binding upon and enforceable against the respective successors and assigns of such party and will be enforceable by and will inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of such party. 12.5. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition of invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. 12.6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. 12.7.

Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party.

Any party may make service on the other parties by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the parties to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 12.8 above.

Notwithstanding any provision of Section 3 or Section 5, if the underwriter with respect to the offering, in its sole discretion, determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number or dollar amount of securities to be included in the underwritten offering or determines that some other limitation is advisable, the underwriter may exclude or otherwise limit the number of or dollar amount of securities to be included in the registration and underwriting; provided, that the Company shall include in the registration: (a) if the registration is for the account of the Company for the primary sale of its securities (including without limitation, the Follow-On Offering) or for the account of any Selling Holders as provided in Section 5 hereof: (i) first, the amount of securities proposed to be sold by the Selling Holders hereunder up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, which securities shall be allocated pro rata among the Selling Holders on the basis of the dollar amount of securities sought to be included therein by each Selling Holder, (ii) second, the amount of securities intended to be included by the Company and its Affiliates up to the maximum includable in the opinion of the underwriters, and (iii) third, the amount of securities proposed to be sold by any other securityholders up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, which securities shall be allocated pro rata among such securityholders on the basis of the dollar amount of securities sought to be included therein by each such Person; and (b) if the registration is for the account of any securityholder exercising "demand" registration rights other than the Holders under this Agreement: (i) first, all the securities of any securityholder exercising "demand" registration rights up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, (ii) second, the amount of securities proposed to be sold by the Selling Holders hereunder up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, which securities shall be allocated pro rata among the Selling Holders on the basis of the dollar amount of securities sought to be included therein by each Selling Holder, (iii) third, the amount of securities proposed to be sold by the Company and its Affiliates up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, and (iv) fourth, the amount of securities proposed to be sold by any other securityholders not exercising the demand up to the maximum amount includable in the opinion of the underwriters, which securities shall be allocated pro rata among such securityholders on the basis of the dollar amount of securities sought to be included therein by each such Person. If the number of shares of Registrable Securities which may be included by a Selling Holder is limited pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Company shall advise such Selling Holder of any exclusion or other limitation, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting or the method by which such number will be calculated. No shares of Registrable Securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such registration; provided, however, that such shares shall remain "Registrable Securities" hereunder and the Holders thereof shall be entitled to all rights set forth in this Agreement including, without limitation, the rights set forth in Section 5 hereof.

The Registrable Securities and/or other securities so withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such registration; provided, however, that if as a result of the withdrawal of such shares a greater number of shares of Common Stock or securities sought to be included by the Company, other Selling Holders or other securityholders may be included in such registration, then the Company, such other Selling Holders or such other securityholders shall have the right to include additional Common Stock or securities up to the maximum includable in the opinion of the underwriters (such additional Common Stock or securities so included to be allocated among the Company, such other Selling Holders and such other securityholders in the manner set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.1). 4.3 Notwithstanding the filing of any registration statement, the Company may, at any time prior to the effective date thereof and without liability to any Holder, determine not to register the securities to which the registration statement relates and withdraw such registration statement if such withdrawal is requested by the Person initiating the filing; provided, however, that any registration statement withdrawn pursuant to any request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities shall still fully satisfy the Company's obligation to effect a registration under Section 5. 4.4 In connection with the registration of the Holders' Registrable Securities on a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 5, neither the Company nor any other securityholder of the Company or any other Person shall have the right to participate in sales pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement.

Indemnification. 10.1 To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify each Selling Holder joining in a registration and its partners, members, directors and officers, as applicable, the underwriter and its officers, directors and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls any Selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and their respective successors (collectively, "Indemnitees") against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus, registration statement (including, without limitation, the Shelf Registration Statement), offering circular or other document incident to any registration, qualification or compliance (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, or any violation by the Company (or any of its officers or directors) of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse each such Indemnitee for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage or liability is caused by any untrue statement or omission so made in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Indemnitee(s) (or the Selling Holder(s) related to such Indemnitee(s)) or any failure of such Indemnitee (or the Selling
-13- Holder related to such Indemnitee) to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements as to which the Company or the underwriters have given the Selling Holders written notice or arising out of or based on a breach by such Indemnitee (or the Selling Holder related to such Indemnitee) of Section 8.4 hereof. The foregoing indemnity agreement is also subject to the condition that, insofar as it relates to any such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in an amended prospectus on file with the SEC at the time the registration statement (including, without limitation, the Shelf Registration Statement) becomes effective or in an amended prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) (the "Final Prospectus"), the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter, or any Indemnitee if there is no underwriter, if the Company furnished copies of the Final Prospectus to the Selling Holders (including the underwriter, if any) as required by the Securities Act and if such a copy of the Final Prospectus was not furnished by the Indemnitee (or the Selling Holder related to such Indemnitee) or underwriter (if any) to the Person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time furnishing the Final Prospectus is required by the Securities Act. 10.2 To the extent permitted by law, each Selling Holder joining in a registration, severally and not jointly, will indemnify the Company and its officers and directors, the underwriter and its officers, directors and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls any thereof within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and their respective successors against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus, registration statement (including, without limitation, any Shelf Registration Statement), offering circular or other document incident to any registration, qualification or compliance (or in any related registration statement (including, without limitation any Shelf Registration Statement), notification or the like) or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which they were made to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by such Selling Holder or its representatives to the Company for inclusion in any of such documents or arising of or based on any failure to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements or any breach by such Selling Holder of Section 8.4 hereof and will reimburse the Company and each other Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.2 for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action. Any Selling Holder's liability under this Section 10.2 shall be in proportion to and limited in all events to the net amount received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement (including, without limitation, the Shelf Registration Statement). 10.3 Each party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and, if the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party shall have the absolute right, in its sole discretion and expense, to elect to defend, contest or otherwise protect against any such claim with legal counsel of its own selection so long as the indemnifying party gives notice of its intention to so defend, contest or otherwise protect against such claim within
-14- five days of its receipt of notice from the indemnified party regarding such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any claim through counsel of its own choice and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all cross-claims or counterclaims it may have. The indemnified party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees), to at all times cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make their relevant files and records available for inspection and copying by, or otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the indemnifying party in its defense of any action for which indemnity is sought under this Section 10. In the event the indemnifying party fails to timely defend, contest or otherwise protect against any claim, the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest, assert cross-claims or counterclaims or otherwise protect against the same at the indemnifying party's expense. The indemnifying party may not, without the consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise any claim if the settlement or compromise imposes equitable remedies or material obligations on the indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. If (i) the indemnified party and indemnifying party agree in writing, (ii) the indemnified party reasonably determines, based upon advice of indemnified party's counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests, the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain separate counsel at the indemnifying party's expense, and provided, further, that the omission by any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section 10 except to the extent that the omission results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and such indemnifying party is materially prejudiced solely as a result of the failure to give notice. No indemnifying party (i) shall be liable for amounts paid in any settlement if such settlement is effected without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (ii) shall be liable for the fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and one local counsel) at any time for all indemnified parties. 10.5 If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to a party that would have been an indemnified party under this Section in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the extent permitted by law to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statement or omission which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10.5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10.5. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10.5 shall include any legal or other expenses
-15- reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in Section 10.4 if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In the event of any underwritten offering of Registrable Securities under the Securities Act subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Selling Holder agree, to the extent practicable, to enter into an underwriting agreement, in customary form, with the underwriters, which underwriting agreement may contain additional provisions with respect to indemnification and contribution. Section 11. Transfer of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may not be assigned by any Holder to a transferee or assignee of such securities without the prior written consent of the Company unless: (i) the transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of GC-Sun or a direct investor in GC-Sun or any of its Affiliates, (ii) such assignment would not cause the total number of Holders under this Agreement at such time to exceed ten (10), and (iii) such transferee or assignee enters into an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company to be bound by the terms of this Agreement including, without limitation, Section 12 hereof. Section 12. Lockup and Voting Agreements; Legend. 12.1 Lockup. Each Holder agrees, in connection with any registration by the Company of its securities for sale to the general public in an underwritten offering (whether or not the offering is pursuant to Section 5 hereof and whether or not such Holder is participating in such offering), that, upon request of the underwriters managing any such offering, such Holder will agree in writing not to sell, make short sales of or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Securities (other than that included in the registration) without the prior consent of such underwriters for such period of time as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters. The period of time that the lockup shall apply to the Holders shall not extend for more than ninety (90) days following the effective date of the applicable registration statement and shall commence on (a) if the Holders have or are offered the right to participate in such offering as provided or contemplated by Section 3 with the priority provided or contemplated by Section 4.1(a), the date on which the preliminary prospectus is first distributed in connection with such offering, provided, if the applicable registration statement is not declared effective within thirty (30) days after the commencement of such period, the lockup shall not apply from the end of such thirty (30) day period until the applicable registration statement is declared effective, or (b) otherwise, the date on which the applicable registration statement is declared effective. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1 to the contrary, the obligations under this Section 12.1 shall apply only to the extent that each executive officer and director of the Company holding Common Stock of the Company, holders of 5% or more of the Company's Common Stock who are Affiliates of the Company and other participants in such registration (collectively the "Lockup Persons") shall enter into similar lockup agreements that are no more favorable to such Lockup Persons than those applicable to the Holders and which have a duration the same as that applicable to the Holders. In the event that the Company or the managing underwriter(s) shall release any such
-16- Lockup Persons from the requirements of any such lockup agreement, each Selling Holder shall be entitled to a corresponding pro rata release from its lockup. 12.2 Voting Agreement. Each Holder hereby agrees that (a) at each annual and special meeting of the stockholders of the Company such Holder will vote such Registrable Securities (i) for the election to the Board of Directors of the Company of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors of the Company to be elected, (ii) in favor of any matter recommended to be approved by the stockholders of the Company by the Board of Directors of the Company and (iii) against any matter not recommended to be approved by the stockholders of the Company by the Board of Directors of the Company; (b) such Holder will not nominate or vote in favor of the election to the Board of Directors of any person who was not proposed by the Board of Directors to be so elected; (c) such Holder will consent in writing to any action which has been proposed by the Board of Directors to be approved by the stockholders of the Company by written consent; and (d) such Holder will not consent in writing to any action which has not been proposed by the Board of Directors to be approved by the stockholders of the Company by written consent. Each Holder agrees to cause any Affiliate of such Holder to whom it sells or otherwise transfers any of the Registrable Securities to comply with the provisions of this Section 12.2 whether or not such Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11. The Holder hereby irrevocably grants to Signe S. Gates, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, in her capacity as Secretary of the Company, together with any successors in the office of Secretary, and any designee of any of the foregoing, a proxy to vote the Registrable Securities in the manner required pursuant to this Section 12.2. The Holder agrees that the foregoing proxy is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest. This Section 12.2 shall apply to each Holder and its Affiliates until such Holder or its Affiliates no longer own or otherwise hold any Registrable Securities. 12.3 Certain Tender Offers. Each Holder agrees that such Holder will not tender or exchange any Registrable Securities in any tender offer or exchange offer which has not been approved or recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company or a special committee thereof (a "Tender Offer") unless (a) such Holder has given written notice to the Company of its intention to tender such Restricted Securities in such Tender Offer and offers in such written notice to sell such Restricted Securities to the Company as provided in this Section 12.3, and (b) the Company has not, within five (5) business days after receiving the written notice of such Holder, accepted such Holder's offer in writing. If the Company accepts the Holder's offer (i) the Company shall be obligated to purchase, and the Holder shall be obligated to sell, the Restricted Securities subject to clause (vi) below, (ii) the purchase price for the Registrable Securities shall be the amount of consideration the Holder would receive for the Registrable Securities if they were tendered in the Tender Offer assuming, if applicable, that the Holder elected to receive all cash consideration, (iii) the purchase price shall be paid in cash with any non-cash consideration in the Tender Offer being deemed to have a value attributed to such consideration in the Tender Offer or, if no such value is specified, such value as shall reasonably be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company or a special committee thereof, (iv) the purchase and sale of the Registrable Securities shall be consummated within three (3) business days after the date on which the obligation of the offeror in the Tender Offer to purchase the Registrable Securities would have become non-contingent if such Registrable
-17- Securities were tendered in the Tender Offer, (v) if, after the date specified in clause (iv) it becomes apparent that the Holder would have received additional consideration if the Registrable Securities were tendered in the Tender Offer, the Company shall pay the Holder the amount of such additional consideration (valued, if applicable, in accordance with clause (iii) above) within three (3) business days after the date such consideration would have been paid to the Holder if the Registrable Securities were tendered in the Tender Offer, and (vi) if the Tender Offer is abandoned prior to the date specified in clause (iv), the Company's obligation to purchase, and the Holder's obligation to sell, the Registrable Securities shall automatically expire. Each Holder agrees to cause any Affiliate of such Holder to whom it sells or otherwise transfers any of the Registrable Securities to comply with the provisions of this Section 12.3 whether or not such Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11. This Section 12.3 shall apply to each Holder and its Affiliates until such Holder and its Affiliates no longer own or otherwise hold any Registrable Securities. 12.4 Legend. Each Holder agrees that each certificate representing shares of Registrable Securities held by such Holder shall bear the following legend: "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND VOTING CONTAINED IN A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 6, 2003, AMONG THE ISSUER OF SUCH SECURITIES (THE "ISSUER") AND THE HOLDER OF SUCH SECURITIES. A COPY OF SUCH REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, WILL BE FURNISHED PROMPTLY WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE UPON WRITTEN REQUEST." The Company agrees to cause certificates representing any Registrable Securities that are sold, transferred or assigned to any Person(s) who (i) will not be a Holder under this Agreement, and (ii) is not an Affiliate of GC-Sun (collectively "Non-Holders") to be issued without the foregoing legend. In connection with the removal of the foregoing legend from stock certificates representing Holders' Registrable Securities sold, transferred or assigned to Non-Holders, the Company agrees to provide all customary documentation and opinions of counsel requested by the Company's transfer agent to remove such legend from any such certificate and further agrees to issue to each Holder assigning or transferring its Registrable Securities to Non-Holder(s) new stock certificates representing the number of Registrable Securities still owned by such Holder after such sale, assignment or transfer. Section 13. Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of restricted securities to the public without registration, so long as any Holder owns any Registrable Securities, the Company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act ("Rule 144"); (b) use its best efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and
-18- (c) furnish to such Holder upon request, a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration. Section 14. Survival of Agreements. All agreements, representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by or on behalf of the Company and each Holder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The indemnification and contribution provisions of Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Section 15. Miscellaneous Provisions. 15.1 Amendments; Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only by a written agreement executed and delivered by the Company and Holders holding a majority of the outstanding Registrable Securities (which amendments shall be binding on the Company and all of the Holders). No other course of dealing between the parties to this Agreement or any delay in exercising any rights hereunder will operate as a waiver of any rights of such parties. 15.2 Successors and Assigns. Except as expressly permitted by Section 11, no party hereto may assign or delegate any of such party's rights or obligations under or in connection with this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto will be binding upon and enforceable against the respective successors and assigns of such party and will be enforceable by and will inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of such party. 15.3 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition of invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. 15.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. 15.5 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement. 15.6 Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given when delivered personally to the recipient or when sent to the recipient by telecopy or e-mail with confirmation of transmission by the transmitting equipment, one (1) Business Day after the date when sent to the recipient by reputable express courier service

The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party. The use of the word "including" in this Agreement means "including without limitation" and is intended by the parties to be by way of example rather than limitation. 15.9 Governing Law.

McKelvey Corporate Communications (860) 973-2132 BARNES GROUP FIRST QUARTER SALES SET NEW RECORD o Operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted E.P.S. all improve. o Kar Products integration proceeding on schedule. BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT, APRIL 17, 2003---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Net sales for the first quarter of 2003 were a record $218.7 million, up 13 percent from $194.2 million in the first quarter of 2002. The Company reported a 14 percent increase in operating income to $13.2 million, as net income increased to $7.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003, from $6.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. "We achieved a good quarter, as net sales, operating income and net income all grew nicely. We've laid a stable foundation for our three businesses for the rest of 2003, even as our end markets were somewhat impacted by a number of external challenges," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O. Sales at Barnes Distribution were $93.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, up 29 percent from $72.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2002. Of this $20.9 million increase, $19.2 million was contributed by Kar Products, which was purchased by Barnes Group on February 6, 2003. Barnes Distribution generated operating income of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, up 68 percent from operating income of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2002. The improvement in operating results was driven primarily by higher profitability in Barnes Distribution's North American operations, which included a higher gross profit margin, and incremental operating profit contributed by Kar Products. "We continue to enjoy success with the new growth programs we put into place in 2002," Carpenter stated. "Two of these programs, our increased focus on new national and regional customer development and our e-commerce platforms, contributed roughly $2.4 million in sales to the most recent quarter. We added 34 new national and regional customers this quarter, bringing to 150 the total new customers gained since the beginning of 2002," Carpenter added. -1-
Carpenter continued, "The integration of Kar Products is running at or slightly ahead of our original schedule. Customer and salesperson retention has been extremely strong, and the first elements of the infrastructure consolidation took place at the end of the first quarter. Clearly, the successful integration of Kar will remain a primary focus for the team at Barnes Distribution for the balance of the year." Sales at Associated Spring were $85.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, up 13 percent from $75.6 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2002. Top line growth in the 2003 period reflected approximately $10.1 million of incremental sales from recent acquisitions and continued growth in the sales of nitrogen gas spring products. Partially offsetting these items were a drop in sales related to a planned withdrawal from the heavy truck brake spring market, as well as a decline in organic sales to the telecommunications and electronics markets. Associated Spring's operating profit was $7.6 million for the first quarter of 2003, up from an operating profit of $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2002. Operating profit growth reflected a higher sales volume and the benefits of consolidation of the Dallas facility, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs, primarily pension and other postretirement expenses. Carpenter commented, "We indicated, at the time we announced the Dallas plant closure, that our actions would provide us with long-term expense reduction benefits. These benefits started to manifest themselves in the most recent quarter, as Associated Spring grew operating profit even as it began to absorb a higher pension expense burden." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $42.3 million for the first quarter of 2003, down 11 percent from $47.4 million in the first quarter of 2002. Operating profit was $2.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, down slightly from $2.9 million in the comparable year-ago period, reflecting the lower sales volume. Operating income was positively impacted by reduced employment levels and other actions taken throughout Barnes Aerospace in 2002 aimed at positioning the business for a period of lower commercial aerospace volume. Barnes Aerospace recorded orders of $38.3 million during the first quarter of 2003; order backlog remained solid at $148.2 million at March 31, 2003, compared with $151.8 million at year-end 2002. Impacting first-quarter 2003 orders and backlog was an order cancellation of approximately $7.1 million related to a single OEM customer. Direct and indirect orders for the U.S. military were approximately 26% of the orders booked during the first quarter of 2003. "This was an encouraging quarter for Barnes Aerospace, as we largely maintained our profitability as volume fell. Backlog declined only slightly during the period in a very challenging commercial aerospace environment, a continuing testament to the fact that the investments we have made over the past few years in sales, marketing and engineering within Barnes Aerospace are continuing to create new opportunities," Carpenter stated. William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "As one can see from the balance sheet and the analysis of change in net debt, net debt increased by $59.4 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net debt before acquisitions, however, was reduced by $1.8 million. This was accomplished through good control of working capital and capital expenditures. This compares to an increase in net debt before acquisitions of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2002." -2-

The 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Company and the 823,506 shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Selling Stockholder are collectively called the "Firm Common Shares". In addition, the Company has granted to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 423,525 shares (the "Optional Common Shares") of Common Stock, as provided in Section 2. The Firm Common Shares and, if and to the extent such option is exercised, the Optional Common Shares are collectively called the "Common Shares". Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS"), McDonald Investments Inc., Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated and BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc., have agreed to act as representatives of the several Underwriters (in such capacity, the "Representatives") in connection with the offering and sale of the Common Shares.

The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-104242) for the registration of Common Stock (including the Common Shares), preferred stock, debt securities and warrants of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act. Such registration statement has been declared effective by the
 
 
Commission. Such registration statement, as so amended, if applicable, including the exhibits and schedules thereto, and including all documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, prior to the execution of this Agreement, is called the "Registration Statement". The final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Common Shares, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Common Shares, including all documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, prior to the execution of this Agreement, is called the "Prospectus". A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus that omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and was used prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
 
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained", "included" or "stated" (all other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of this Agreement; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of this Agreement.

"ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to the Company or a subsidiary, any member of any group of organizations described in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (the "Code") of which the Company or such subsidiary is a member.

No "employee benefit plan" established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, if such "employee benefit plan" were terminated, would have any "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" (as defined under ERISA) except where such unfunded benefit liabilities would not result in a Material Adverse Change. Neither the Company, its subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any liability under (i) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any "employee benefit plan" or (ii) Sections 412, 4971, 4975 or 4980B of the Code, in each case except where such liabilities would not result in a Material Adverse Change. Each "employee benefit plan" established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and to the Company's knowledge, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification.

No Outstanding Loans or Other Indebtedness.
 
(ee) The Company has not been advised, and has no reason to believe, that it and each of its subsidiaries are not conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it is conducting business, except where failure to be so in compliance would not result in a Material Adverse Change.

S 9. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Common Shares as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

Contribution.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(d), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8(d) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(d) for purposes of indemnification.
provided, however
 
The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or
 
by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Common Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, the Selling Stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of the Common Shares sold by the Selling Stockholder, less the underwriting discount, as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus.

Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or the Selling Stockholder to any Underwriter, except to the extent that the Company is obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof, (b) any Underwriter to the Company or the Selling Stockholder, that if the Company reimbursed the Underwriters for their expenses pursuant to Section 6 hereof and the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters are obligated to reimburse the Company for all reimbursements made by the Company to the Representatives and the other Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 hereof, such obligation to reimburse the Company shall survive, or (c) of any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.

(v) The Common Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company have been duly authorized for issuance and sale pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth therein, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(vi) The Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission under the Securities Act. To the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending by the Commission.

(vii) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus including any document incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Prospectus including any document incorporated by reference therein (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included or incorporated by reference therein or in exhibits to or excluded from the Registration Statement, as to which no opinion need be rendered), as of the issue date thereof in the case of the Prospectus or any supplement
 
 
thereto or the filing date thereof in the case of the Registration Statement or any document incorporated by reference therein or in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
 
(viii) The Common Shares have been approved for listing upon notice of issuance on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
(ix) The statements (a) in the prospectus supplement under the caption "Description of Our Capital Stock" and (b) in Item 15 of the Registration Statement, insofar as such statements constitute matters of law, summaries of legal matters, the Company's charter or by-law provisions, documents or legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, have been reviewed by such counsel and fairly present and summarize, in all material respects, the matters referred to therein.
 
(x) No consent, approval, authorization or other order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental authority or agency, is required for the Company's execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and by the Prospectus, except as required under the Securities Act, applicable state securities or blue sky laws, or the rules of the NASD.
 
(xi) The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder (other than performance by the Company of its obligations under the indemnification section of the Underwriting Agreement, as to which no opinion need be rendered) (a) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company; (b) will not result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company; (c) will not constitute a breach of, or Default or a Debt Repayment Triggering Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, (A) the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 14, 2002, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of February 5, 2003, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, Fleet National Bank, as administrative agent, and HSBC Bank USA, KeyBank National Association, Mellon Bank, N.A. and Webster Bank, as co-documentation agents, or (B) any document filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or a filing specifically listed as being incorporated into the Prospectus; or (d) to the knowledge of such counsel, will not result in any violation of any law, administrative regulation or administrative or court decree applicable to the Company.

In addition, such counsel shall state that they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public or certified public accountants for the Company and with representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters
 
 
were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (other than as specified in paragraph (ix) above), and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to their attention which would lead them to believe that either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective or as the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date, at the date of any such amendment or supplement or at the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief as to the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto, or any other financial or accounting information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto).
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the federal law of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion (which shall be dated the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Underwriters, shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them and shall be furnished to the Representative) of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; , that such counsel shall further state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion of other counsel, and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on the representations and warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials.
provided, however
 
 
 
EXHIBIT B

(ii) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except for such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change.
 
(iii) To the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company, except for nominee shares or similar interests, is beneficially owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or, to the knowledge of such counsel, any pending or threatened claim.

(v) To the knowledge of such counsel, no stockholder of the Company or any other person has any preemptive right, right of first refusal or other similar right to subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company arising by contract or agreement.

Re:
Barnes Group Inc.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to GC-SUN Holdings II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Selling Stockholder"), in connection with the sale to you and the several underwriters for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Underwriters") on the date hereof by the Selling Stockholder of 823,506 shares (the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Barnes Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 2, 2003 (File No. 333-104242) but excluding the reports and proxy and registration statements filed by the Company with the Commission and incorporated in the Prospectus by reference (the "Incorporated Documents") (the "Registration Statement"), a Prospectus dated May 6, 2003 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act but excluding the Incorporated Documents (the "Prospectus") and an underwriting agreement dated May , 2003 among you, the Selling Stockholder and the Company (the "Underwriting Agreement"). This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(h) of the Underwriting Agreement.
    
 
As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter, except where a statement is qualified as to knowledge or awareness (in which case we have with your consent made no or limited inquiry as specified below). We have examined, among other things, the following:
 
(a) The Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus;
 
 
(b) The agreements identified on Exhibit A (the "Material Agreements");
 
(c) A Certificate of Limited Partnership of GC-SUN Holdings II, L.P., as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 22, 2000;
 
(d) The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of GC-SUN Holdings II, L.P., dated as of March 2000 (the "Partnership Agreement") and certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of GC-SUN G.P. II, Inc., in its capacity as general partner of the Selling Stockholder;
 
(e) The Certificate of Incorporation, dated February 22, 2000, and Bylaws of GC-SUN G.P. II, Inc.;
 
(f) A Certificate of Good Standing for GC-SUN Holdings II, L.P., dated as of May , 2003, obtained from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; and
    
 
(g) A certificate of an officer of the Selling Stockholder as to the absence of any court or administrative orders, writs, judgments or decrees specifically directed to the Selling Stockholder (the "Court Orders").
 
Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 
As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied upon oral and written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company and the Selling Stockholder in the Underwriting Agreement. We have not independently verified such factual matters.
 
Whenever a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that those attorneys in the firm who have rendered legal services in connection with the transaction referenced above do not have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as otherwise expressly indicated, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of any such statement.
 
We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States, the internal laws of the State of New York and the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware RULPA"), and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or, in the case of Delaware, any other
 
laws, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Our opinions set forth in paragraph 2 below are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to underwritten public offerings of common equity securities.
 
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
 
1. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership action of the Selling Stockholder, and the Selling Stockholder has duly executed and delivered the Underwriting Agreement.
 
2. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and the sale of the Shares by the Selling Stockholder to you and the other Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement on the date hereof do not:
 
(i) violate the Partnership Agreement; or
 
(ii) result in the breach of or a default under any of the Material Agreements; or
 
(iii) to the best of our knowledge, violate any federal, Delaware RULPA or New York statute, rule or regulation or Court Order applicable to the Selling Stockholder; or
 
(iv) to the best of our knowledge, require any consents, approvals, or authorizations to be obtained by the Selling Stockholder, or any registrations, declarations or filings to be made by the Selling Stockholder (other than such authorizations, approvals or consents as may be necessary under state or foreign securities laws or the National Association of Securities Dealers, as to which we express no opinion), in each case, under any federal, Delaware RULPA or New York statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Selling Stockholder that have not been obtained or made.
 
3. Upon physical delivery of the certificates evidencing the Shares listed on Exhibit B hereto to the several Underwriters in the State of New York, with stock powers duly endorsed in blank by an effective endorsement and payment therefore in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the several Underwriters will become "protected purchasers" (as defined in Section 8-303(a) of the New York UCC) of the Shares, free of any "adverse claim" (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(1) of the New York UCC).
 
In rendering the opinions in clause (ii) of paragraph 2 above insofar as they require interpretation of the Material Agreements, with your consent, (i) we have assumed that courts of competent jurisdiction would enforce such agreements in accordance with their plain meaning but would apply the internal laws of the State of New York (except with respect to those Material Agreements which state that they are
 
governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (the "Illinois Agreements")) without giving effect to any choice of law principles contained therein or any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the internal laws of any other state, (ii) to the extent that any questions of legality or legal construction have arisen in connection with our review, other than with respect to the Illinois Agreements, as to which we have applied Illinois law, we have applied the laws of the State of New York in resolving such questions, (iii) we express no opinion with respect to the effect of any action or inaction by the Selling Stockholder under the Material Agreements that may result in a breach or default under any Material Agreement, and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to any matters which would require us to perform a mathematical calculation or make a financial or accounting determination. Because certain of the Material Agreements may be governed by other than New York or Illinois law, this opinion may not be relied upon as to whether a breach or default would occur under the law actually governing such Material Agreements. No opinion is expressed in clauses (iii) and (iv) of paragraph 2 as to the application of laws which by custom are understood to be excluded from such opinions, including Section 548 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and comparable provisions of state law, federal securities laws (certain aspects of which are expressly addressed elsewhere herein), state securities laws, antifraud laws, or antitrust or trade regulation laws, ERISA or similar laws.
 
In rendering the opinions of paragraph 3 above, with your consent we have assumed that each of the Underwriters does not have "notice" of any "adverse claim" (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the New York UCC) applicable to the Shares and that the conditions set forth in Section 3(b) of the Consent and Release Agreement have been satisfied.
 
Our opinion in paragraph 3 is limited to Article 8 of the New York UCC and such opinions do not address laws other than Article 8 of the New York UCC or what law governs whether an adverse claim can be asserted against the several Underwriters.
 
This letter is furnished only to you in your capacity as Representatives of the several Underwriters in their capacity as underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This letter may not be relied upon by you or them for any other purpose, or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity for any purpose (including any person, firm or other entity that acquires Shares from you or the other Underwriters) without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in our sole discretion.
 
Very truly yours,

McKelvey Corporate Communications (860) 973-2132 BARNES GROUP SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME UP 12 PERCENT; SALES INCREASE 10 PERCENT TO RECORD $230 MILLION BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT, JULY 17, 2003---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Net sales for the second quarter of 2003 were a record $229.6 million, up 10 percent from $209.4 million in the second quarter of 2002. The Company reported a 16 percent increase in operating income to $16.0 million, as net income increased to $9.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003, from $8.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. "We continued to successfully execute on our business strategies this past quarter, generating the highest quarterly sales in our Company's history while achieving higher profitability than a year ago. We attained these results despite the dampening effects of the war in Iraq, SARS and the weak industrial economy in many of our end markets," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O. Sales at Barnes Distribution were $104.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, up 41 percent from $74.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2002. Kar Products, which Barnes Group purchased on February 6, 2003, contributed $31.0 million of sales in the most recent quarter. Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, up 42 percent from operating profit of $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2002. The improvement in operating profit was driven primarily by incremental operating profit contributed by Kar Products. "Excluding Kar, sales at Barnes Distribution were essentially flat versus a year ago. While the industrial economy remains a hurdle to sales expansion, several of our growth initiatives continued to accelerate," Carpenter stated. "Our increased focus on new national and regional customer development and our e-commerce platforms together contributed $3.4 million in sales to the most recent quarter. More than 40 new national and regional customers were added this quarter, bringing to 191 the total new customers gained since January, 2002. And, new Tier 2 relationships we've launched with four strategic partners in the MRO marketplace are showing some very promising early results," Carpenter added. -1-
Carpenter continued, "The integration of Kar Products continues to go well, as a number of critical functions were consolidated this past quarter. During the third quarter, a key integration of the order entry system is scheduled to take place, paving the way to the initial phase of the distribution center consolidation. Thus, we believe our original estimate of having a fully-integrated operation within the first 12 months of our ownership is right on schedule." Sales at Associated Spring were $86.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, down two percent from $88.0 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2002. The decline reflected lower sales into the light vehicle, telecommunications and electronics markets, as well as a planned drop in sales related to heavy trucks. Partially offsetting this were higher sales of nitrogen gas springs and products used in industrial markets. Associated Spring's operating profit was $9.1 million for the second quarter of 2003, up from $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating profit growth reflected the benefits from the 2002 closure of Associated Spring's Dallas facility and the absence of $0.8 million of purchase price accounting adjustments related to Seeger-Orbis that were incurred in the year-ago period. Partially offsetting this was the lower profit contribution on the lower sales volume. Carpenter commented, "Our sales of products destined for light vehicles were down only four percent this quarter, even as light vehicle production in North America fell by nearly nine percent. By positioning Associated Spring over the past several years to be less dependent on a handful of customers, we have been able to partially mitigate our exposure to this most recent turn in the industry's cycle. Through steps taken in early 2002, Associated Spring has also improved its current profitability, even on lower sales volume." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $40.6 million for the second quarter of 2003, down from $49.4 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating profit was $2.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, down from $3.0 million in the comparable year-ago period, reflecting the lower sales volume. The sales volume impact on operating profit was partially offset by the benefits from reduced employment levels and other productivity actions taken throughout Barnes Aerospace in 2002. Barnes Aerospace recorded orders of $29.0 million during the second quarter of 2003; order backlog was $136.2 million at June 30, 2003, compared with $151.8 million at year-end 2002. Impacting orders in the second quarter of 2003 were commercial OEM delivery deferrals and lower repair and overhaul volume stemming from SARS and the Iraqi conflict; a military order deferral triggered by a delay in program funding; and a modest reduction in orders due to a cancellation of a particular component. Direct and indirect orders for the U.S. military were approximately 30 percent of the net orders booked during the second quarter of 2003. "Operating profit margin at Barnes Aerospace increased even as sales declined, confirming the success of the actions taken last year to properly position the business. Orders in the second quarter were clearly impacted by the strain on the commercial aerospace sector caused by SARS and the war. Orders were further affected by our decision not to manufacture a particular component, as the pricing was inconsistent with generating sustainable, profitable growth," Carpenter stated. -2-
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "We completed a successful common stock offering this past quarter, raising $42 million in net proceeds that were used to pay down our existing debt, significantly strengthening our balance sheet. Through the offering, we have also greatly increased the trading volume in our stock, providing a higher degree of liquidity for our investors." For the first six months of 2003, Barnes Group's net sales were $448.3 million, up 11 percent from $403.6 million in the same period a year ago. Net income was $17.1 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2003, up 11 percent from $15.4 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the same period of 2002. Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss second quarter 2003 results on Thursday, July 17, 2003 at 10:30 AM ET. A webcast of the live call, supporting materials and an archived replay will be available on the Barnes Group investor relations website ir.barnesgroupinc.com). Barnes Group Inc.

McKelvey (860) 973-2132 BARNES GROUP ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS - NET SALES INCREASE 13 PERCENT TO $222 MILLION - OPERATING INCOME UP 40 PERCENT, NET INCOME INCREASES 29 PERCENT TO $9 MILLION - AEROSPACE ORDERS EXCEED $51 MILLION, DRIVING ORDER BACKLOG TO $149 MILLION BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT, OCTOBER 16, 2003---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Net sales for the third quarter of 2003 were $222.2 million, up 13 percent from $196.8 million in the third quarter of 2002. The Company reported a 40 percent increase in operating income to $14.0 million, as net income increased to $9.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003, from $6.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. Average diluted shares outstanding were 23.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2003, up 21 percent from 19.2 million in the year-ago period. "Our operating performance this quarter, despite the headwind of a still-sluggish economic climate, clearly demonstrates the returns from investments we continue to make to generate sustainable, profitable growth for our Company," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O. "Going forward, these investments should continue to enhance our top- and bottom-line performance," Carpenter continued. Sales at Barnes Distribution were $103.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, up $31.8 million, or 44 percent, from $72.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Kar Products, which Barnes Group purchased in February 2003, contributed $30.8 million of sales in the most recent quarter. Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2003, up sharply from operating profit of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. The improvement in operating profit was driven primarily by the operating profit contribution from Kar Products and higher gross profit margin. Included in Barnes Distribution's operating profit is an incremental year-over-year gain of $0.9 million from the sale of distribution centers; the gain was essentially offset by approximately $0.8 million of incremental severance expense. -1-
"This was a solid quarter for Barnes Distribution; beyond tripling operating profit, the integration of Kar is running ahead of our original schedule, and our new sales growth initiatives are performing very well," Carpenter stated. "Our national and regional customer development efforts, e- commerce platforms and new Tier 2 relationships together contributed $5.9 million in sales to the most recent quarter, up from $1.8 million last year. We added more than 50 new national and regional customers, bringing to 249 the total new customers gained since January, 2002," Carpenter added. Carpenter continued, "During the quarter, we continued to integrate Kar Products into Barnes Distribution, achieving a number of milestones. As a result of the progress we have made to date, we believe that Kar will be substantially integrated in the United States by the end of the year, and the integration in Canada, which includes the construction of a new distribution center, will be completed in the first half of 2004." Sales at Associated Spring were $81.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, up slightly compared with sales of $80.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. The increase reflected higher sales of nitrogen gas springs and products for industrial markets, combined with the positive impact on sales from foreign currency translation. These were essentially offset by a decline in sales related to the North American light vehicle market. Associated Spring's operating profit was $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2003, down from $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2002. Operating profit was positively impacted by the benefits from the 2002 closure of Associated Spring's Dallas, Texas facility. This was more than offset by certain incrementally higher personnel costs, including pension and severance expenses totaling approximately $1.0 million, and a $0.5 million reduction in the carrying value of the Dallas facility, which is currently held for sale. Carpenter commented, "Associated Spring continues to successfully leverage higher-growth segments of its key markets, such as nitrogen gas springs and the non-U.S. automakers, to offset sales declines with some domestic customers. Although this business remains quite profitable, during the third quarter we began taking additional actions aimed at improving operating margins to be more in line with historical levels." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $39.4 million for the third quarter of 2003, down from $45.8 million in the third quarter of 2002. Operating profit was $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, up from $1.4 million in the comparable year-ago period, reflecting the benefit of cost reduction efforts taken during 2002, productivity and efficiency improvements and the absence of $0.7 million in severance that occurred in the 2002 period. These positives were offset in part by the sales volume decline. Barnes Aerospace recorded orders of $51.7 million during the third quarter of 2003, up 32 percent from $39.1 million in the comparable year-ago period. Backlog increased to $149.3 million, up four percent from $143.0 million at September 30, 2002. Military orders were $18.1 million, or 35 percent of the orders received in the most recent quarter; this included direct military orders that were particularly strong at $9.8 million. Barnes Aerospace also received approximately $10.3 million in orders related to a large commercial engine program that will enter service in early 2004. -2-
"It would appear that we have turned the corner at Barnes Aerospace from a very challenging post-9/11 environment," Carpenter stated. "As a result of the efforts taken to position the business for this difficult part of the aerospace cycle, we are continuing to report solid operating results. With the strong orders generated this past quarter, Barnes Aerospace is very well positioned for top- and bottom-line growth in 2004," Carpenter added. William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "In addition to a strong operating performance in the third quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing borrowings at September 30, 2003 by approximately $9 million compared to June 30, while at the same time increasing cash by $12 million, to $63 million. Our debt-to- capitalization ratio at quarter-end was 45 percent, which is within our targeted leverage range." For the first nine months of 2003, Barnes Group's net sales were $670.5 million, up 12 percent from $600.4 million in the same period a year ago. Net income was $26.1 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, up 17 percent from $22.3 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in the same period of 2002. Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss third quarter 2003 results on Thursday, October 16, 2003 at 12:00 PM ET. A webcast of the live call, supporting materials and an archived replay will be available on the Barnes Group investor relations website (ir.barnesgroupinc.com). Barnes Group Inc.

Penn (860) 973-2126 Media: Stephen J. McKelvey (860) 973-2132 BARNES GROUP ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS - Full-year net sales climb 14 percent to record $891 million - 2003 net income up 22 percent to $33.0 million, diluted E.P.S. reaches $1.49 - Barnes Aerospace executes second Revenue Sharing Program BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT, FEBRUARY 13, 2004---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $220.3 million, up 20 percent from $183.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income increased 45 percent to $7.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003, from $4.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. Average diluted shares outstanding were 23.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2003, up 23 percent from 19.3 million in the year-ago period, primarily as a result of the follow-on equity offering completed in May, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, favorable tax items reduced income taxes by approximately $2.1 million. These items were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses, as well as the write-off of approximately $0.5 million after-tax of due diligence expenses related to an abandoned acquisition. For all of 2003, Barnes Group's net income was $33.0 million, an increase of 22 percent from $27.2 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.49 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1.42 in 2002. Net sales for 2003 were a record $890.8 million, up 14 percent from net sales of $784.0 million last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 22.1 million for the full year 2003, up 15 percent from 19.2 million in 2002. "Our reported financial results were above our plan, while we achieved a number of positive operational items in the fourth quarter. These included significant progress integrating Kar Products into Barnes Distribution and the execution of our second Revenue Sharing Program, or RSP, at Barnes Aerospace," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O. "Both of these items should have a continuing positive impact on our financial results," Carpenter added. -1-
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $98.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, up $30.8 million, or 46 percent, from $67.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2002. Kar Products, which Barnes Group purchased in February, 2003, contributed $27.3 million of sales in the most recent quarter. Excluding a $2.3 million positive impact of foreign currency translation in the 2003 period, organic sales grew slightly. Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The improvement in operating profit was driven primarily by the operating profit contribution and synergistic savings from Kar Products, as well as reduced selling expenses as a percentage of sales. This was partially offset by expenses directly associated with the Kar integration of approximately $1.3 million, as well as an impact on sales caused by a reduced order fill rate during the integration of distribution centers. "During the fourth quarter, we accelerated the consolidation of Kar Products into a new Barnes Distribution network, and as of today have essentially completed our original consolidation plan in the U.S., leaving most of the integration effort behind us," Carpenter stated. "Sales from our other key sales initiatives, including national and regional customer development efforts, e-commerce platforms and Tier 2 relationships, more than doubled from a year ago, to approximately $6 million," Carpenter added. For all of 2003, sales at Barnes Distribution were $400.7 million, up from $286.7 million in 2002; Kar Products contributed $108.3 million to the 2003 sales total. Operating profit was $16.5 million for 2003, up from $7.5 million in 2002. Sales at Associated Spring were $80.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, up from $77.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2002. Foreign currency translation positively impacted sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 by approximately $2.8 million. The slight increase in sales, net of the foreign currency translation effect, reflected higher sales of products for industrial applications and heavy trucks, and increased nitrogen gas spring volume, offset by a decline in sales of products for the telecommunications and electronics industries. Associated Spring's operating profit was $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, down from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Operating profit was negatively impacted by incrementally higher personnel costs, including medical, pension and other post-retirement expenses of approximately $1.6 million. Operating profit also fell as a result of less favorable product mix. Carpenter commented, "Associated Spring continued to outperform many of its key end-user markets during the fourth quarter; notably, sales of products for light vehicles were up slightly during the period, when production was essentially flat. With the outlook for many of its markets stable or improving, Associated Spring should have another solid year in 2004." For all of 2003, sales at Associated Spring were $333.1 million, up from $321.7 million in 2002; the 2003 sales total was positively impacted by approximately $18.7 million of incremental revenue from 2002 acquisitions and foreign currency translation. Operating profit was $26.8 million for 2003, compared with $28.1 million in 2002. -2-
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $43.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up from $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Operating profit was $3.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, essentially flat versus the comparable year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by higher OEM sales and the initial profit contribution from the first RSP, offset by a drop in historically higher-margin repair and overhaul sales. Barnes Aerospace recorded orders of $43.0 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2003; for the full year 2003, orders totaled $161.9 million. Order backlog ended 2003 at $147.7 million, compared with $151.8 million at December 31, 2002. Military orders were approximately 27 percent of the orders received in the fourth quarter of 2003, and approximately 29 percent of all the orders placed during 2003. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, Barnes Aerospace also received approximately $5.5 million in orders related to a large commercial engine program that will enter service in early 2004. "The order rate at Barnes Aerospace accelerated nicely in the second half of the year, setting the stage for a strong improvement in financial results in 2004," Carpenter stated. "It's also significant that we executed our second RSP at Barnes Aerospace in the fourth quarter. With terms very similar to the RSP we completed in the third quarter, this new RSP is expected to have a meaningful impact on Barnes Aerospace's profitability beginning in 2004," Carpenter added. For all of 2003, Barnes Aerospace generated sales of $165.7 million, down from $183.0 million in 2002. Operating profit was $10.7 million for 2003, compared with $10.8 million in 2002. William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "We had a strong financial performance in 2003, which helped us generate over $60 million in cash from operations. We ended 2003 with nearly $50 million in cash on our balance sheet, while reducing our debt-to- capitalization ratio at year-end to less than 43 percent, comfortably within our targeted leverage range. Thus, we are well positioned to support further growth investments in our businesses in 2004." Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss fourth quarter 2003 results on Friday, February 13, 2004 at 10:00 AM ET.

Penn (860) 973-2126 Media: Stephen J. McKelvey (860) 973-2132 BARNES GROUP ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS - Net sales climb 13 percent to record $247.2 million - Net income jumps 31 percent to $9.6 million, diluted E.P.S. rises to $0.40 - Strong orders at Barnes Aerospace, third RSP agreement completed Bristol, Connecticut, April 14, 2004---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Net sales for the first quarter of 2004 were a record $247.2 million, up 13 percent from $218.7 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net income increased 31 percent to $9.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2004, from $7.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the comparable year- ago period. Average diluted shares outstanding were 23.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2004, up 20 percent from 19.9 million in the year-ago period, primarily as a result of the follow-on equity offering completed in May, 2003. "With the financial results we generated in the first quarter, 2004 is off to a strong start, and the momentum improved as we progressed through the quarter," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O. "Profitability at Barnes Distribution came in a bit ahead of our previous indications, even as the distribution center integration continued to move along, while sales growth at both Barnes Aerospace and Associated Spring significantly exceeded that of their primary end markets," Carpenter added. Sales at Barnes Distribution were $106.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, up $12.7 million, or 14 percent, from $93.8 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Excluding $10.4 million of incremental sales from the February 6, 2003 acquisition of Kar Products and the positive effect of foreign currency translation, organic sales were essentially flat. Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with operating profit of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2003. The improvement in operating profit was driven primarily by the incremental contribution from Kar Products and synergistic savings recognized from the Kar integration. Partially offsetting these improvements were integration costs of approximately $1.2 million, primarily for temporary -1-
labor, overtime and additional freight, as well as a slight reduction in gross margin versus the 2003 period. "With the distribution center integration now behind us in the U.S., we are focused on driving our fill rates back to the pre-integration level. Although we made significant progress in that regard during the first quarter, more work remains to be done. In our Canadian operations, we remain on schedule for the opening of a new distribution center in the Ontario province during the month of May," Carpenter stated. "Our strategic growth initiatives continued to generate solid gains, as sales from newly-opened national accounts, e-commerce platforms and Tier 2 relationships with other industrial distributors climbed to $6.4 million in the first quarter, up from $3.6 million a year ago," Carpenter added. Sales at Associated Spring were $93.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, up 10 percent from $85.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Foreign currency translation positively impacted sales in the first quarter of 2004 by approximately $3.0 million. The increase in sales reflected growth in all market segments, particularly in heavy truck, where sales grew 24 percent and nitrogen gas products, where sales, net of foreign currency translation effect, grew approximately 13 percent. Associated Spring's operating profit was $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2004, down from $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. Operating profit was negatively impacted in the 2004 period by increased spending on lean initiatives, overtime and other measures to address capacity issues in two North American plants, a slight reduction in gross margin, and higher medical and pension expenses. These negatives were partially offset by the profit contribution from the increased organic sales volume. Carpenter commented, "This marked the first quarter in recent memory that we can report organic sales growth in all of Associated Spring's market segments. In addition to heavy truck and nitrogen gas springs, we also saw modest sales growth in products for light vehicles, even as North American production was flat. And for the first time since 2000, we saw growth in our telecomm and electronics product segment, which we are hopeful is indicative of a potential turn in those sectors." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $49.5 million for the first quarter of 2004, up from $42.3 million in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting solid growth in OEM sales and approximately $1.6 million in sales from the Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs). Operating profit was $4.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, up from $2.7 million in the comparable year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by higher OEM volume and profit contribution from the two RSPs completed in late 2003, which was partially offset by the operating profit impact of a modest drop in historically higher-margin repair and overhaul sales. Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $55.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the highest order level since the second quarter of 2001. Order backlog was $153.1 million at March 31, 2004, up solidly from $147.7 million at December 31, 2003. Military orders were approximately 27 percent of the orders received in the first quarter of 2004, and Barnes Aerospace also received approximately $9.2 million in orders related to a large commercial engine program that is about to enter customer service. -2-
"The order rate at Barnes Aerospace is once again at a pre-9/11 pace, reflecting the hard work of everyone on the team," Carpenter stated. "I'm also pleased to announce that we executed a third RSP in March that, like the RSPs we completed in 2003, will have a positive impact on Barnes Aerospace's 2004, and future, financial results. To date, we have committed nearly $60 million in RSP investments, and remain actively engaged in developing additional strategic relationships with our partners," Carpenter added. William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "We ended the quarter with approximately $32 million in cash, even after a $15 million cash payment related to our RSP agreements, bringing the total RSP payments to date to $32.5 million. We were able to fund these payments with cash held outside the United States, and thus successfully reinvest a significant portion of our foreign cash into strategic growth investments with attractive financial returns."

EXHIBIT 99.1            
Barnes Group Inc.
Executive Office Bristol, CT 06010 Tel: (860) 583-7070
     - Net sales rise 10 percent to $252 million, setting a new quarterly record.      - Net income rises 16 percent to $11.3 million, highest ever for the second quarter.      - Barnes Aerospace sales rise 31%, fourth RSP agreement completed.
---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net sales for the second quarter of 2004 were a record $252.0 million, up 10 percent from $229.6 million in the second quarter of 2003. Net income increased 16 percent to $11.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004, from $9.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. Average diluted shares outstanding were 23.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2004, up 11 percent from 21.4 million in the year-ago period, primarily as a result of the follow-on equity offering completed in May, 2003.
          Bristol, Connecticut, July 15, 2004
Barnes Group has generated record sales in each of the last two quarters, as we are benefiting from both our internal growth strategies and from the ongoing recovery in industrial activity. Operating margin in all three of our businesses improved from the first quarter, and we remain focused on improving profitability going forward," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and C.E.O.
          
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $53.3 million for the second quarter of 2004, up 31 percent from $40.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, reflecting solid growth in both OEM and overhaul and repair sales, and approximately $2.0 million in sales from the Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs). Operating profit was $5.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, more than double the $2.6 million in the comparable year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by the sharply higher sales volume and the profit contribution from the RSPs.
          
Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $53.8 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2004, up 86 percent from orders of $29.0 million generated in the second quarter of 2003. Order backlog was $153.4 million at June 30, 2004, up 13 percent from $136.2 million at June 30, 2003. Military orders were approximately 22 percent of the orders received in the second quarter of 2004, and Barnes Aerospace also received approximately $8.2 million in orders related to a major engine program.
          
"The team at Aerospace continues to generate solid top- and bottom-line results, as we set new quarterly records for sales and operating profit, even while the underlying commercial aircraft market has not grown," Carpenter stated. "I'm also pleased to announce that we executed a fourth RSP at the end of June, further expanding our opportunities in the spare parts marketplace. To date, we have committed $77.5 million in capital to our RSP investments, and expect to continue to generate healthy financial returns from these investments as we move forward," Carpenter added.
          
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $107.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, up two percent from $104.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Sales from Barnes Distribution's strategic growth initiatives - newly-opened national accounts, e-commerce platforms and Tier 2 relationships with other industrial distributors - climbed to $8.5 million in the second quarter, up from $4.8 million a year ago.
          
Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2004, up from $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. The improvement in operating profit was driven primarily by $1.8 million in incremental cost synergies from the integration of Kar Products, and to a lesser degree by the profit contribution from the increased sales volume. Offsetting most of these improvements were approximately $0.9 million in additional expenses to address customer service issues, predominantly expedited freight and overtime. Also negatively impacting profitability was a slight decline in gross margin, as well as distribution center integration costs of approximately $0.4 million.
          
"We essentially completed the integration of Kar Products in May, within 15 months of the acquisition, creating an organization that is among the 20 largest industrial distributors in North America. With the integration behind them, the team at Barnes Distribution is redoubling their efforts to improve customer service and efficiency, and specifically to address vendor-related supply constraints for fasteners and other steel-related products. We are aggressively working with both current vendors and alternative suppliers to minimize the impact to our customers going forward," Carpenter stated.
          
Sales at Associated Spring were $94.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, up nine percent from $86.6 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The increase in sales reflected growth in all market segments, particularly in heavy truck and industrial products, where sales grew 27 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
          
Associated Spring's operating profit was $7.7 million for the second quarter of 2004, down from $9.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. Operating profit was negatively impacted in the 2004 period primarily by increased raw materials prices, higher active and retiree medical expenses, severance costs and spending to address capacity issues in certain North American manufacturing facilities. These negatives, which had an incremental impact of approximately $3 million versus the 2003 period, were partially offset by the profit contribution from the increased sales volume.
          
Carpenter commented, "This is the second consecutive quarter in which we've grown sales in all five of Associated Spring's key customer segments. We continue to work aggressively to increase profitability at Associated Spring, through lean initiatives, alternative raw materials suppliers and increasing our manufacturing capacity in low-cost environments. A significant challenge to our progress, however, is that steel prices have continued to rise from earlier in the year. At the same time, we have been unsuccessful in recovering raw material pricing adjustments from many of our customers, particularly in the transportation industry."
          
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "We ended the quarter with approximately $39 million in cash, and used $12.5 million in cash on July 7 to meet one of our RSP payment obligations. All of the $45 million in RSP payments to date have been funded with cash held outside the United States. Thus, we have reinvested foreign cash into strategic investments, with attractive
          
financial returns. During the second quarter, we also amended our revolving credit agreement, giving us additional borrowing capacity to finance future growth initiatives, at more favorable terms."
For the first six months of 2004, Barnes Group's net sales were $499.2 million, up 11 percent from $448.3 million in the same period a year ago. Net income was $20.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2004, up 22 percent from $17.1 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003.
          
Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss second quarter 2004 results on Thursday, July 15, 2004 at 12:00 PM ET.

     - Net sales for the third quarter rise 10 percent to a record $244 million      - Barnes Aerospace books record orders, backlog climbs to $175 million.
          ---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Net sales for the quarter were $243.9 million, up 9.8 percent from $222.2 million in the third quarter of 2003. Net income increased to $9.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $9.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the year-ago period.
Bristol, Connecticut, October 18, 2004
          "This was a record third quarter for sales. Barnes Aerospace continues to outperform, benefiting from quick action taken following the 2002 market downturn and from our recent Revenue Sharing Program (RSP) investments. We are making continued progress in addressing the raw material cost and capacity issues at Associated Spring and customer service levels at Barnes Distribution, and we remain focused on fully resolving these matters as we move forward," said Edmund M. Carpenter, Barnes Group Inc.'s President and CEO.
          Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $51.7 million for the third quarter of 2004, up 31 percent from $39.4 million in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting solid growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales, including $2.7 million in new sales from the RSPs. Operating profit increased to $5.4 million for the quarter, more than doubling the $2.0 million in the comparable year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by the profit contribution from the sharply higher sales volume and the impact of the RSPs.
          Barnes Aerospace generated record orders of $73.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2004, up 41 percent from orders of $51.7 million generated in the third quarter of 2003 and the highest quarterly orders recorded in Barnes Aerospace's history. Order backlog reached a record $174.9 million at September 30, 2004, up 17 percent from $149.3 million at September 30, 2003. Military orders comprised approximately 15 percent of the total orders received in the most recent quarter, and Barnes Aerospace also received $21.6 million in orders related to a major engine program.
          "The team at Aerospace has made outstanding progress on the recovery of their business in the post-9/11 environment, driving record results in every key financial measure," Carpenter stated. "On the strength of our RSP investments, and the potential for a recovery in the underlying aerospace OEM market beginning in 2005, we're optimistic about the growth potential for Barnes Aerospace over the medium term," Carpenter added.
          Sales at Barnes Distribution were $107.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, up three percent from $103.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Sales from Barnes Distribution's
 
strategic growth initiatives - newly-opened national accounts, e-commerce platforms and Tier 2 relationships with other industrial distributors - rose approximately 70 percent to $8.8 million in the most recent quarter.
          Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2004, down from $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2003. The year-ago period included a gain of $1.3 million on the sale of a distribution center and severance costs of approximately $0.9 million. Operating profit in 2004 reflects approximately $1.2 million of additional expenditures made on strategic growth investments and approximately $0.7 million of costs to further improve customer service levels, primarily freight and overtime costs. Operating profit in 2004 was positively impacted by realization of incremental synergistic cost savings and lower integration costs compared to the year-ago period.
           "Sales, particularly those within our strategic initiatives, improved solidly from a year ago. We've made good progress since June in improving our customer service level to reach our target range. Fastener availability remains challenging, however, so there is some additional work to be done," Carpenter stated.
          Sales at Associated Spring were $88.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, up 8.8 percent from $81.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The increase in sales was across most of Associated Spring's key market segments, particularly in industrial and heavy truck where sales in each grew approximately 30 percent. DE-STA-CO Manufacturing, which Barnes Group acquired on September 17, 2004, contributed approximately $1.3 million in sales to Associated Spring during the period. Sales of nitrogen gas springs were down slightly versus a year ago reflecting weaker tool and die market segments.
          Associated Spring's operating profit was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2004, down from $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2003. Operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $1.8 million related to increased raw material prices and unfavorable LIFO inventory adjustments. In addition, Associated Spring incurred $0.9 million of expenses to address operating issues and lean manufacturing initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the profit contribution from the higher sales volume.
          Carpenter commented, "We continue to enjoy growth in most of Associated Spring's key customer segments, continuing a trend that began in the first quarter of this year. The integration of DE-STA-CO into Associated Spring is off to a good start. While we have made progress with some of our customers regarding increased raw material costs, we have been unsuccessful in addressing these costs with the majority of our transportation customers. We are hopeful that discussions with our customers regarding 2005 raw material pricing and availability will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
          William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Our balance sheet remains very strong to support our growth in the near term. After spending $16.9 million this quarter to acquire DE-STA-CO Manufacturing, our debt to capital ratio is at 45%, remaining within our targeted range."
          For the first nine months of 2004, Barnes Group's net sales were $743.1 million, up 10.8 percent from $670.5 million in the same period a year ago. Net income was $30.1 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, up 15.6 percent from $26.1 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003.
          Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss third quarter 2004 results on Monday, October 18, 2004 at 11:30 AM ET.

      - Net sales for the quarter rise 14 percent to a record $251.6 million       - Net sales for the full year rise 12 percent to a record $994.7 million       - Barnes Aerospace achieves full year record operating profit, sales, orders, and backlog
--- Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. Net sales for the quarter were $251.6 million, up 14 percent from $220.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income was $3.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Included in the fourth quarter results were pre-tax charges of approximately $4.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for actions implemented to offset higher raw material costs going forward at Associated Spring and to enable the realization of benefits from the Kar Products integration and improved customer service levels at Barnes Distribution. These charges include $3.5 million related to severance costs, which are estimated to generate annual savings of approximately $5.5 million, and $1.0 million in inventory and facility charges. The charges were partially offset by a $0.7 million pre-tax benefit related principally to the reduction of lease obligations on idle facilities within Barnes Distribution. For all of 2004, net sales were $994.7 million, up 12 percent from $890.8 million last year. Barnes Group's net income was $33.4 million, a slight increase from $33.0 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $1.49 in 2003. Full-year results excluding the fourth quarter charges of $4.5 million would have been $1.52 per diluted share. "Full year sales of just under $1 billion established a new record for the Company, including sales of $252 million in the fourth quarter," said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive

Barnes Group Inc. / 2 Officer, Barnes Group Inc. "The record sales year was driven by organic growth in each of the Company's business segments." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $51.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, up 19 percent from $43.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting continued growth in both OEM sales and aftermarket sales. Sales of components for the GE90-115B engine were at the highest levels since the program began and our aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs continued to generate solid sales. Operating profit increased to $5.5 million for the quarter, from $3.4 million in the comparable year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by the profit contribution from the sharply higher sales volume and the increased percentage of aftermarket activity. Barnes Aerospace generated record orders of $71.5 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2004, up 66 percent from orders of $43.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Order backlog reached a record $193.8 million at December 31, 2004, up 31 percent from $147.7 million at December 31, 2003. Military orders in the fourth quarter were strong at $23.9 million, and were approximately 33 percent of the total orders received in the most recent quarter. For all of 2004, sales at Barnes Aerospace were $205.9 million, an increase of 24 percent from $165.7 million in 2003. Operating profit rose 94 percent to a record $20.7 million from $10.7 million compared to a year ago. "In 2004, Barnes Aerospace achieved record results in operating profits, sales, and orders, generated the highest backlog in its history, and remains optimistic for its continued growth in 2005," stated Carpenter. Sales at Barnes Distribution were $104.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, up 6 percent from $98.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Sales from Barnes Distribution's strategic growth initiatives - newly-opened national accounts, e-commerce platforms and Tier 2 relationships with other industrial distributors - rose over 50 percent to $8.1 million in the most recent quarter. Barnes Distribution had an operating loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $2.3 million of pre-tax charges related to severance costs of $1.3 million and inventory and facility charges of $1.0 million, compared to an operating profit of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The charges in 2004 were partially offset by a $0.7 million pre-tax benefit related principally to the reduction of lease obligations. For all of 2004, sales at Barnes Distribution were $424.8 million, up from $400.7 million in 2003. Operating profit was $13.8 million for 2004, down from $16.5 million in 2003. "For Barnes Distribution, 2004 was an important year as critical initiatives were undertaken and completed providing the necessary operational structure for future growth," stated Carpenter. "With Barnes Distribution's customer service levels back to our targeted range, and the integration efforts now complete, we are well positioned for improved performance in 2005." Sales at Associated Spring were $97.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, up 21 percent from $80.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Double digit sales growth occurred across all of Associated Spring's key markets. DE-STA-CO Manufacturing, which Barnes Group acquired on September 17, 2004, contributed approximately $7.2 million in sales to Associated Spring during the quarter. Light vehicle sales grew by 11 percent, as growth in sales to transplants continued to outpace our sales to the U.S. automakers. Industrial product sales were up
Barnes Group Inc. / 3 a solid 35 percent, and sales of nitrogen gas springs were up approximately 17 percent in the fourth quarter. Associated Spring's operating profit was $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, down from $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Included in the fourth quarter results is a $2.2 million pre-tax charge for severance costs. In addition, operating results were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million related to increased raw material prices. For all of 2004, sales at Associated Spring were $373.5 million, up from $333.1 million. Operating profit was $22.5 million, down from $26.8 million in 2003. "Within Associated Spring we continue to diversify our customer base providing enhanced flexibility and increased opportunities for margin improvement. Since 1999, we grew our other businesses which significantly reduced the level of concentration of the Big-3 U.S. automakers light vehicle sales in our total Company sales from 16 percent to less than 9 percent," Carpenter commented. William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Our cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong. We generated over $54 million in cash flow from operating activities during 2004 and ended the year with $36.3 million in cash on our balance sheet. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at year-end was 44%, within our targeted leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to support the projected growth in our businesses in 2005." "During 2004, we implemented critical and necessary actions to address certain business realities. Our successful execution of these efforts has positioned each of our business segments for continued success in 2005," Carpenter added. The Company's targeted earnings for the full year 2005, based on current market conditions, is in the range of $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted share. Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2004 results at 11:00 a.m. ET today.

The Company has presented certain financial measurements, excluding certain fourth quarter charges. The fourth quarter charges which aggregate $4,510 include severance costs of $2,184 at Associated Spring and $1,298 at Barnes Distribution and $1,028 of inventory and facility charges at Barnes Distribution. These charges relate to discrete actions taken in the fourth quarter.
These fourth quarter charges represent discrete actions taken by management, and management believes that providing results excluding the discrete charges, is useful to investors and reflects actions announced by the Company in December, 2004. Management does not intend results excluding the fourth quarter charges to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use.

      - Net sales rise 11 percent to a record $273.7 million       - Net income rises 33 percent to a record $12.8 million; diluted EPS of $0.54       - Full-year 2005 estimated net income per diluted share raised to $1.80 - $1.90
---Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Net sales for the first quarter 2005 were $273.7 million, up 11 percent from $247.2 million in the first quarter of 2004. Operating income grew 34 percent to $21.1 million for the first quarter from $15.7 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Net income increased 33 percent to $12.8 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $9.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the year-ago period. "Barnes Group had a balanced, strong first quarter with each of the business segments generating record sales, including organic growth in each segment. On this sales growth, Barnes Group generated solid improvement in both operating profit and net income," said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. "The earnings generated in the first quarter reflect an overall strong performance in all three business segments. The actions taken late in the fourth quarter by the Company to offset increased costs enhanced the favorable operating results, and we continue to focus on improving profitable growth going forward," continued Carpenter. Sales at Barnes Distribution were a record $113.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, up $7.1 million or 7 percent, from $106.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Sales from two of Barnes Distribution's strategic growth initiatives, Corporate Accounts and Tier II, were up 13 percent and 48 percent respectively, for the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004. Barnes Distribution generated operating profit of $5.9 million, up 47 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $4.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in operating profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume, higher pricing, and the beneficial effects of the Kar acquisition integration, along with higher customer service levels, partially offset by increased product costs.
Bristol, Connecticut, April 21, 2005
Barnes Group Inc. / 2 "Barnes Distribution's results reflect the positive effects of the integration and the continuous progress we are making in improving customer service and key performance levels," said A. Keith Drewett, President, Barnes Distribution. Sales at Associated Spring were a record $109.5 million for the first quarter of 2005, up 17 percent, from $93.5 million in the first quarter of 2004. The increase in sales was across most of Associated Spring's key customer market segments and included continued organic growth. DE-STA-CO Manufacturing, which was acquired on September 17, 2004, contributed approximately $8.4 million in sales to Associated Spring's light vehicle and industrial products businesses this period. Sales of nitrogen gas springs increased 17 percent and industrial sales increased 29 percent. Sales into the heavy truck market increased 16 percent. Transplant light vehicle sales continued to outpace direct sales to U.S. automakers, as overall light vehicle sales increased 12 percent. Operating profit grew 24 percent to $9.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2005, compared with $7.6 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by additional sales volume partially offset by higher raw material costs and start-up costs in the new Monterrey, Mexico manufacturing facility, which began production in March. "In the first quarter, Associated Spring continued to see profitable growth in strategic areas, such as nitrogen gas and industrial products, though our legacy domestic automotive business underperformed," said Gregory F. Milzcik, President, Associated Spring. "Operationally, productivity improvements are being implemented throughout the organization to improve financial results and establish a solid foundation for our continued competitiveness and growth." Sales at Barnes Aerospace were a record $53.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, up 8 percent from $49.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2004, driven by strong growth in aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales of $13.2 million grew 45 percent from a year ago, primarily due to the additional volume in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) and maintenance and repair activity in Asia. OEM sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were up modestly from a year ago to $40.5 million. Barnes Aerospace generated record orders of $88.9 million during the first quarter of 2005, up 61 percent, from orders of $55.2 million in the same period a year ago. Commercial orders were up 87% to $55.1 million, while military orders were up 19% to $18.0 million. Included in first quarter orders were approximately $16 million due to early customer orders related to increased raw material lead times. Order backlog reached a record $229.1 million at March 31, 2005, up 50 percent from $153.1 million on March 31, 2004. Operating profit grew 29 percent to $5.8 million in the first quarter 2005, from $4.5 million in the first quarter 2004. The increase in operating profit was driven by the higher sales volume and the higher percentage of sales in the more profitable aftermarket business. "Barnes Aerospace continued its strong results in sales, orders, backlog and operating profits, following record results in the fourth quarter 2004," said Patrick Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. "Our focused efforts in leveraging our products and technologies within the aftermarket business continue to provide the anticipated positive financial results."
Barnes Group Inc. / 3 William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "This was a straightforward quarter from a reported earnings perspective and the financial fundamentals of each of our businesses remain sound - operationally all three businesses contributed to our record results. Our balance sheet remains strong and clearly supports our ongoing growth investments." "Our continued success in the marketplace, combined with focus on specific initiatives have positioned the three businesses for enhanced sales and operating profit growth in 2005. Considering the strong first quarter and current market conditions, we are increasing our full-year estimate of diluted earnings per share to $1.80 to $1.90 from our previous estimate of $1.70 to $1.80," stated Carpenter. The Company changed the method of determining the cost of inventory for certain U.S. locations from LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) to FIFO (First-In, First-Out), effective January 1, 2005. As a result, all inventories are now valued on a FIFO basis. Prior year results have been restated for comparability purposes. There was no effect on first quarter 2004 earnings per share.

Following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the Company's reported change in cash and cash equivalents:
(1)
Footnote:
(1)
Free cash flow ("FCF") is not a measurement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company defines FCF as the increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents (cash available) before dividends, business acquisitions, revenue sharing program payments, common stock repurchases, net proceeds from public equity offerings, net changes in debt and other financing activities. The Company does not intend FCF to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. The Company's definition of FCF may not be comparable with FCF as defined by other companies. The Company believes that FCF provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the Company's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, revenue sharing programs, debt service, repurchases of the Company's stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders. Furthermore, FCF is commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates and, thus, provides useful information to investors. The Company's non-GAAP measure of FCF has limitations depending on its use.

This step to enhance shareholder return is supported by the Company's strong operational and financial performance, and reflects our confidence in our ability to deliver balanced and sustainable profit growth."
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $113.3 million for the second quarter 2005, up 6 percent from $107.1 million from the comparable quarter. Sales growth was driven by continued emphasis on Corporate Accounts and Tier II customer relationships which increased 12 percent and 41 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2005 as compared to the second quarter of 2004.
Operating profit at Barnes Distribution increased 34 percent to $6.6 million in the second quarter 2005 from $4.9 million in the second quarter last year. Higher sales volume and an increase in gross margin reflecting continued improvement in customer service levels and cost savings drove operating profit improvements.
"Barnes Distribution continues to see the benefit of its strategic sales focus and distribution network investments," said A. Keith Drewett, President, Barnes Distribution. "Service levels remain strong and within targeted ranges and distribution costs are steadily improving."
Sales at Associated Spring were $111.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, up 18 percent from $94.6 million in the comparable quarter in 2004. Barnes Precision Valve, formerly known as DE-STA-CO Manufacturing, acquired September, 2004, contributed $8.8 million in sales. In addition, the increase in sales was driven by Associated Spring's specialty operations and dedicated efforts to attract new customers and penetrate existing customers. Sales of nitrogen gas products increased 26 percent. Transportation sales increased 14 percent, which included the light vehicle and heavy-duty truck markets. Other industrial sales grew 24 percent.
Associated Spring's operating profit was $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2005, up 31 percent from $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2004. The improvement in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased sales volume and productivity improvements.
"Profitable growth in our specialty operations continued in the second quarter at Associated Spring, while the domestic legacy spring manufacturing operations continued to underperform," said Gregory F. Milzcik, President, Associated Spring. "The second quarter reflects more progress in improving operationally, while organic growth and productivity improvements are positioning Associated Spring for continued success in the marketplace."
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $58.3 million in the second quarter of 2005, up 9 percent from $53.3 million in the same period a year ago, as both OEM and aftermarket sales grew. OEM sales grew by 6 percent, driven by participation in the GE90-115B engine program which realized sales growth of 64 percent. Maintenance Repair & Overhaul (MRO) sales and aftermarket Revenue Sharing Program (RSP) sales contributed to a 26 percent increase in overall aftermarket sales. During the second quarter, Barnes Aerospace entered into a new aftermarket RSP agreement with a participation fee of $18.5 million, further expanding opportunities in the aftermarket.
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
In the second quarter of 2005, Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $74.8 million. Commercial OEM orders were up 26 percent to $41.3 million, while military OEM orders were up 24 percent to $14.5 million. Order backlog was a record $245.7 million, up 60 percent, from $153.4 million in the comparable period a year ago.
Operating profit was $6.8 million, up 34 percent, in the second quarter, from $5.1 million in the same year-ago period. Operating profit was positively impacted by higher sales volume and the increased percentage of aftermarket activity.
"Barnes Aerospace continued to capitalize on strong industry fundamentals as we realized sales growth in both our OEM and aftermarket businesses," said Patrick Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. "We remain optimistic about continued profitable growth as we leverage our sales growth by focusing on operational efficiencies through our lean manufacturing and six sigma initiatives."
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, commented, "The second quarter was another financially sound quarter for each of our business segments. Their results continue to contribute to Barnes Group's strong balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $32 million in cash, after receiving $18.6 million from the sale of NASCO, and making $23 million in cash payments related to our RSP agreements, bringing the total RSP payments to date to $72.5 million."
For the first six months of 2005, Barnes Group's net sales were $554.3 million, up 11 percent from $499.2 million in the year-ago period. Net income increased 51 percent to $31.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, from $20.9 million or $0.88 per diluted share, in the same period of 2004. Excluding the effects of the gain from the sale of NASCO, net income increased 31 percent to $27.5 million or $1.14 per diluted share.

Footnote:The Company has presented certain financial measurements, excluding the gain on sale of NASCO. During the second quarter 2005, the Company sold its 45 percent interest in NHK-Associated Spring Suspension Components Inc. ("NASCO"), resulting in a pretax gain of $8,892 and an after-tax gain of $4,030.

The sale of NASCO was a discrete transaction. Management believes that providing results, excluding this discrete transaction, is useful to investors when comparing year over year results of operations. Management does not intend results excluding the gain on sale of NASCO to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use.

 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) announced today the sale of $85 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due August 1, 2025. The notes are being sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the Company granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $15 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes.
Bristol, Connecticut, July 26, 2005
 
The notes will be unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and will be convertible, under certain circumstances, into a combination of cash and common stock of the Company. The notes will rank junior in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness and equal in right of payment with any of its other senior subordinated indebtedness. The notes will be effectively subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
The notes will bear interest at the annual rate of 3.75% and beginning on February 7, 2011, the Company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of the notes on the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the notes. The contingent interest payable per note within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading price of a note during the five trading day measuring period.
 
The notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into a combination of cash and common stock of the Company upon certain events, under the following circumstances: during specified periods, if the price of the Company's common stock reaches specified thresholds;
subject to certain limitations, during a specified conversion period if the trading price for the notes falls below certain thresholds; if the Company calls the notes for redemption; or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. The conversion rate will be approximately 23.7029 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $42.19 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted and the Company's total conversion obligation, plus cash or shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation. If certain corporate transactions occur on or prior to February 7, 2011, the Company will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock or, in lieu thereof, the Company may under certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and the related conversion obligation so that the notes will be convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.
 
The notes may not be redeemed by the Company prior to February 7, 2011. Holders of notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of the notes on February 1, 2011, February 1, 2016 and February 1, 2021 and upon certain specified corporate transactions.
 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility, and to the extent any net proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes which may include the repayment or reduction of its other indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and acquisitions. The closing of the sale of the notes is expected to occur on August 1, 2005, and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities. The offering will be made only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The securities to be offered have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and unless so registered may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

"ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to the Company or a subsidiary, any member of any group of organizations described in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (the "Code") of which the Company or such subsidiary is a member.

Each "employee benefit plan" established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and, since the date of such determination letter, to the Company's knowledge, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification. Except as disclosed in the Final Offering Memorandum, neither of the following events has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur: (i) a material increase in the aggregate amount of contributions required to be made to all Plans in the current fiscal year of the Company compared to the amount of such contributions made in the Company's most recently completed fiscal year; or (ii) a material increase in the Company's "accumulated post-retirement benefit obligations" (within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 106) compared to the amount of such obligations in the Company's most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "Plan" means a plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA with respect to which any member of the Company may have any liability.

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof may be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve the indemnifying party from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf

Section 9. Contribution
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective
 
proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by such Initial Purchaser and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding notify the Company and the Trustee, of such default and the Company does not cure such default (and such default is not waived) within the time specified in clauses (f) and (g) above after actual receipt of such notice. Any such notice must specify the default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a
"Notice of Default."
 
Section 6.02. . If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j)) occurs and is continuing (the Event of Default not having been cured or waived), the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Securities to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such accelerated amount shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder) may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, and thereby waive the Events of Default giving rise to such acceleration, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, that have become due solely as a result of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Acceleration
 
Section 6.03. . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
Other Remedies
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
 
Section 6.04. . Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder), may waive any existing or past Default and its consequences except (1) an Event of Default described in clauses (a), (c), (d), and (e) of Section 6.01 or (2) an Event of Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is
Waiver of Past Defaults
 
waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. This Section 6.04 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)1(B) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)1(B) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.
 
Section 6.05. . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction or this Agreement. Prior to taking any action under this Indenture, the Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. This Section 6.05 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)1(A) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)1(A) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.
Control by Majority
 
Section 6.06. . A Securityholder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities, except in case of a Default described under clause (a) of Section 6.01 or a Default due to the non-payment of the principal amount of the Securities, any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, or any accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, unless:
Limitation on Suits
 
 
 
 
 
A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of any other Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over any other Securityholder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Securityholders).
 
Section 6.07. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment and Convert
 
expressed in the Securities or any Redemption Date, Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, and to convert the Securities in accordance with Article 10, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment or the right to convert on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected adversely without the consent of such Holder.
 
Section 6.08. . If an Event of Default described in Section 6.01 clauses (a) through (e) (other than (b)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount owing with respect to the Securities and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any such amount) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
The Company agrees not to object to the Trustee participating as a member of any official committee of creditors of the Company as it deems necessary or advisable.
 
Section 6.10. . Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 6, and, after an Event of Default, any money or other property distributable in respect of the Company's obligations under this Indenture, shall be paid out in the following order:

SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, as the case may be, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and payable on the Securities; and

Section 6.11. . In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding. This Section 6.11 shall be in lieu of Section 315(e) of the TIA and such Section 315(e) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.
Undertaking for Costs
 
Section 6.12. . The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, any accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, on Securities, as contemplated herein, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
 
 
Section 7.01.
Duties of Trustee.
 
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

Section 7.02. . Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01:
Rights of Trustee
 
(a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document (whether in original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

If a Default or Event of Default occurs and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall give to each Securityholder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs, or, if later, within 15 days after it is known to the Trustee, unless such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except in the case of a Default or Event of Default described in clauses (d) and (e) of Section 6.01, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Securityholders. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Default or Event of Default, which notice specifically references this Indenture and the Securities.
Notice of Defaults

Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with May 15, 2006, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), if required by such Section 313(a).

(b) to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses, advances and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and

To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay the principal amount of, or the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price, Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, Interest, Contingent Interest or Additional Amounts, if any, as the case may be, on particular Securities.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company satisfactory in form and substance to the retiring Trustee and the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

Section 7.09. . If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another Person, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person without any further act shall be the successor Trustee, subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
Successor Trustee by Merger

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA Section 310(b).
Eligibility; Disqualification
 
Section 7.11. . The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

Discharge of Liability on Securities
 
Indenture shall, subject to Section 7.07, cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall join in the execution of a document prepared by the Company acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
 
Section 8.02. .

The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.04.

Upon a Public Acquirer Change of Control, if the Company so elects, Holders may convert their Securities (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to conversion set forth in Section 10.01(a)) at the adjusted Conversion Rate described above but shall not be entitled to the increased Conversion Rate described in Section 10.01(c). The Company shall notify Holders of its election in its notice to Holders pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(2) above. Holders may convert their Securities upon a Public Acquirer Change of Control during the period specified in Section 10.01(b)(2). In addition, Holders can also, subject to certain conditions, require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Securities as described in Section 3.08.

Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the applicable Conversion Settlement Distribution delivered upon conversion of any Security. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock with a record date prior to the Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon conversion, a Holder shall receive any accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts to the Conversion Date. The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with any conversion of Securities, but instead shall, subject to Section 10.03 hereof, make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.

(f) By delivering the combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, together with a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares to the Conversion Agent or to the Holder or such Holder's nominee or nominees, the Company shall have satisfied in full its Conversion Obligation with respect to such Security, and upon such delivery, accrued and unpaid Interest, if any, and Contingent Interest, if any, with respect to such Security shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited, and such amounts shall no longer accrue.
 
(g) If a Securityholder delivers a Conversion Notice after the Interest Record Date for a payment of Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, such Securityholder must pay to the Company, at the time such Securityholder surrenders Securities for conversion, an amount equal to the Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any, and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Additional Amounts, if any), that has accrued and shall be paid on the related Interest Payment Date. The preceding sentence shall not apply if (1) the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after an Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date during such period referred to in clause (1) of this paragraph or (3) to the extent of any overdue Interest if any overdue Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to the Securities converted.

(2) the Closing Price of the Common Stock for such day.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect to pay cash to the Holders of the Securities surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares issuable upon conversion of such Securities. If the Company elects to pay cash for all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares in lieu of delivery of the Common Stock, it shall inform the Holders who have surrendered their Securities for conversion through the Trustee of the dollar amount to be satisfied in cash (expressed as a percentage of each Residual Value Share that will be paid in cash in lieu of shares of the Common Stock) at any time on or before the date that is three (3) Business Days following the Conversion Date (), unless the Company has already informed the Holders of its election in connection with an optional redemption of the Securities under Section 3.01. If the Company timely elects to pay cash for any portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Holders of the Securities, each Holder may retract its respective Conversion Notice at any time during the two Business Day period immediately following the Cash Settlement Notice Period (the ). If the Company does not make such an election, no such retraction can be made (and a Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable).

The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities. Instead, the Company shall pay the cash value of such fractional shares based upon the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date. In addition, if the Company chooses to settle all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares in cash in connection with conversions within 20 days prior to Stated Maturity or a specified Redemption Date, the Company shall send, on or prior to Stated Maturity or the specified Redemption Date, as the case may be, a single notice to the Trustee of the Residual Value Shares to be satisfied in cash.
 
The means the product of (1) the Conversion Rate in effect (plus any Additional Shares as described under Section 10.01(c)) and (2) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the Trading Days during the Conversion Reference Period.

The with respect to any Securities means the 20 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the second Trading Day after the Conversion Date, or if the Company elects to pay cash to Holders in lieu of all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares, the second Trading Day after the Conversion Retraction Period ends, except in circumstances where conversions occur within 20 days prior to the Stated Maturity or a specified Redemption Date, in which case the Conversion Reference Period will be the 20 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the fifth Trading Day following the Stated Maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be.
"
Conversion Reference Period
"
 
(b) If a Holder tenders Securities for conversion and the Conversion Value is being determined at a time when the Securities are convertible into Exchange Property, the Conversion Value of each Security shall be determined based on the kind and amount of such Exchange Property and the value thereof during the Conversion Reference Period. Settlement of Securities tendered for conversion after the effective date of any transaction giving rise to Exchange Property shall be as set forth above.
 
For the purposes of this Section, the Closing Price of the Common Stock shall be deemed to equal the sum of (A) 100% of the value of any Exchange Property consisting of cash received per share of Common Stock, (B) the Closing Price of any Exchange Property received per share of Common Stock consisting of securities that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market and (3) the Fair Market Value of any other Exchange Property received per share, as determined by three independent nationally recognized investment banks selected by the Company for this purpose. Settlement (in cash and/or shares) will occur on the third Business Day following the final day of any Conversion Reference Period.
 
Section 10.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time, without duplication, by the Company in accordance with this Section 10.04:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
 
(a) In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution by a fraction,
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting the dividend or distribution; and
 
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination,
 
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.04 is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment or share repurchase plans) to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of such distribution) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day prior to the date upon which such distribution was publicly announced, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options by a fraction,
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options plus (B) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and
 
(ii) the denominator of which is the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options plus (B) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such date.
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or options are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or options, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights, warrants or options are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, warrants or options and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
(c) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on
 
the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
(d) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 10.04(b) and excluding any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 10.04(a)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 10.04(d) called the ), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
"Distributed Assets"
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date; and
 
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock,
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; , , that in the event (1) the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date or (2) the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Record Date exceeds the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock by less than $1.00, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Assets such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Security on the Record Date for such distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.04(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock.

"Trigger Event"
 
future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 10.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10.04 shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 10.04. If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights, warrants or options distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, warrants or options become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights, warrants or options with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, warrants or options without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, warrants or options, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, warrants or options that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, warrants or options (assuming such holder had retained such rights, warrants or options), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, warrants or options that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
 
No adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 10.04(d) in respect of rights, warrants or options distributed or deemed distributed on any Trigger Event to the extent that such rights, warrants or options are actually distributed, or reserved by the Company for distribution to Holders of Securities upon conversion by such Holders of Securities to Common Stock.
 
For purposes of this Section 10.04(d) and Section 10.04(a) and (b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.04(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, warrants or options (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 10.04(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, warrants or options (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.04(a) and (b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except:
 
(A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 10.04(a) and (b), and
 
(B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 10.04(a).
 
If any Distributed Assets requiring any adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.04(d) consists of the Capital Stock, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company which are or in connection with such distribution will be listed or quoted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the Record Date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution shall instead be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate then in effect by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the average of the Closing Prices of such distributed security for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date on the New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted plus (2) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the same Trading Day period and (B) the denominator of which is such average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date on the New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the securities are then listed or quoted.
 
(e) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to a all holders of its Common Stock cash (an ) (excluding (i) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or (ii) any quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of the Common Stock in any fiscal quarter does not exceed $0.22 (such amount being the ); the Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportionate to adjustments to the Conversion Rate (other than for adjustments due to cash dividends)), then, in such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such Extraordinary Cash Dividend by a fraction,

(ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) such Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus (B) the amount per share of such dividend or the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock minus the Dividend Threshold Amount; if an adjustment is required to be made as a result of a cash distribution that is not a regular quarterly dividend, the Dividend Threshold Amount will be deemed to be zero,
 
such adjustment to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; , that in the event the portion of the cash so
provided, however
 
distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Security on such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(f) In case a tender or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the ) tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction,
"Expiration Time"
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the ) and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time, and
"Purchased Shares"
 
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time,
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
 
(g) In case of a tender or exchange offer made by a Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership of Common Stock to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Common Stock outstanding and shall involve the payment by such Person of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the )
"Offer Expiration Time

tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Offer Expiration Time, and in which, as of the Offer Expiration Time the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Offer Expiration Time by a fraction,
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Offer Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the ) and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Accepted Purchased Shares) at the Offer Expiration Time and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Offer Expiration Time, and

such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Offer Expiration Time. In the event that such Person is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 10.04(g) shall not be made if, as of the Offer Expiration Time, the offering documents with respect to such offer disclose a plan or intention to cause the Company to engage in any transaction described in Section 10.05.
 
(h) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 10.04, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any U.S. federal income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock (or rights to acquire Capital Stock) or any event treated as such for income tax purposes; , however, that such increase in the Conversion Rate shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account U.S. federal income tax and other consequences of such increase).
provided
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of
 
record of the Securities a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it shall be in effect.
 
(i) All calculations under this Article 10 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth of a share, as the case may be, with one half-cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment requires an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Rate. However, any adjustments which are not required to be made because they would have required an increase or decrease of less than 1.0% shall be carried forward and be made on the first to occur of (i) any subsequent adjustment, (ii) the first day of the next calendar year and (iii) upon any conversion of the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment need be made for:
 
(i) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan,
 
(ii) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
 
(iii) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Securities were first issued,
 
(iv) a change in the par value of the Common Stock, or
 
(v) accrued and unpaid Interest, including Contingent Interest or Additional Amounts, if any.
 
To the extent the Securities become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than Capital Stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities.
 
(j) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(k) In any case in which this Section 10.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 10.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights, warrants or options pursuant to Section 10.04(b), (4) the effective date of any subdivision or combination of Common Stock, (5) the Expiration Time for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.04(f), or (6) the Offer Expiration Time for a tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.04(g) (each a ), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the relevant Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the Holder of any Security converted after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 10.04(a). For purposes of this Section 10.04(k), the term shall mean:

"Adjustment Event"
 
(i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
 
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
 
(iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights, warrants or options,
 
(iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date of such subdivision or combination, and
 
(v) in any case referred to in clause (5) or clause (6) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
 
(l) For purposes of this Section 10.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
Section 10.05. . (a) If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination to which Section 10.04(c) applies or a change in par value), (ii) any consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive Exchange Property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case, as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
 
be entitled to receive Exchange Property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 10. If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, the Exchange Property receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
 
(b) The Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities converted following the effective date of any such transaction, shall be calculated (as provided in clause (c) below) based on the Exchange Property assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of Exchange Property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance (that, if the Exchange Property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (), then for the purposes of this Section 10.05 the Exchange Property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance for each Non- Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-Electing Shares).
provided
"Non-Electing Share"
 
(c) The Conversion Obligation in respect of any Securities converted following the effective date of any such transaction shall be computed in the same manner as set forth in Section 10.03(a) and, if the Securities become convertible into Exchange Property, Section 10.03(b), that any amount of the Conversion Settlement Distribution to be delivered in shares of Common Stock shall be paid in Exchange Property rather than shares of Common Stock. If the Exchange Property includes more than one kind of property, the amount of Exchange Property of each kind to be delivered shall be in the proportion that the value of the Exchange Property (as calculated pursuant to Section 10.03) of such kind bears to the value of all such Exchange Property. If the foregoing calculations would require the Company to deliver a fractional share or unit of Exchange Property to a Holder of Securities being converted, the Company shall deliver cash in lieu of such fractional share or unit based on the value of the Exchange Property.
provided,
 
(d) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder of Securities, at its address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
 
(e) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, binding share exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this Section 10.05 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 10.04 shall not apply.
 
Section 10.06. . The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof, except for applicable withholding, if any. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Securities converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Shares Issued
 
Section 10.07. (a) The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion.
Reservation of Shares
, Shares to Be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock.
 
(b) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company shall take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
 
(c) (i) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities shall upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
 
(ii) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company shall in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
 
Section 10.08. . The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same.

The Securities shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof at a rate of 3.75% per year. The Company shall pay Contingent Interest, if any, as set forth in the Indenture and in Section 3 hereof. The Company shall also pay Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in Section 4.07 of the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement.
 
Interest shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to Holders at the close of business on the preceding Interest Record Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall pay Interest to the Securityholder of record on the Interest Record Date even if the Company elects to redeem or Securityholders elect to require the Company to repurchase, the Securities on a date that is after an Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In that instance, the Company shall pay accrued and unpaid Interest on the Securities being redeemed to, but not including, the Redemption Date, the Repurchase Date or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, to the Securityholder of record on the Interest Record Date.
 
If the principal amount of any Security, or any accrued and unpaid Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any, are not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to Section 5 hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price pursuant to Section 6 hereof, upon the Stated Maturity of the Securities, upon the Interest Payment Dates or upon the Additional Amounts Payment Dates (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear cash interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable in cash on demand but if not so demanded shall be paid quarterly to the Holders on the last day of each quarter.
 
2. Method of Payment.
 
Except as provided below, the Company shall pay Interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on (i) Global Securities, to DTC, or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof, in immediately available funds, (ii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 or less, by check mailed to the Holder of such Security and (iii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount of more than $2,000,000, by wire transfer in immediately available funds if requested by the Holder of any such Security as least five business days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.
 
At Stated Maturity, the Company shall pay Interest on Certificated Securities at the Company's office or agency maintained for that purpose, which initially shall be the office or agency of the Trustee located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall make payments in cash in respect of Redemption Prices, Repurchase Prices, Fundamental Change Repurchase Prices and at Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company shall pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money.
 
3. Contingent Interest
 
The Company shall pay Contingent Interest under the circumstances and in the amounts described in Article 12 of the Indenture. Such Contingent Interest, if any, shall be payable in the same manner, at the same time, and subject to the same restrictions, including those restrictions in respect of accrued and unpaid interest on any Securities that are submitted for conversion, as payments of Interest.

The Securities are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on or after February 7, 2011 upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail for a redemption price (the ) equal to the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
"Redemption Price"
 
In no event shall any Security be redeemable before February 7, 2011.
 
6. Purchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase, at the option of the Holder, all or any portion of the Securities held by such Holder on February 1, 2011, February 1, 2016 and February 1, 2021 in integral multiples of $1,000 at a Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Repurchase Date. To exercise such right, a Holder shall deliver to the Paying Agent a Repurchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to such Repurchase Date until the close of business on the Repurchase Date, and shall deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture.
 
At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the Securities held by such Holder after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change for a Fundamental Change Repurchase Price equal to the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date.
 
Holders have the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
 
If cash sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be, of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Repurchase Date or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent, Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) on and following such Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price upon surrender of such Security.
 
7. Notice of Redemption.
 
Notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5 of this Security shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, immediately on and after such Redemption Date Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.
 
8. Conversion.
 
Subject to the occurrence of certain events and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the conditions to conversion of this Security set forth in Section 10.01 thereof), a Holder is entitled, at such Holder's option, to convert the Holder's Security (or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000), into cash or a combination of cash and fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of conversion.
 
The Company shall notify Holders of any event triggering the right to convert the Securities as specified in the Indenture.
 
A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security, may be converted only if such Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
 
The initial Conversion Rate is 23.7029 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any or accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any. Upon conversion, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any; that if a Conversion Date with respect to any Security occurs between an Interest Record Date for the payment of Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, will be paid to the Holder of record of such Security on such Interest Record Date. Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, delivered upon conversion of any Security. A Holder shall receive, however, accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock, except as set forth in the Indenture.
provided
 
In addition, following certain corporate transactions as set forth in Section 10.01(b) of the Indenture that occur prior to February 7, 2011 and that also constitute a Change of Control, a Holder who elects to convert its Securities in connection with such corporate transaction shall be entitled to receive Additional Shares of Common Stock upon conversion. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may, in lieu of increasing the Conversion Rate by Additional Shares, elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and Conversion Obligation such that from and after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to convert their Securities into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock, as determined pursuant to Section 10.01(d) of the Indenture.
 
To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the Conversion Notice attached hereto (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the
 
Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (4) if required by Section 10.02(g) of the Indenture, pay Interest and Contingent Interest and (5) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
 
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Security, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture.
 
In the event that the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock, (iii) sells or conveys all or substantially all of its property or assets to any Person, and as a result of any such event the Holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive Exchange Property for their Common Stock, upon conversion of the Securities after the effective date of such event, the Conversion Obligation and the Conversion Settlement Distribution shall be based on the applicable Conversion Rate and the Exchange Property, in each case in accordance with the Indenture.
 
9. Subordination
 
To the extent provided in the Indenture, the Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness, as defined in the Indenture, of the Company. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness must be paid before the Securities may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorizes the Trustee to give it effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
 
10. Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.
 
Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar.
 
11. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
 
The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed or any Securities in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased).
 
12. Persons Deemed Owners.
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes.
 
13. Unclaimed Money or Securities.
 
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable abandoned property law. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
17. Calculations in Respect of Securities.
 
The Company or its agents shall be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Securities including, but not limited to, determination of the market prices for the Securities and of the Common Stock and the amounts of Interest, Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, accrued on the Securities.

In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; that the failure to notify the indemnifying party (i) shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) shall not, in any event, relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; that the Holders shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent jointly the Holders and their officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Holders against the Company under this Section 6 if the Holders seeking indemnification shall have been advised by legal counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Holders and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Company, and in that event, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company.

provided, however,
 
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 6(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein, each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "") (or action in respect thereof):
Losses
 
(i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the one hand and a Holder with respect to the sale by such Holder of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the other, or
 
(ii) if the allocation provided by Section (6)(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 6(d)(i)
 
but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and a Holder on the other with respect to such offering and such sale shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, bear to the total proceeds received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities on the other. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Holders on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (e).
pro rata
 
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 6 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 6, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim.
 
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 6(e) are several and not joint.
 
(f) The provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive the sale by a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities.
 
7. The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities
Rule 144A and Rule 144.
 
designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to use its reasonable best efforts to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
 
8. Underwritten Registrations.
 
(a) Any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities who desires to do so may sell Transfer Restricted Securities (in whole or in part) in an underwritten offering; provided that (i) the electing Holders of at least 33

3
% in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities then covered by the Shelf Registration Statement shall request such an offering, (ii) at least such aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be included in such offering; and provided further that the Company shall not be obligated to participate in more than one underwritten offering during the Effectiveness Period and (iii) such Holder does not object to any other Holder including its Transfer Restricted Securities (in whole or in part) in such offering. Upon receipt of such a request, the Company shall provide all Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities written notice of the request, which notice shall inform such Holders that they have the opportunity to participate in the offering. If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority of Holders.
 
(b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Notes on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; and (iii) if such Holder is not then a Notice Holder, such Holder returns a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 2(f) hereof within a reasonable amount of time before such underwritten offering.
 
(c) The Holders participating in any underwritten offering shall be responsible for any underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and, subject to Section 5 hereof, expenses of their own counsel. The Company shall pay all expenses customarily borne by issuers in an underwritten offering, including but not limited to filing fees, the fees and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants and any printing expenses incurred in connection with such underwritten offering.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of Section 4(b)(xxiii) hereof, upon receipt of a request from the Managing Underwriter or a representative of holders of a majority of the Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in an underwritten offering to prepare and file an amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus in connection with an underwritten offering, the Company may delay the filing of any such amendment or supplement for up to 90 days if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith that the Company has a bona fide business reason for such delay.
 
9. Miscellaneous.
 
(a) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 2 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely, and that, in the event of any such failure, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided to it herein, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Section 2 hereof.

Bristol, Connecticut, October 24, 2005---
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE:B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Net sales for the third quarter 2005 were $271.5 million, up 11 percent from $243.9 million in the third quarter 2004. Net income increased 81 percent to $17.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005 from $9.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004. Net income from operations, excluding retroactive tax benefits and a positive out-of-period adjustment related to accounts payable, would have been $13.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share
1
, a 42 percent increase from $9.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago quarter.
Included in Barnes Groups third quarter results were retroactive tax benefits of multi-year Pioneer Status granted by the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry, for the production of aircraft engine components for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the spare parts market. The tax benefits include approximately $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share for the first half of 2005, and approximately $1.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the periods prior to January 1, 2005, for a total retroactive tax benefit of approximately $2.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share. A second item is an out-of-period $1.8 million favorable pre-tax adjustment related to accounts payable. The related after-tax impact is approximately $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

Operating income grew 47 percent to $22.6 million for the third quarter 2005 from $15.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Operating income, excluding the positive adjustment related to accounts payable, was $20.8 million

, a 36 percent increase, from $15.4 million in the third quarter 2004.

Please reference the Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation at the end of this press release.
 
 
 
This marks the 11
th
consecutive quarter in which Barnes Group has posted double-digit sales growth over the comparable prior year quarter, said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. We had a strong third quarter with solid growth in all three business segments, as the organization continues to focus on reducing operational costs and improving after-tax operating results.
Considering the strong first three quarters and current market conditions, we are increasing our full-year 2005 estimate of diluted earnings per share to $2.15 - $2.20. This excludes the benefits from the gain on the sale of NASCO in the second quarter, retroactive Pioneer Status tax benefits and the positive adjustment related to accounts payable, Carpenter continued.
Sales at Barnes Distribution were a record $114.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, up 7 percent, or $7.0 million, from $107.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2004, including $2.1 million from the Toolcom acquisition, which was announced in August 2005. Sales from Corporate Accounts and Tier II were up 10 percent and 39 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2005, compared to the third quarter of 2004.
Barnes Distribution reported operating profit of $8.6 million. Excluding the accounts payable adjustment, operating profit would have been $6.8 million
1
, up 17% in the third quarter, compared with $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume and the beneficial effects of the distribution networks increased operational effectiveness.
Barnes Distribution continues to realize benefits from its strategic sales focus and distribution network investments, said A. Keith Drewett, President, Barnes Distribution. As the operational improvements and global sourcing capabilities accelerate, we expect to improve profitability and expand the range of products and services we offer our customers.
Sales at Associated Spring were $100.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, up 14 percent from $88.3 million in the third quarter of 2004. Specialty operations including Nitrogen Gas Products and Seeger-Orbis Retaining Rings continued strong sales growth. Barnes Precision Valve contributed an incremental $6.1 million to Associated Springs sales in the third quarter of 2005.
Associated Springs operating profit increased 55 percent to $6.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2005, compared with $4.3 million in the comparable quarter last year. Driving this improvement was the increase in profit contribution from specialty operations, partially offset by higher than anticipated domestic operating costs.
 
In the third quarter, Associated Springs specialty operations continued to generate strong top and bottom line growth, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President, Associated Spring. We continue to be focused on profitable sales, and improvements to the operational effectiveness of our domestic legacy spring business.
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were a record $59.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, up 15 percent from $51.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Sales were up in the OEM and aftermarket segments 9 percent and 36 percent, respectively, in the third quarter 2005, compared to the third quarter 2004. Orders were down slightly to $69.8 million in the third quarter from $73.1

million in the prior-year quarter. Backlog increased 46 percent to $255.7 million at September 30, 2005, compared to $174.9 million in the year-ago quarter.
Operating profit at Barnes Aerospace grew 36 percent to $7.4 million in the third quarter, from $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in operating profit was driven by higher sales volume and an increased percentage of higher margin aftermarket activity.
Barnes Aerospace continued its strong results with record sales, operating profit and backlog in the third quarter of 2005, said Patrick Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. This was a balanced quarter with growth in both the OEM and aftermarket businesses. Focusing on leveraging our products and technologies, Barnes Aerospace continues to provide positive financial results.
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.s Chief Financial Officer, commented, We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the third quarter 2005 with a successful $100 million, 3.75 percent convertible senior subordinated debt offering. And, our debt to capitalization ratio at quarter-end of 42 percent was at the low end of our targeted range, even after using $36.0 million in cash for the Toolcom and Service Plus Distributions (SPD) acquisitions and for aerospace aftermarket RSP payments during the quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, Barnes Group net sales were $825.8 million, up 11 percent from $743.1 million in the comparable period in 2004. Net income increased 60 percent to $48.9 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, from $30.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Net income, excluding the gain on the sale of NASCO, retroactive tax benefits and the positive out-of-period adjustment related to accounts payable, was $42.2 million, or $1.74 per diluted share
1
, a 38 percent increase from $30.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share in the comparable year-ago period.
Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss third quarter results at 9:30 a.m. EDT today. A web cast of the live call, supporting materials and an archived replay will be available on the Barnes Group investor relations link at www.barnesgroupinc.com.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. For the full year 2005, Barnes Groups net sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the Companys 148-year history. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 11 percent from $994.7 million in 2004. Reported net income for the full year 2005 was a record $60.5 million or $2.48 per diluted share.
Bristol, Connecticut, February 16, 2006---
Adjusted net income increased 46 percent to $54.3 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to adjusted net income of $37.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share in 2004.
References in this release to adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and adjusted operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures. The 2005 references exclude the gain on the sale of the NASCO joint venture interest, retroactive tax benefits, a positive out-of-period adjustment related to accounts payable, and the cumulative effect of the fourth quarter 2005 change in accounting principle. The 2004 references to these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain charges related to severance, inventories and facilities that occurred in the fourth quarter. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Reconciliation at the end of this press release for detailed reconciliations to amounts reported in accordance with GAAP.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $276.4 million, up 10 percent from $251.6 million in the fourth quarter 2004. Adjusted net income increased 79 percent to $12.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2005 from an adjusted net income of $6.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the previous fourth quarter.
Last year was a banner year for Barnes Group. The Company exceeded $1 billion in sales for the first time. Sales in the fourth quarter were also at record levels, said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer. Solid sales growth, driven by organic growth, provided the foundation for terrific year-over-year improvements in operating income and net income. Our full
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 2
 
year results in all three business segments reflect strong operational execution in support of our objective of balanced, sustainable, profitable growth.
 
The Companys situation is dramatically stronger as we enter 2006. The Companys targeted earnings for the full year 2006, based on current market conditions, are in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per diluted share, added Carpenter.
 
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $112.8 million for the fourth quarter 2005, up 8 percent from 
$104.2 million in the same quarter last year. Driving this growth were increases in U.S., Canadian and European operations as well as Raymond Distribution. Barnes Distribution Raymond and Barnes Distribution Europe included the third quarter acquisitions of Service Plus Distributors, Inc. and Toolcom Supplies Ltd., respectively. Barnes Distributions key growth initiatives, Corporate Accounts and Tier II, posted double-digit sales increases in the fourth quarter, up 10 percent and 54 percent, respectively, as compared to last year.
Reported operating profit for Barnes Distribution in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $5.3 million, up from an adjustedoperating profit of $1.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong improvement in adjusted operating profit was due to higher sales volume, improved gross margin, and a decrease in distribution costs.
 
For all of 2005, sales at Barnes Distribution were $453.8 million, up 7 percent from $424.8 million in 2004. Adjusted operating profit for 2005 was $24.6 million, up 53 percent from an adjusted operating profit of $16.1 million last year, due to higher sales volume and improved gross margins driven by costs savings and operational improvements.
Barnes Distribution continues its strategic focus on sales and operational improvements, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution. With continued distribution network improvements, decreasing distribution costs and service levels sustained at targeted ranges, Barnes Distribution is well positioned to execute its growth initiatives in 2006.
Sales at Associated Spring were $101.1 million in the fourth quarter 2005, up 4 percent from $97.0 million in the comparable quarter in 2004. Associated Springs reported operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $5.5 million, down slightly compared to an adjusted operating profit of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease in reported operating profit compared to last years adjusted amount was primarily due to higher than anticipated domestic operational costs in its traditional spring operations, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume.
For all of 2005, sales at Associated Spring were $422.4 million, up 13 percent from $373.5 million in 2004. Reported operating profit for 2005 grew 25 percent to $32.1 million, from an adjusted operating profit of $25.6 million in 2004. The increase was driven in large part by the profit contribution on higher sales volume from the specialty operations and incremental sales from the Barnes Precision Valve acquisition.
Fourth quarter and full year sales were at record levels, said Gregory F. Milzcik, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Associated Spring. Associated Spring continues to focus on strengthening financial results by generating profitable sales, growing high potential businesses, and improving the underperforming domestic traditional spring operations.
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
 
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $64.2 million for the fourth quarter 2005, up 25 percent from $51.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Generating this sales growth in the fourth quarter was an 18 percent increase in Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sales and a 48 percent increase in Aftermarket sales including Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs). Orders for Barnes Aerospace in the fourth quarter were $77.7 million, compared to $71.5 million in the previous fourth quarter. Backlog increased to a record $269.3 million.
Operating profit increased 32 percent to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter 2005 from $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The strong improvement in operating profit was driven by higher sales volume, an increased percentage of aftermarket activity, and operational improvements from Six Sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives.
For all of 2005, sales at Barnes Aerospace were $235.4 million, up 14 percent from $205.9 million in 2004. Operating profit increased 33 percent in 2005 to $28.4 million from $21.4 million in 2004, driven by the increased sales volume particularly from the higher margin aftermarket RSPs and the increase in MRO sales.
 
Barnes Aerospace achieved records in sales, orders, backlog and operating profit in 2005, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. During 2006, Barnes Aerospace will continue its focus on accelerating profitable growth by adding capacity through improved productivity, capital initiatives, and the transition of selected manufacturing activities to Singapore.
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.s Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, commented, All three businesses contributed to our record results. These results reflect the leverage the Company can achieve when all three businesses demonstrate balanced, sustainable, and profitable growth. With the recent realignment of our international operations and a strong balance sheet, we have strengthened our ability to implement our key global growth initiatives.
Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2005 results at 1:30 p.m. ET today. A webcast of the live call, supporting materials, and an archived replay will be available on the Barnes Group investor relations link at www.barnesgroupinc.com.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement
On February 15, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") took the following actions:
A. Executive Compensation.
The Compensation Committee took the following actions with respect to the named executive officers of the Company as determined as of December 31, 2005 (the "named executive officers").
 
 
Restricted Stock Units
Each restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive, without payment to the Company, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock") equal to the number of restricted stock units that become vested and to receive dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Common Stock on each date on which a dividend is paid to the holders of Common Stock. The restricted stock units vest 33.34% on August 15, 2008 and 33.33% on each of August 15, 2009 and August 15, 2010; provided, that upon a change in control of the Company, all of the restricted stock units shall vest.
The restricted stock units become non-forfeitable in the event the holder retires on or after February 15, 2008; provided, that the holder is at least 62 years old and has at least five years of service (a "Qualified Retirement") and executes a covenant not to compete and release of claims.
The restricted stock units will be accelerated and become payable upon termination of the holder due to the holder's death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the holder's termination for any other reason, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be forfeited.
Performance Share Awards
The performance share awards are to be earned as follows: 33.34% for fiscal year 2006 and 33.33% for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008, upon attainment of designated earnings per share; provided, that upon a change in control of the Company, all of the performance share awards shall be deemed to be earned.
In the event of a voluntary termination, involuntary termination with or without cause or a Qualified Retirement, the holder shall forfeit all unearned performance share awards. In the event of termination due to death or disability, any performance share unit awards earned in the year of such termination shall be paid and the reminder shall be forfeited.
On or about March 1 of each year following the year in which the performance share awards are earned, the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of earned awards will be delivered to the named executive officers. Dividend equivalents on all earned performance share unit awards will be paid based upon dividends paid on outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Stock Options
The stock options shall vest at the rate of 33.34% on August 15, 2007 and 33.33% on each of August 15, 2008 and August 15, 2009. The exercise price of each stock option is $ 37.255, the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the date of the grant, determined in accordance with the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan.
In the event of a termination due to death, disability or a change in control of the Company, the stock options will become exercisable in full. In the event of a death or disability termination, the stock options may be exercised within one year of such termination.
In the event of an involuntary termination without cause, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options. In the event of an involuntary termination for cause all stock options are forfeited. In the event of a voluntary termination, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and vested options shall terminate as of the last day of employment.
In the event of a Qualified Retirement on or after February 15, 2007, so long as the holder executes a covenant not to compete, stock options shall continue to vest as scheduled. If the holder does not execute such covenant, unvested stock options shall be forfeited. If the holder also executes a release of claims, the holder shall have five years from the retirement date to exercise vested stock options. If the holder does not execute such release, the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options.
Other action
With respect to performance share awards granted to Mr. E.M. Carpenter in 2003, 2004 and 2005 that are to be earned in 2005 and 2006 upon attainment of targeted earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the shares available to be earned for fiscal 2005, 64,000 shares, had been earned.
With respect to performance share awards granted to each of Messrs. Arrington, Denninger and Goodrich, and Ms. Gates in 2005 that are to be earned in 2005, 2006 and 2007 upon attainment of targeted earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the shares available to be earned for fiscal 2005, 2,000 shares for each of Mr. Arrington, Mr. Goodrich and Ms. Gates and 2,500 shares for Mr. Denninger, had been earned.
The Compensation Committee approved the following with respect to the named executive officers.
 
The Compensation Committee granted the following cash bonuses pursuant to the Company's Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Executive Officers ("PLBP") to the named executive officers. The grants were based on target 2005 revenue and earnings per share levels set on February 16, 2005 by the Compensation Committee.
 
The Compensation Committee established the target revenue and earnings per share amounts with respect to bonus payouts under the PLBP for fiscal year 2006 at their December 15, 2005 meeting.
B. Director Compensation
On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of 1,610 restricted stock units under the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan to each director who immediately after the 2006 Annual Stockholders Meeting will be a continuing non-management director. These restricted stock units vest as follows: 50% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date. The restricted stock units immediately vest in full in the event of a change in control or the Director's death, disability or retirement from the Board of Directors at the annual meeting of stockholders following his or her attainment of age 70. Dividend equivalents equal to the dividend per share are paid on each restricted stock unit on each dividend payment date.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 15, 2006, Barnes Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Mr. Eugen Hnggi ( the "Seller"). The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company, or one or more of its subsidiaries, will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Heinz Hnggi AG, Stanztechnik, a Swiss corporation ("Heinz Hnggi"), for CHF 162,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). Of the Purchase Price, CHF 122,000,000 (or approximately US$ 92,606,649 based on the exchange rate of CHF 1.3174/$ on March 10, 2006) of the Purchase Price is to be paid in cash. The balance is to be paid in the form of 814,338 shares of common stock, par value $.01, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). Such number of shares of Common Stock was determined using an average of the daily mid-point price of a share of Common Stock for the 30 trading days from January 27, 2006 to and including March 10, 2006 and using an average exchange rate for such period; provided, that such number of shares of Common Stock will be adjusted if prior to the closing of the acquisition the Company declares a stock dividend or makes distributions upon or subdivides, splits up, reclassifies or combines its Common Stock, or declares a dividend or makes a distribution on the Common Stock in any security convertible into Common Stock. Each of the parties to the Purchase Agreement has made representations and warranties and agreed to indemnification obligations customary for transactions of the type contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also provides for a non-competition covenant from the Seller and a post-closing consulting relationship between Heinz Hnggi and the Seller. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions including approval by the German Federal Cartel Office.
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
As described in Item 1.01 above, in connection with the acquisition of Heinz Hnggi, at and subject to the closing of the transaction, the Company is to issue shares of Common Stock to the Seller as part of the Purchase Price. The Common Stock to be issued to the Seller is to be issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Regulation S. The Company is relying upon the representations and warranties of the Seller, including his agreement with respect to restrictions on resale, in support of the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation S. Certificates representing the Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will bear restrictive legends.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On March 15, 2006, the Company issued a press release that announced it had entered into the Purchase Agreement. That release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Bristol, Connecticut, April 20, 2006
Periods prior to January 1, 2006 have been restated to reflect the change in accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS 123R). The impact to the first quarter 2005 was a reduction of pre-tax income by $2.1 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.06.
Barnes Group had record first quarter sales with organic growth in all three businesses generating strong advances in operating income and net income, said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. With 13 consecutive quarters of significant increases in sales over the comparable prior year quarter, and strong operating performance by each of the three businesses, we continue to demonstrate our ability to achieve our objective of balanced, sustainable, profitable growth.
With the first quarter results exceeding our expectations, we are increasing our full-year estimate of diluted earnings per share to $2.55 to $2.65, from the previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60. We continue to expect results to be seasonally impacted, in as much as the first half of the year is traditionally stronger than the second half of the year, and are cautiously optimistic for continued growth in key end markets and geographies, continued Carpenter.
Barnes Group Inc. / 2
 
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.s Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, commented, We continue to make strides in improving the financial performance of the Company and our strong capital position provides the flexibility for continued growth investments.
Sales at Barnes Distribution were a record $124.4 million in the first quarter 2006, up 10 percent from $113.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. Driving the sales growth were strong increases in Barnes Distribution Europe and Barnes Distribution Raymond primarily as a result of the Toolcom and SPD acquisitions, respectively, which added $5.9 million in sales in the first quarter. In addition, Barnes Distribution North Americas continued growth in Corporate Accounts, up 11 percent, and Tier II, up 37 percent, as well as higher selling prices added to top line growth.
In the first quarter of 2006, operating profit at Barnes Distribution increased 74 percent to $9.0 million, up from $5.2 million for the first quarter 2005. Continued operating profit improvements reflect higher sales volume and increased gross margins.
Barnes Distribution made significant progress this quarter towards realizing the benefits of its strategic focus on profitable sales and operational improvements throughout the organization, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution. Steady execution and continued reductions in operating costs are expected to further enhance profitability at Barnes Distribution.
Sales at Associated Spring were $111.0 million in the period ended March 31, 2006, up 1 percent from $109.5 million in the same quarter last year. Specialty operations sales were essentially flat from the prior period, while the traditional spring business realized a modest sales improvement. Associated Springs operating profit for the first quarter 2006 increased 23 percent to $10.6 million, from $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in operating profit reflects a continued focus on profitable sales and actions focused on lowering overall operating costs.
Associated Springs first quarter results reflect the continued benefits of our sales and marketing strategy initiated last year. The organization remains committed to profitable growth and improvements in operational effectiveness of the business while providing high quality products and customer service, said Gregory F. Milzcik, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Associated Spring.
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $66.9 million in the first quarter 2006, up 25% from $53.7 million in the year-ago period as both OEM and aftermarket sales grew. OEM sales increased by 21 percent and aftermarket sales grew by 37 percent.
Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $72.5 million, down from $88.9 million in the prior year which was favorably impacted by approximately $16 million due to a one-time increase in lead times for certain raw materials. Commercial OEM orders were $41.0 million, military orders were $8.8 million and industrial gas turbine orders were $2.1 million in the first quarter 2006. Order backlog was $274.6 million, up 2 percent since December 31, 2005.
In the first quarter 2006, operating profit increased 63 percent to $8.5 million from $5.2 million in the first quarter 2005. Driving the strong increase in operating profit were higher sales volume and an increased percentage of high margin aftermarket sales.
Strong end markets in both OEM and aftermarket businesses led Barnes Aerospace to record results in the first quarter, said Patrick Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. We continue to improve operations and increase capacity through capital investments and increased efficiencies achieved

Of the Purchase Price, CHF 122,000,000 (or approximately US$ 100.7 million based on the exchange rate of CHF 1.212/US dollar on May 16, 2006) was paid in cash. The balance was paid in the form of 814,338 shares of common stock, par value $.01, of the Company (the "Common Stock").

Bristol, Connecticut, July 20, 2006---
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Net sales for the second quarter were $308.9 million, up 10 percent from $280.5 million in the second quarter of 2005. Operating income increased 31 percent to $28.7 million in the second quarter 2006, from $22.0 million in the second quarter in the prior year.
Net income for the second quarter 2006 was $18.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $17.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted shared in the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted second quarter 2005 net income was $14.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. The adjusted second quarter 2005 results excluded an after-tax gain of approximately $4.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, on the sale of a joint venture interest and included approximately $0.01 per diluted share for the Singapore tax benefit reclassification realized in the third quarter of 2005.
References in this release to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures and are detailed on the non-GAAP financial reconciliations at the end of the press release.
Barnes Groups second quarter results include double-digit top line growth, with record sales in excess of $300 million, and strong results in operating income and net income, said Edmund M. Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. These results highlight the fundamental operating strength of our combined businesses and our demonstrated ability to achieve our objective of balanced, sustainable, profitable growth.
Based on the strong results of the first two quarters and current market conditions, we are maintaining our full-year 2006 estimate of diluted earnings per share at $1.28 - $1.33, Carpenter continued.
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 2
 
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.s Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, commented, Barnes Group had another solid quarter even though results were adversely affected by approximately $0.01 per diluted share from the impact of the Heinz Hnggi acquisition, including the effects of purchase accounting and additional shares issued. Earnings per share were also impacted by approximately $0.01 due to an increase in average diluted shares related to employee stock plans.
A key accomplishment in the quarter was the new credit facility which increased our borrowing capacity, providing additional flexibility to execute our strategic growth initiatives, continued Denninger.
 
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $125.5 million in the second quarter of 2006, up 11 percent from $113.3 million in the same quarter last year. Driving sales growth were increases in Barnes Distribution North America, up 6 percent, as a result of increases in Corporate Accounts, up 11 percent, and Tier II, up 33 percent, along with increased selling prices. In addition, Barnes Distribution Europe and Barnes Distribution Raymond, up 39 percent and 32 percent, respectively, were bolstered by the Toolcom and SPD acquisitions which added $6.3 million in sales in the second quarter.
Operating profit at Barnes Distribution in the second quarter 2006 increased 51 percent to $8.9 million, up from $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2005. Driving the strong improvement in operating profits were higher sales volume and improved gross margins as a result of higher selling prices, operational improvements and cost savings.
Barnes Distribution continues its strategic focus on sustainable sales growth and improvements to operations, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution. We are committed to optimizing operational efficiencies throughout the organization for enhanced profitability.
Barnes Distribution recently announced its agreement to acquire KENT. This acquisition will enlarge Barnes Distributions footprint in Europe and will complement the Toolcom acquisition made last year.
Sales at Associated Spring were $112.1 million in the second quarter of 2006, up slightly from $111.5 million in the year-ago period. Included in this sales increase was $4.6 million from the acquisition of Heinz Hnggi AG of Switzerland and a $1.4 million favorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales by the traditional spring business were up approximately 3 percent on increased demand in the heavy- duty truck and telecommunications markets, while sales in specialty operations decreased 2 percent.
Operating profit at Associated Spring was $9.2 million for the second quarter 2006, down from $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2005. Operating profit for the quarter was negatively impacted primarily by lower sales volume in specialty operations, offset in part by lower compensation costs.
The improvement in the traditional spring business is being driven by focused efforts in the pricing of products, raw material costs and labor issues, and we remain committed to furthering operational improvements, said Gregory F. Milzcik, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Barnes Group Inc. Growth within specialty operations is expected in the second half based upon an in-depth review of end markets and customers.
Effective July 1, 2006, Jerry W. Burris was appointed President, Associated Spring. Mr. Burris succeeds Gregory F. Milzcik, who was named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company in February.
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
 
We are excited to have Jerry Burris lead Associated Spring. Jerry comes to Barnes Group with more than 20 years of experience in positions with increasing responsibility in sales, marketing, and product management. His strong background and leadership abilities will enable him to continue to address the operational priorities of Associated Spring and drive profitable growth, added Milzcik.
 
 
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were a record $73.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, up 27 percent from $58.3 million in the same period a year ago, as OEM sales were up 17 percent and aftermarket sales grew 58 percent.
Barnes Aerospace generated record orders of $124.6 million in the second quarter, up 66 percent from $74.8 million in the year-ago period. Commercial orders were $85.7 million, military orders were $15.2 million and industrial gas turbine orders were $0.6 million in the quarter end June 30, 2006. Order backlog was $325.8 million, up 33 percent from a year ago, and up 19 percent from March 31, 2006.
Barnes Aerospaces operating profit was $10.6 million in the second quarter 2006, up 68 percent from $6.3 million in the second quarter 2005. Positively impacting operating profit were the higher sales volume and an increased percentage in higher margin aftermarket activity.
Barnes Aerospace continues to realize strong growth in its OEM and aftermarket businesses with record sales and operating profit for the quarter, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. We are focused on pursuing our balanced portfolio strategy with strategic programs for continued profitable growth.
Barnes Aerospace recently announced two new alliances which will strengthen and diversify the business. Barnes Aerospace entered into an agreement with Goodrich to manufacture nozzle components for both engine applications that power the Boeing 787 - the General Electric GEnx and the Rolls Royce Trent 1000. Two additional engine platforms, the Rolls Royce Trent 700 and the International Aero Engines V2500, are also included in this agreement. Barnes Aerospace also expanded it presence in the aftermarket by entering into its ninth aftermarket RSP (Revenue Sharing Program) with General Electric Company.
For the first six months of 2006, Barnes Groups net sales were $608.8, up 10 percent from $554.3 million in the first half of 2005. Net income increased 26 percent to $36.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2006, from $29.1 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the comparable period in 2005. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 increased 40 percent to $36.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, from an adjusted $26.1 million or $0.54 for the six months ended June 30, 2005.

(e) Compensatory Plans
(i) Gregory F. Milzcik Employment Agreement
On December 13, 2006, Mr. Gregory F. Milzcik and Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") entered into an employment agreement (the "Agreement") which sets forth the terms of employment for Mr. Milzcik as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The Agreement is effective as of October 19, 2006 (the "Commencement Date"). A description of the principal terms of the Agreement is set forth below.
Term of Agreement
The term of the Agreement is three years commencing on the Commencement Date, subject to automatic renewal for successive one-year terms unless either party provides 90 days written notice of non-renewal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the employment term extend beyond October 19 of the calendar year in which Mr. Milzcik attains age 65.
Cash Compensation
: Mr. Milzcik will be paid an annual base salary ("Salary") of $600,000, subject to increase from time to time beginning in 2008 in the sole discretion of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").
Salary
: Mr. Milzcik is a participant in the Barnes Group Inc. Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Officers (the "Bonus Plan"). For calendar year 2006, Mr. Milzcik's bonus shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Bonus Plan, applying the Individual Target established for him for 2006, provided that, upon the attainment of the target level of the performance goals previously established by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Bonus Plan, the Committee shall not use its negative discretion to reduce his 2006 annual bonus below $307,500 (the "2006 Target Amount"). The Committee shall limit its use of negative discretion such that Mr. Milzcik shall receive, upon attainment of the maximum level of performance goals, a maximum annual bonus of 300% of the 2006 Target Amount, or a minimum annual bonus of 25% of the 2006 Target Amount upon attainment of the minimum level of performance goals. For 2007, Mr. Milzcik shall have the opportunity under the Bonus Plan to receive an annual bonus equal to:
Bonus
 
 
 
 
For years during the term of the Agreement after 2007, while the Committee shall have the discretion to change the structure and payment terms of Mr. Milzcik's awards under the Bonus Plan at threshold, target and maximum levels of performance, Mr. Milzcik's annual bonus opportunity for each calendar performance year, upon achieving target level performance for such year, shall not be less than 75% of his then current Salary.
Long-Term Incentives
Mr. Milzcik will continue to participate in the Company's long-term incentive plan, with award levels, performance targets, vesting and other terms as established from time to time by the Committee. On or about February 14, 2007 when the Committee is expected to consider stock grants to other employees of the Company, Mr. Milzcik will, subject to his continued employment, be granted under the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the "Stock Plan") a long-term incentive grant with an approximate aggregate "calculated value" equal to 200% of salary ($1.2 million), as follows:
 
 
 
Commencement Award
On the Commencement Date, Mr. Milzcik was granted under the Stock Plan:
 
 
 
Other Benefits
Mr. Milzcik will continue to participate in all benefit plans and perquisites which the Company makes available to senior executives from time to time, on a basis commensurate with position. The Agreement provides that the Company may, at any time or from time to time, amend or terminate any of its employee benefit plans, programs or policies, in which event such amendments and terminations may be applied to Mr. Milzcik in the same manner as to other Company executive officers. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement provides that benefits for Mr. Milzcik shall include, without limitation, the following:
 
 
 
 
Severance
If Mr. Milzcik's employment is terminated by the Company other than for "Cause" (as defined in the Agreement), other than death or disability, or by Mr. Milzcik for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Agreement), he will receive (in the case of Salary, bonus and welfare, paid when such payments would have been provided if Mr. Milzcik's employment had not been terminated):
 
 
 
In addition, (a) all outstanding options to purchase Company stock held by Mr. Milzcik will continue to vest during such two-year period and shall remain exercisable for the lesser of (i) the term of the option and (ii) one
 
year following the expiration of such two-year period, and (b) outstanding restricted stock units or performance shares or performance unit awards held by Mr. Milzcik and granted on or after the Commencement Date shall vest in full (assuming, in the case of performance shares or units, that the applicable performance goal had been achieved at target) as of the date as if Mr. Milzcik's employment continued for such two-year period to the extent such awards would have vested in accordance with their regular vesting schedule.
All post-termination compensation arrangements will conform with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and any other tax, legal or regulatory restrictions in effect at the time of severance.
Change in Control Benefits
 
 
 
 
 
 
Termination of Employment by the Company for Cause or by Mr. Milzcik other than for Good Reason
The Company shall pay Mr. Milzcik his earned and unpaid Salary and any Accrued Post-Employment Benefits as of the date of termination.
Disability/Death
The Company shall pay Mr. Milzcik his earned and unpaid Salary and any Accrued Post-Employment Benefits as of the date of termination and provide Mr. Milzcik or his beneficiary, as applicable, the compensation and benefits made available generally to executive officers of the Company in the event of death or disability under the terms and conditions of the Company's applicable plans, policies, programs or arrangements applicable to executive officers.
 
Restrictive Covenants
Following termination of employment, Mr. Milzcik will not compete with the Company for two years, will not solicit clients or employees of the Company for three years, and will abide by confidentiality, non-disparagement and trade secrets covenants in perpetuity.
Claw-Back
Under specified circumstances up to three years after the end of his employment, Mr. Milzcik shall reimburse the Company for some or all of any amounts (determined as set forth in the Agreement) paid or received (or to be paid or received) in respect of any annual incentive compensation or any long-term incentive compensation awarded to Mr. Milzcik after the Commencement Date, if payment of such compensation was contingent, in whole or in part, upon the achievement of one or more specified financial targets, and the Company implements a Mandatory Restatement (as defined in the Agreement). This provision will not apply to amounts received by Mr. Milzcik with regard to equity-based compensation that has a vesting schedule based on the passage of time and the continued performance of services, and not on the achievement of any performance objectives or to any award granted Mr. Milzcik that has or had alternative vesting criteria unrelated to the performance objectives affected by the Mandatory Restatement that have otherwise been satisfied at the time of the Mandatory Restatement.
If Mr. Milzcik concludes that the amount to be repaid to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement is excessive and inequitable, he may petition the Committee to review that determination. If the Committee agrees with Mr. Milzcik's conclusion, it shall, in its sole discretion, specify an amount to be repaid to the Company that it concludes is equitable and appropriate under the circumstances. If the Committee does not agree that the formula produces a result that is excessive and inequitable, no adjustment shall be made in the amount to be repaid to the Company. The determination, conclusions and other actions of the Committee shall be conclusive.
Indemnification
The Agreement provides that Mr. Milzcik shall be entitled to indemnification for liabilities and expenses to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law to the extent consistent with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.
"Golden Parachute" Excise Tax Provision
To the extent that any payment or distribution to Mr. Milzcik is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Agreement provides that total payments to Mr. Milzcik shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that a reduction in the total payments would result in Mr. Milzcik retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis, than if Mr. Milzcik received the entire amount of such payments.
Fees and Expenses
The Company shall reimburse Mr. Milzcik for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by him in connection with (a) any good faith action brought by Mr. Milzcik to enforce his rights under the Agreement (or to respond to any action commenced by the Company) but only those fees and expenses attributable to claims
 
with respect to which there was a substantial likelihood that Mr. Milzcik would prevail on the merits, and (b) the negotiation and documentation of the Agreement and the other agreements referenced therein.
The above description of Mr. Milzcik's Employment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
(ii) Edmund M. Carpenter Retirement Arrangements
On December 13, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") approved a modification to the written Employment Agreement dated as of December 8, 1998 (the "Employment Agreement") between the Company and Mr. Edmund M. Carpenter under which Mr. Carpenter served as the President and Chief. Executive Officer of the Company until October 19, 2006 and which provides retirement benefits to Mr. Carpenter upon his retirement as Retiring Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of the Company on December 31, 2006. The Committee determined that the modification to the Employment Agreement was necessary and appropriate in order to correct the inadvertent omission from the Employment Agreement of an agreement between the Company and Mr. Carpenter relating to life insurance benefits to be provided Mr. Carpenter following his retirement. The amendment to the Employment Agreement authorized by the Committee will provide that Mr. Carpenter will receive two years of service credit for each one year of actual service under the Company's Senior Executive Enhanced Life Insurance Program (the "Program"). As modified, the Employment Agreement will obligate the Company under the Program to continue to pay premiums on a policy insuring Mr. Carpenter's life until the policy premiums are paid in full paid. The Committee also authorized a further agreement with Mr. Carpenter that permits Mr. Carpenter to waive his right to approximately ten percent of the maximum life insurance benefit (and related income tax "gross-up") to which Mr. Carpenter would be entitled (subject to satisfaction of insurance company underwriting requirements) under his Employment Agreement and the Program in exchange for payments to him in an aggregate amount not to exceed $219,655.17. The Company expects Mr. Carpenter will use such payments for post-retirement secretarial services.

The Executive further understands and acknowledges that the Commencement Options and Commencement Units, the commitment to make 2007 long-term incentive grants and the continued opportunity for the Executive to receive further long-term incentive grants are made or provided by the Company in reliance on the Executive's commitment to comply with such share ownership guidelines.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
4.10 The Executive agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement or in any compensatory plan, agreement, program, policy or arrangement, the Executive shall be responsible for reimbursing the Company for some or all of any amounts paid or received (or to be paid or received) in respect of any annual incentive compensation or any long-term incentive compensation awarded to the Executive after the Commencement Date, whether awarded before or after termination of employment, if (i) payment of such compensation was contingent, in whole or in part, upon the achievement of one or more specified financial targets, and (ii) the Company implements a Mandatory Restatement (as hereinafter defined). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.10 shall not relate to the gain recognized on any stock option, the compensation received in respect of any restricted stock or restricted stock unit grant, or any other variety of equity-based compensation, whether made on, before or after the Commencement Date, that has a vesting schedule based on the passage of time and the continued performance of services, and not on the achievement of any performance objectives. Similarly, this Section 4.10 shall not apply to any award that has or had alternative vesting criteria unrelated to the performance objective affected by the Mandatory Restatement (an "Alternative Vesting Award") that have otherwise been satisfied at the time of the Mandatory Restatement.
Recovery of Amounts Related to Restatement
The amount which the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company shall be the amount, if any, by which the compensation paid or received (or to be paid or received) exceeds the amount that would have been paid or received based on the financial results reported in the restated financial statements, in each case as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee, as constituted at the time of the relevant action; provided, however, that (i) no repayment will be payable in respect of an Alternative Vesting Award where the alternative vesting criteria have not yet been, but can still be, satisfied and the Compensation Committee has determined in good faith that the likelihood that such criteria will be satisfied is not immaterial; provided that the amount that would otherwise have been repaid to the Company in respect of any portion of such Alternative Vesting Award that does not become vested based on such alternative vesting criteria shall be due and payable promptly after the opportunity to satisfy the alternative vesting criteria has expired; (ii) the amount that the Executive shall be
 
required to reimburse the Company from previously received compensation shall be reduced by the Net Tax Cost (as hereinafter defined) to the Executive of such compensation and (iii) to the extent that the price of the Company's common stock is or was a component of the performance objectives upon which the compensation was payable, the value of the stock taken into account for purposes of re-determining the level of achievement based on the restated financial results will be determined by reducing the reported stock prices during each accounting year affected by the Mandatory Restatement by an amount per share equal to the product of (A) the average weekly earnings per share multiples at which the Company's common stock traded for the 52 week period for such accounting year multiplied by (B) the amount by which earnings per share for such accounting year was reduced as a result of the Mandatory Restatement. If the Executive concludes that the amount to be repaid to the Company in accordance with subclause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence is excessive and inequitable, he may petition the Compensation Committee to review that determination. If the Compensation Committee agrees with the Executive's conclusion, it shall, in its sole discretion, specify an amount to be repaid to the Company that it concludes is equitable and appropriate under the circumstances. If the Compensation Committee does not agree that the formula produces a result that is excessive and inequitable, no adjustment shall be made in the amount to be repaid to the Company. The determinations, conclusions and other actions of the Compensation Committee in accordance with the two immediately preceding sentences shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and the Executive, and all persons claiming an interest through either such party.
A "Mandatory Restatement" shall mean a restatement of the Company's financial statements for 2006 or any year thereafter which, in the good faith opinion of the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, is required to be implemented pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, but excluding any restatement which is required with respect to a particular year as a consequence of a change in generally accepted accounting rules effective after the publication of the financial statements for such year. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a Mandatory Restatement shall not include any restatement that (i) occurs more than three years following the date that the Employment Term ends pursuant to Section 5 hereof or (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee"), (A) is required due to a change in the manner in which the Company's auditors interpret the application of generally accepted accounting principles (as opposed to a change in a prior accounting conclusion due to a change in the facts upon which such conclusion was based), or (B) is otherwise required due to events, facts or changes in law or practice that the Audit Committee concludes were beyond the control and responsibility of the Executive and that occurred regardless of the Executive's diligent and thorough performance of his duties and responsibilities. In addition, in determining the amounts, if any, that the Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company pursuant to this Section 4.10 (or that would be payable to the Executive in respect of any then in progress awards), all effects, whether positive or negative, of any change in the
 
manner of reporting any transaction or class of transactions that the Audit Committee shall specifically agree to exclude for this purpose shall be disregarded.
"Net Tax Cost" shall mean the net amount of any federal, foreign, state or local income and employment taxes paid by the Executive in respect of the compensation received that is subject to reimbursement, after taking into account any and all available deductions, credits or other offsets allowable to the Executive (including, without limitation, any deduction permitted under the claim of right doctrine), and regardless of whether the Executive would be required to amend any prior income or other tax returns.
The Executive agrees that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Company may seek reimbursement of such amounts from the Executive and may recapture such amounts by retaining the compensation or other amounts that would otherwise be due or payable to the Executive.
5. . The Executive's employment with the Company and the Employment Term shall terminate upon the expiration of the Employment Term, as specified in Section 1 hereof, or upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events of termination:

The Company may not terminate the Executive's employment for Cause unless such written notice is delivered to the Executive within ninety (90) days of the Board having actual knowledge of the action or omission constituting Cause (it being understood that knowledge by the Executive or any officer who reports to the Executive shall not constitute knowledge by the Board). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following receipt of such notice the Company may place the Executive on an administrative leave pending completion of the process established under this Section 5(b). During the term of such leave, the Executive shall be entitled to receive all compensation and benefits due under this Agreement pending completion of the process described herein, and the consequences of placing the Executive on such leave shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his employment hereunder. "Cause" shall mean () the willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform the Executive's duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, () the willful engaging by the Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or its subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise,

For purposes of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's act, or failure to act, was in the best interest of the Company. The Executive shall have the right to appear before the Board, with his counsel present if he so elects, prior to any final determination by the Board to terminate his employment for Cause. The Executive may request a meeting with the Board by submitting a written request to the Board within ten (10) days of receipt of the Cause Notice. Such meeting with the Board shall be fixed and shall occur on a date selected by the Board (such date being not less than five (5) nor more than twenty (20) days after the Board receives the Executive's written request). Such meeting shall take place at the executive offices of the Company and the Executive shall have the right to address the Board for such period of time as established by the Board, but in no event less than thirty (30) minutes. For all purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause, the effective date of such termination shall be the date of delivery of the Cause Notice.

In the event of termination of the Employment Term, for whatever reason other than Death, () the Executive shall cooperate with the Company and be reasonably available to the Company with respect to continuing and/or future matters arising out of the Executive's employment or any other relationship with the Company (but not to unreasonably interfere with any employment or other business services or activities then being conducted by the Executive), whether such matters are business-related, legal or

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
This Second Amendment to the Employment Agreement dated as of December 8, 1998 between Barnes Group Inc. and Edmund M. Carpenter (the "Employment Agreement") is executed on the 19 day of December, 2006, by and between Barnes Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Edmund M. Carpenter (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, it has recently come to the attention of the Company that the Employment Agreement inadvertently failed to document the unwritten agreement of the parties to the Employment Agreement which was made at the time that the Employment Agreement was entered into, which unwritten agreement has been in effect since that time and was intended by the parties to be embodied in the Employment Agreement, that the Executive was to receive two (2) years of service credit for each one (1) year of actual service under the Company's Officer Enhanced Life Insurance Program referred to in section 4.9 of the Employment Agreement (now the Senior Executive Enhanced Life Insurance Program); and
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive wish to correct the inadvertent failure to document said unwritten agreement; and
WHEREAS, Proposed Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(c)(3)(iii) provides that an unwritten arrangement that was adopted and effective before December 31, 2006, is treated as established as of the later of the date on which it was adopted or became effective, provided that the material terms of the arrangement are set forth in writing on or before December 31, 2006; and
WHEREAS, correcting the inadvertent failure to document said unwritten agreement does not enhance, or add a new benefit or right to, the rights which the parties agreed at the time the Employment Agreement was entered into the Executive would have under the Employment Agreement, and therefore should not constitute a material modification of the Employment Agreement within the meaning of Proposed Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-6(a)(4);
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants contained in the Employment Agreement and herein, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:
1.     Section 4.9(a) of the Employment Agreement is amended, effective as of December 8, 1998, by adding to the end thereof the following sentence:
"Provided the Executive is actually employed by the Company on a continual basis from the Commencement Date until December 8, 2003, the Executive shall receive two (2) years of service credit for each one (1) year of actual service under the Company's Officer Enhanced Life Insurance Program."
 
2.     If (and only if) the amendment set forth in paragraph 1 above is determined to be "the grant of an additional benefit under an existing arrangement that consists of a deferral of additional compensation not otherwise provided under the plan as of October 3, 2004," within the meaning of Proposed Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-6(a)(4)(ii), then in that event the benefits attributable to the Executive's receipt of two (2) years of service credit for each one (1) year of actual service under the Company's Officer Enhanced Life Insurance Program shall be subject to section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, to the end that the amendment will be treated as a material modification of the Employment Agreement only as to the additional deferral of compensation, as provided in that Proposed Treasury Regulation.
3.     Except as amended in paragraph 1 above, the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement as amended by Amendment 1 to the Employment Agreement will continue in full force and effect without change.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed by authority of its Board of Directors, and the Executive has hereunto set his hand, the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
Bristol, Connecticut, February 15, 2007---
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced record financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. For the full year 2006, Barnes Groups net sales were $1.3 billion, up 14 percent from $1.1 billion in 2005. Operating income increased 57 percent to $117.0 million, for the full year 2006, from an adjusted $74.6 million in 2005. Net income for the full year 2006 was $73.8 million or $1.39 per diluted share, up 54 percent from an adjusted $47.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share in 2005.
References in this release to the full year 2005 adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and adjusted operating income are non-GAAP financial measures which are detailed on the non-GAAP financial reconciliations at the end of the press release.
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2006 were $328.8 million, up 19 percent from $276.4 million in the fourth quarter 2005. Operating income increased 86 percent to $29.6 million in the fourth quarter 2006 from $16.0 million in the same period last year. Net income in the fourth quarter increased 83 percent to $18.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $10.1 million or $0.20 per diluted share, in the previous fourth quarter, excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Barnes Group continued its sound performance in the fourth quarter. All three of our business units generated double-digit sales growth. Operating income grew as a result of our operational improvements and continued benefits from strategic acquisitions and alliances, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. Our full year 2006 results provide us with the momentum to build upon our initiatives to achieve continued growth for Barnes Group and increased value for our stockholders.
As we enter 2007, Barnes Group is well positioned for continued growth. The Companys targeted earnings for the full year 2007 are in the range of $1.53 to $1.60 per dilute share, which is in line with our
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 2
 
objective of achieving over time an average of 10 percent to 15 percent annual earnings per share growth, said William C. Denninger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
Fourth quarter 2006 sales at Barnes Distribution were $141.6 million, up 26 percent from $112.8 million in the same period last year. Driving the fourth quarter 2006 sales growth were broad-based increases in Barnes Distribution North America, including double-digit increases in Corporate and Tier II accounts, and gains in Europe and the Raymond division. Barnes Distribution Europes fourth quarter sales were positively impacted by $20.8 million from the second quarter acquisition of KENT. Foreign exchange positively affected sales by $1.9 million in the fourth quarter.
Operating profit in the fourth quarter for Barnes Distribution was $4.5 million, up 9 percent from $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating profits benefited from higher sales volume and a reduction of distribution costs as a percentage of sales and a $1.5 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in Canada. Results were adversely affected by KENT integration activities, which resulted in a $1.7 million severance charge for the planned closure of a distribution center in France.
Full year 2006 sales at Barnes Distribution were $526.9 million, up 16% from $453.8 million in 2005. Operating profit in 2006 was up 52 percent to $31.5 million, compared to an adjusted 2005 operating profit of $20.8 million. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and contributions from acquisitions.
Barnes Distribution surpassed $500 million in sales for the first time, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution. We achieved this significant milestone by a sustained focus on customer service and strategic initiatives.
Fourth quarter 2006 sales at Associated Spring were $110.9 million, up 10 percent, from $101.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in this sales increase were $7.2 million from the recently acquired Heinz Hnggi GmbH and a $2.6 million favorable impact from foreign exchange. End market sales continued to benefit from strong momentum in telecommunications and heavy duty truck. Associated Springs sales within the transportation and industrial markets were essentially flat, excluding the Heinz Hnggi acquisition.
Operating profit was up 190 percent to $13.0 million in the fourth quarter 2006, from $4.5 million in the comparable 2005 quarter. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by contributions from Heinz Hnggi, gross margin improvements and cost containment initiatives.
For all of 2006, sales at Associated Spring were $445.9 million, up 6 percent from $422.4 million in 2005. Operating profit increased 50 percent to $42.9 million, compared to a 2005 operating profit of $28.6 million. Driving this increase were improvements in traditional operations and profit contributions from the recent acquisition of Heinz Hnggi.
Associated Springs fourth quarter results reflect the benefits of our continuing operational improvements throughout the organization, said Jerry W. Burris, President, Associated Spring. We are committed to profitable sales growth and improving operational efficiencies in 2007.
Fourth quarter 2006 sales at Barnes Aerospace were $78.8 million, up 23 percent from $64.2 million in the comparable 2005 quarter as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket sales increased 10 percent and 58 percent, respectively.
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
 
Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $113.7 million in the fourth quarter, up 46 percent from $77.7 million in the same period last year. Commercial OEM orders were $58.4 million and military orders were $26.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Order backlog was $403.0 million, up 10 percent from September 30, 2006.
Operating profit increased 66 percent in the fourth quarter 2006 to $12.2 million, up from $7.3 million in the same period last year. The increase in operating profit was positively impacted by higher sales volume and an increased percentage of higher margin aftermarket activity.
For all of 2006, sales at Barnes Aerospace were $296.9 million, up 26 percent from $235.4 million for the full year 2005. Operating profit for 2006 increased 67 percent to $42.7 million, compared to $25.5 million in 2005.
Barnes Aerospace achieved another year of solid results in 2006 with historical highs in sales, orders, backlog and operating profit, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. Barnes Aerospaces accelerated growth is driven by our continued pursuit of a portfolio strategy that maintains our focus on key aerospace platforms and operational efficiencies that drive sustainable profitable growth.

The Compensation Committee took the following actions with respect to the named executive officers of the Company as determined as of December 31, 2006 (the "named executive officers").

Each restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive, without payment to the Company, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock") equal to the number of restricted stock units that become vested and to receive dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Common Stock on each date on which a dividend is paid to the holders of Common Stock after the grant date. The restricted stock units vest 33.34% on August 14, 2009 and 33.33% on each of August 14, 2010 and August 14, 2011.
The restricted stock units become non-forfeitable in the event the holder retires on or after February 14, 2009; provided, that the holder is at least 62 years old and has at least five years of service (a "Qualified Retirement") and executes a covenant not to compete and release of claims.
The restricted stock units will be accelerated and become payable upon termination of the holder due to the holder's death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the holder's termination for any other reason, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be forfeited.
Performance Share Awards
The performance share awards are to be earned as follows: 33.34% for fiscal year 2007 and 33.33% for each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009, upon attainment of designated basic earnings per share; provided, that upon a change in control of the Company, all of the performance share awards shall be deemed to be earned.
In the event of a voluntary termination, involuntary termination with or without cause or a Qualified Retirement, the holder shall forfeit all unearned performance share awards. In the event of termination due to death or disability, any performance share unit awards earned in the year of such termination shall be paid and the reminder shall be forfeited.
On or about March 1 of each year following the year in which the performance share awards are earned, the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of earned awards will be delivered to the named executive officers.

If the holder does not execute such covenant, unvested stock options shall be forfeited. If the holder also executes a release of claims, the holder shall have five years from the retirement date to exercise vested stock options. If the holder does not execute such release, the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options.
Other Action
With respect to the remaining performance share awards granted to each of Messrs. Milzcik, Carpenter, Denninger, Arrington, and Dempsey and Ms. Gates in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 to be earned in 2006, 2007 and 2008 upon attainment of targeted basic earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the shares granted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and available to be earned for fiscal 2006, and 125% of the shares granted in 2006 and available to be earned in fiscal 2006, had been earned as set forth below:

The Compensation Committee granted the following cash bonuses pursuant to the Company's Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Executive Officers ("PLBP") to the named executive officers.

On March 6, 2007, Barnes Group Inc. ("Barnes" or the "Company") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with the several initial purchasers named therein, in connection with the offer and sale of $85 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.375% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the "Notes"). In addition, Barnes granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference. The offer and sale of the Notes is more fully described in Item 3.02 below. On March 6, 2007, Barnes issued a press release announcing its sale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of $85 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. A copy of this press release is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
On March 6, 2007, Barnes entered into the Purchase Agreement with the several initial purchasers named therein, in connection with the offer and sale of $85 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. In addition, Barnes granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are scheduled to be completed on March 12, 2007.
The aggregate offering price for the Notes was $85 million. Barnes expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $81.90 million (or $96.45 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us, assuming no exercise of the option granted to the initial purchasers. Barnes anticipates that the proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used to repay its outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
The offer and sale of the Notes (and underlying shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share) to the initial purchasers were exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction not involving a public offering. The offer and resales of the Notes by the initial purchasers were made also in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144A thereunder; such offers and sales were made only to "qualified institutional buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, with adequate access to information about the Company, and appropriate notice and legends affixed to the Notes regarding the restricted nature of the Notes.
The Notes are convertible into the Company's common stock at a rate equal to 34.8646 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equal to a conversion price of approximately $28.68 per share), subject to adjustment in the following circumstances:

For purposes of this paragraph, the term "Plan" means a plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA with respect to which any member of the Company may have any liability.

Schedule C
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof may be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve the indemnifying party from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
provided
however
 
and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), reasonably approved by the indemnifying party (or by BAS in the case of Section 8(b) and Section 9), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 90 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements.
Section 9. Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
 
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by such Initial Purchaser and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
Schedule A
Section 10. Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers.
If, on the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Notes set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-
Schedule A
 
defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representative with the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party (other than a defaulting Initial Purchaser) to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.
Section 11. Termination of this Agreement.
On or prior to the Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any federal, New York or Delaware authority or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representative is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company to any Initial Purchaser, except to the extent that the Company is obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representative and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Sections 4 and 7 hereof, or (b) any Initial Purchaser to the Company, , that if the Company reimbursed the Initial Purchasers for their expenses pursuant to Section 7 hereof and the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers are obligated to reimburse the Company for all reimbursements made by the Company to the Representative and the other Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 7 hereof, such obligation to reimburse the Company shall survive.
provided, however
 
Section 12. Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.
The respective indemnities, contribution, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and of the several Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the result thereof, made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Company or any of its or their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, as the case may be, (ii) acceptance of the Notes and payment for them hereunder or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
Section 13. Notices.
All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, hand delivered or telecopied and confirmed to the parties hereto as follows:
 
 
Any party hereto may change the address for receipt of communications by giving written notice to the others.
Section 14. Successors.
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, including any substitute Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 10 hereof, and to the benefit of the employees, officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 and Section 9, and in each case their respective successors, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Notes as such from any of the Initial Purchasers merely by reason of such purchase.
Section 15. Partial Unenforceability.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any Section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other Section, paragraph or provision hereof. If any Section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement is for any reason determined to be invalid or unenforceable, there shall be deemed to be made such minor changes (and only such minor changes) as are necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
Section 16. Governing Law Provisions.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Section 17. No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Initial Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any fiduciary or advisory relationship; and (v) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Initial Purchasers, or any of them,
 
with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty.
Section 18. General Provisions.
No indemnified party shall be entitled to any consequential, special or punitive damages by virtue of Section 8 or 9 of this Agreement except to the extent that such indemnified party is obligated to pay such types of damages to a third party in respect of a claim for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement and supersedes all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each one of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement may not be amended or modified unless in writing by all of the parties hereto. The Section headings herein are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

On March 12, 2007, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") completed the issuance and sale of $100 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.375% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the "Notes") pursuant to a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of March 6, 2007, between the Company and the representative of the several initial purchasers named therein. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company entered into an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of March 12, 2007, by and among the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and a resale registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), dated as of March 12, 2007, by and among the Company and the representative of the several initial purchasers designated therein.
The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the Notes accrues at the rate of 3.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. The Notes are direct, unsecured, senior subordinated obligations of the Company, rank junior in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with any other existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness, including its 3.75% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025. The Notes will be effectively junior to the Company's subsidiaries' existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables. Prior to March 20, 2014, the Notes are not redeemable. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes in cash at its option, at any time after March 20, 2014, upon at least 30 days' notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and additional amounts, if any, up to but not including the date of redemption. In addition, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes on March 15, 2014, March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and additional amounts, if any, up to but not including, the date of repurchase.
If the Company undergoes a fundamental change as defined in the Indenture, holders of the Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and additional amounts, if any, up to but not including, the date of repurchase.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of the Notes have been granted certain registration rights. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to file a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Notes any shares of the Company's
 
common stock issued upon their conversion with the SEC and, if the Company is not eligible to use an automatic shelf registration statement, to use reasonable best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to become effective within 180 days after the first date of original issuance of the Notes. In addition, the Company has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to keep the shelf registration statements effective until the earlier of the sale pursuant to the shelf registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act of all of the Notes and any shares of the Company's common stock issued upon their conversion and the expiration of the holding period applicable to the Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock issued or issuable upon their conversion held by persons that are not the Company's affiliates under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act, or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC. The Company agreed to pay additional amounts if it does not comply with the foregoing obligations.
The foregoing descriptions of the Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2, Exhibit 4.3 and Exhibit 4.4 hereto, respectively, and which are incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
 
On March 12, 2007, the initial purchasers party to the Purchase Agreement exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. With the exercise of the over-allotment option, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued amounted to $100 million, and the Company received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $96.45 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
The information contained in Item 3.02 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2007 regarding the exemption from registration claimed and the terms of conversion of the Notes is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference.

A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate thereof holds the Security; provided, however, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other Act hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or such other obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other act, only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time of such determination shall be considered in any such determination (including, without limitation, determinations pursuant to Article 6 and Article 9).
Outstanding Securities; Determinations of Holders' Action

provided
If a Security is converted in accordance with Article 10, then from and after the time of conversion on the date of conversion, such Security shall cease to be outstanding and Interest, Contingent Interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and the rights of the Holders therein shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Conversion Settlement Distribution).

Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

After the preparation of Certificated Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for Certificated Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of Certificated Securities of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Certificated Securities.
Section 2.10. . All Securities surrendered for payment, purchase by the Company pursuant to Article 3, conversion, redemption or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, other than in connection with registrations of transfer or exchange, or that any Holder has converted pursuant to Article 10. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with the Trustee's customary procedure.

Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice.

At such time, the Company
 
will be required to instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Securities beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per $1,000 original principal amount of Securities is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Closing Price of the Company's Common Stock and the current Conversion Rate of the Securities.
The Trustee shall be entitled at its sole discretion to consult with the Company and to request the assistance of the Company in connection with the Trustee's duties and obligations pursuant to Section 10.01(a) hereof, and the Company agrees, if requested by the Trustee, to cooperate with, and provide assistance to, the Trustee in carrying out its duties under this Section 10.01; , , that nothing herein shall be construed to relieve the Trustee of its duties pursuant to Section 10.01(a) hereof.

In addition, if a Holder converts Securities following the effective time of any such transaction, any amounts of the Conversion Settlement Distribution to be settled in shares of Common Stock shall be paid in such Exchange Property rather than shares of Common Stock.

The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule I hereto shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Securities is adjusted pursuant to Section 10.04. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.04. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum amount of Additional Shares is 12.55 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities, subject to adjustments in the same manner as the conversion rate as set forth in Section 10.04.

The Company shall notify Holders of its election in its notice to Holders pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(2) above. Holders may convert their Securities upon a Public Acquirer Change of Control during the period specified in Section 10.01(b)(2). In addition, Holders can also, subject to certain conditions, require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Securities as described in Section 3.08.

(b) Before any Holder of a Security shall be entitled to convert the same into a combination of cash and Common Stock, if any, such Holder shall (1) in the case of Global Securities, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time for converting a beneficial interest in a Global Security, and in the case of Certificated Securities, surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, and (2) give written notice to the Company in the form on the reverse of such Certificated Security (the "") at said office or place that such Holder elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock included in the Conversion Settlement Distribution, if any, to be registered.
Conversion Notice
Before any such conversion, a Holder also shall pay all taxes or duties, if any, as provided in Section 10.06 and any amount payable pursuant to Section 10.02(g).
If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, that shall be deliverable upon conversion as part of the Conversion Settlement Distribution shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.

Conversion Date
(d) The Company shall, on the Conversion Settlement Date, (i) pay the cash component (including cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled) of the Conversion Obligation determined pursuant to Section 10.03 to the Holder of a Security surrendered for conversion, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, and (ii) issue, or cause to be issued, and deliver to the Conversion Agent or to such Holder, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such Holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock while the stock transfer books for such stock or the security register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or security register, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock as part of the applicable Conversion Settlement Distribution upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock, as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Settlement Date.
(e) In case any Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the
 
Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 10.06 hereof), a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities.
(f) By delivering the combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, together with a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares to the Conversion Agent or to the Holder or such Holder's nominee or nominees, the Company shall have satisfied in full its Conversion Obligation with respect to such Security, and upon such delivery, accrued and unpaid Interest, if any, and Contingent Interest, if any, with respect to such Security shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited, and such amounts shall no longer accrue.
(g) If a Securityholder delivers a Conversion Notice after the Interest Record Date for a payment of Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, such Securityholder must pay to the Company, at the time such Securityholder surrenders Securities for conversion, an amount equal to the Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any, and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Additional Amounts, if any), that has accrued and shall be paid on the related Interest Payment Date.

(2) the Closing Price of the Common Stock for such day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect to pay cash to the Holders of the Securities surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares issuable upon conversion of such Securities. If the Company elects to pay cash for all or a portion of the Residual Value Shares in lieu of delivery of the Common Stock, it shall inform the Holders who have surrendered their Securities for conversion through the Trustee of the dollar amount to be satisfied in cash (expressed as a percentage of each Residual Value Share that will be paid in cash in lieu of shares of the Common Stock) at any time on or before the date that is three (3) Business Days following the Conversion Date (""), unless the Company has already informed the Holders of its election in connection with an optional redemption of the Securities under Section 3.01.

circumstances where conversions occur within 20 days prior to the Stated Maturity or a specified Redemption Date, in which case the Conversion Reference Period will be the 20 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the fifth Trading Day following the Stated Maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be.
(b) If a Holder tenders Securities for conversion and the Conversion Value is being determined at a time when the Securities are convertible into Exchange Property, the Conversion Value of each Security shall be determined based on the kind and amount of such Exchange Property and the value thereof during the Conversion Reference Period. Settlement of Securities tendered for conversion after the effective date of any transaction giving rise to Exchange Property shall be as set forth above.
For the purposes of this Section, the Closing Price of the Common Stock shall be deemed to equal the sum of (A) 100% of the value of any Exchange Property consisting of cash received per share of Common Stock, (B) the Closing Price of any Exchange Property received per share of Common Stock consisting of securities that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market and (3) the Fair Market Value of any other Exchange Property received per share, as determined by three independent nationally recognized investment banks selected by the Company for this purpose. Settlement (in cash and/or shares) will occur on the third Business Day following the final day of any Conversion Reference Period.
Section 10.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time, without duplication, by the Company in accordance with this Section 10.04:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
(a) In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution by a fraction,
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting the dividend or distribution; and
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination,
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.04 is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(b) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment or share repurchase plans) to all holders of its outstanding shares of
 
Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of such distribution) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day prior to the date upon which such distribution was publicly announced, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options by a fraction,
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options plus (B) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and
(ii) the denominator of which is the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options plus (B) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such date.
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or options are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or options, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights, warrants or options are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, warrants or options and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
(d) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 10.04(b) and excluding any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 10.04(a)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 10.04(d) called the ""), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
Distributed Assets
(i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date; and
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock,
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; , , that in the event (1) the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date or (2) the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Record Date exceeds the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock by less than $1.00, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Assets such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Security on the Record Date for such distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.04(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock.

If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights, warrants or options distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, warrants or options become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the
Trigger Event
 
date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights, warrants or options with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, warrants or options without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, warrants or options, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, warrants or options that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, warrants or options (assuming such holder had retained such rights, warrants or options), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, warrants or options that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
No adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 10.04(d) in respect of rights, warrants or options distributed or deemed distributed on any Trigger Event to the extent that such rights, warrants or options are actually distributed, or reserved by the Company for distribution to Holders of Securities upon conversion by such Holders of Securities to Common Stock.
For purposes of this Section 10.04(d) and Section 10.04(a) and (b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.04(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, warrants or options (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 10.04(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, warrants or options (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.04(a) and (b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except:
(A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 10.04(a) and (b), and
(B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 10.04(a).
If any Distributed Assets requiring any adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.04(d) consists of the Capital Stock, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of
 
the Company which are or in connection with such distribution will be listed or quoted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the Record Date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution shall instead be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate then in effect by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the number of distributed securities so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Closing Prices of those distributed securities for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date on the New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted plus (2) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the same Trading Day period and (B) the denominator of which is such average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date on the New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the securities are then listed or quoted.
(e) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to a all holders of its Common Stock cash (an "") (excluding (i) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or (ii) any quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of the Common Stock in any fiscal quarter does not exceed $0.125 (such amount being the ""); the Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportionate to adjustments to the Conversion Rate (other than for adjustments due to cash dividends)), then, in such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such Extraordinary Cash Dividend by a fraction,
Extraordinary Cash Dividend
Dividend Threshold Amount
(i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date, and
(ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) such Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus (B) the amount per share of such dividend or the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock minus the Dividend Threshold Amount; if an adjustment is required to be made as a result of a cash distribution that is not a regular quarterly dividend, the Dividend Threshold Amount will be deemed to be zero,
such adjustment to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; , that in the event the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Security on such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
provided, however
 
(f) In case a tender or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the "") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction,
Expiration Time
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time, and
Purchased Shares
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time,
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
(g) In case of a tender or exchange offer made by a Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership of Common Stock to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Common Stock outstanding and shall involve the payment by such Person of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the "") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Offer Expiration Time, and in which, as of the Offer Expiration Time the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Offer Expiration Time by a fraction,
Offer Expiration Time
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Offer Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Accepted Purchased Shares) at the Offer Expiration Time and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Offer Expiration Time, and
Accepted Purchased Shares
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Accepted Purchase Shares) at the Offer Expiration Time multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Offer Expiration Time,
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Offer Expiration Time. In the event that such Person is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 10.04(g) shall not be made if, as of the Offer Expiration Time, the offering documents with respect to such offer disclose a plan or intention to cause the Company to engage in any transaction described in Section 10.05.
(h) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 10.04, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any U.S. federal income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock (or rights to acquire Capital Stock) or any event treated as such for income tax purposes; , however, that such increase in the Conversion Rate shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account U.S. federal income tax and other consequences of such increase).
provided
To the extent permitted by applicable law and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it shall be in effect.
(i) All calculations under this Article 10 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth of a share, as the case may be, with one half-cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. No adjustment to the
 
Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment requires an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Rate. However, any adjustments which are not required to be made because they would have required an increase or decrease of less than 1.0% shall be carried forward and be made on the first to occur of (i) any subsequent adjustment, (ii) the first day of the next calendar year and (iii) upon any conversion of the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment need be made for:
(i) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan,
(ii) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Securities were first issued,
(iv) a change in the par value of the Common Stock, or
(v) accrued and unpaid Interest, including Contingent Interest or Additional Amounts, if any.
To the extent the Securities become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than Capital Stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities.
(j) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(k) In any case in which this Section 10.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 10.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights, warrants or options pursuant to Section 10.04(b), (4) the effective date of any subdivision or
 
combination of Common Stock, (5) the Expiration Time for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.04(f), or (6) the Offer Expiration Time for a tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.04(g) (each a ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the relevant Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the Holder of any Security converted after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 10.04(a). For purposes of this Section 10.04(k), the term "" shall mean:
Determination Date
Adjustment Event
(i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
(iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights, warrants or options,
(iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date of such subdivision or combination, and
(v) in any case referred to in clause (5) or clause (6) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
(l) For purposes of this Section 10.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
Section 10.05. . (a) If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination to which Section 10.04(c) applies or a change in par value), (ii) any consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive Exchange Property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case, as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive Exchange Property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
 
adjustments provided for in this Article 10. If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, the Exchange Property receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
(b) The Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities converted following the effective date of any such transaction, shall be calculated (as provided in clause (c) below) based on the Exchange Property. In the event holders of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Company shall make adequate provision whereby the Holders of the Securities shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration, consistent with election rights and restrictions applicable to holders of Common Stock, into which all of the Securities, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the effective date of such transaction (subject to the Company's ability to settle the conversion obligation, entirely in cash as set forth in Section 10.03). Such determination shall be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of the Common Stock are subject, such as pro-rata reductions applicable to any portion of the considerable payable in such event and shall be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the latest of (a) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of the Common Stock in connection with such transaction, and (b) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of such event. The Company shall provide notice of the opportunity to determine the form of such consideration, as well as notice of the determination made by Holders of the Securities by issuing a press release and providing a copy of such notice to the Trustee. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing. However, if the transaction described above also constitutes a Public Acquirer Change of Control, then the Company may in certain circumstances elect to change the conversion right in the manner described in Section 10.01(c) in lieu of changing the conversion right in the manner described in this Section 10.05(b).
(c) The Conversion Obligation in respect of any Securities converted following the effective date of any such transaction shall be computed in the same manner as set forth in Section 10.03(a) and, if the Securities become convertible into Exchange Property, Section 10.03(b), that any amount of the Conversion Settlement Distribution to be delivered in shares of Common Stock shall be paid in Exchange Property rather than shares of Common Stock. If the Exchange Property includes more than one kind of property, the amount of Exchange Property of each kind to be delivered shall be in the proportion that the value of the Exchange Property (as calculated pursuant to Section 10.03) of such kind bears to the value of all such Exchange Property. If the foregoing calculations would require the Company to deliver a fractional share or unit of Exchange Property to a Holder of Securities being converted, the Company shall deliver cash in lieu of such fractional share or unit based on the value of the Exchange Property.
provided,
 
(d) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder of Securities, at its address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(e) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, binding share exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this Section 10.05 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 10.04 shall not apply.
Section 10.06. . The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof, except for applicable withholding, if any. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Securities converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Shares Issued
Section 10.07. . (a) The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion.
Reservation of Shares, Shares to Be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock
(b) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company shall take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
(c) (i) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities shall upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
(ii) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company shall in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
 
Section 10.08. . The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 10. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 10.05 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Securities after any event referred to in such Section 10.05 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in conclusively relying upon the Officer's Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
Responsibility of Trustee
Section 10.09. . In case:
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.04; or
(b) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all of its Common Stock of rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights, warrants or options that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.04(b); or
(c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation, merger or binding share exchange to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities at his address appearing on the register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture,
 
as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution of rights, warrants or options, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the Holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
Section 10.10. . To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Securities into Common Stock, a Holder who converts securities shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all Holders of Common Stock, shares of the Company's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 10.04(d) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend such applicable shareholder rights agreement to provide that upon conversion of the Securities the Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights which would have attached to such Common Stock if the rights had not become separated from the Common Stock under such applicable shareholder rights agreement.
Shareholder Rights Plan
Section 10.11. . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to convert its Security in accordance with this Article 10 and to bring an action for the enforcement of any such right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder; , however, that the right of any Holder to receive cash upon conversion of any Security shall be subject to the subordination provisions of Article 11.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Convert
provided
Section 11.01. . The Company covenants and agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article 11; and each Person holding any Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.
Agreement to Subordinate
The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, Interest, Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all Securities (including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price
 
with respect to the Securities called for redemption or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or the Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities subject to repurchase in accordance with Article 3 as provided in this Indenture) issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred, in full in cash or payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
No provision of this Article 11 shall prevent the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder.
Section 11.02. . No payment shall be made with respect to the principal of, or premium, if any, Interest, Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Securities (including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price with respect to the Securities called for redemption or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or the Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities subject to repurchase in accordance with Article 3 as provided in this Indenture), and no redemption, repurchase or retirement of the Securities shall occur and no deposit shall be made pursuant to Article 8 at a time when such deposited amounts would otherwise be permitted under this Article 11, other than through the delivery of Common Stock (but not the cash portion of the Company's conversion obligation) in respect of the conversion of Securities if:
Payment to Securityholders
(a) a default in the payment of principal, premium, interest, rent or other obligations due on any Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing (or, in the case of Senior Indebtedness for which there is a period of grace, in the event of such a default that continues beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument or lease evidencing such Senior Indebtedness), unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived by the appropriate holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall have ceased to exist; or
(b) a default, other than a payment default, on any Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of all or any portion of such Designated Senior Indebtedness (or would permit such holders to so accelerate with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both) and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "") from a Representative or holder of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Company.
Payment Blockage Notice
Subject to the provisions of Section 11.05, if the Trustee receives any Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to clause (b) above, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until at least 360 days shall have elapsed since the initial effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee (unless such default was waived, cured or otherwise ceased to exist and thereafter subsequently reoccurred) shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days.
 
Unless this Article 11 otherwise prohibits payments on or distributions in respect of the Securities at the time of such payments or distributions, the Company may and shall resume such payments on and distributions:

The Securities shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof at a rate of 3.375% per year. The Company shall pay Contingent Interest, if any, as set forth in the Indenture and in Section 3 hereof. The Company shall also pay Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in Section 4.07 of the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement.
Interest shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to Holders at the close of business on the preceding Interest Record Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall pay Interest to the Securityholder of record on the Interest Record Date even if the Company elects to redeem or Securityholders elect to require the Company to repurchase, the Securities on a date that is after an Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In that instance, the Company shall pay accrued and unpaid Interest on the Securities being redeemed to, but not including, the Redemption Date, the Repurchase Date or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, to the Securityholder of record on the Interest Record Date.
If the principal amount of any Security, or any accrued and unpaid Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any, are not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to Section 5 hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price pursuant to Section 6 hereof, upon the Stated Maturity of the Securities, upon the Interest Payment Dates or upon the Additional Amounts Payment Dates (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear cash interest at the rate of 3.375% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable in cash on demand but if not so demanded shall be paid quarterly to the Holders on the last day of each quarter.
 
Except as provided below, the Company shall pay Interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on (i) Global Securities, to DTC, or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof, in immediately available funds, (ii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 or less, by check mailed to the Holder of such Security and (iii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount of more than $2,000,000, by wire transfer in immediately available funds if requested by the Holder of any such Security as least five business days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.
At Stated Maturity, the Company shall pay Interest on Certificated Securities at the Company's office or agency maintained for that purpose, which initially shall be the office or agency of the Trustee located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall make payments in cash in respect of Redemption Prices, Repurchase Prices, Fundamental Change Repurchase Prices and at Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company shall pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money.
 
The Company shall pay Contingent Interest under the circumstances and in the amounts described in Article 12 of the Indenture. Such Contingent Interest, if any, shall be payable in the same manner, at the same time, and subject to the same restrictions, including those restrictions in respect of accrued and unpaid interest on any Securities that are submitted for conversion, as payments of Interest.
 
The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The Indenture does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Securities are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on or after March 20, 2014 upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail for a redemption price (the "") equal to the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
Redemption Price
 
In no event shall any Security be redeemable before March 20, 2014.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase, at the option of the Holder, all or any portion of the Securities held by such Holder on March 15, 2014, March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022 in integral multiples of $1,000 at a Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Repurchase Date. To exercise such right, a Holder shall deliver to the Paying Agent a Repurchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to such Repurchase Date until the close of business on the Repurchase Date, and shall deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture.
At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the Securities held by such Holder after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change for a Fundamental Change Repurchase Price equal to the principal amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on those Securities up to, but not including, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date.
Holders have the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
If cash sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be, of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Repurchase Date or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent, Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) on and following such Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price upon surrender of such Security.
 
Notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5 of this Security shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, immediately on and after such Redemption Date Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.
 
Subject to the occurrence of certain events and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the conditions to conversion of this Security set forth in Section 10.01 thereof), a Holder is entitled, at such Holder's option, to convert the Holder's Security (or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000), into cash or a combination of cash and fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of conversion.
The Company shall notify Holders of any event triggering the right to convert the Securities as specified in the Indenture.
A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security, may be converted only if such Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
The initial Conversion Rate is 34.8646 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any or accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any. Upon conversion, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any; that if a Conversion Date with respect to any Security occurs between an Interest Record Date for the payment of Interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, Interest, Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, will be paid to the Holder of record of such Security on such Interest Record Date. Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, delivered upon conversion of any Security. A Holder shall receive, however, accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock, except as set forth in the Indenture.
provided
In addition, following certain corporate transactions as set forth in Section 10.01(b) of the Indenture that occur prior to March 20, 2014 and that also constitute a Change of Control, a Holder who elects to convert its Securities in connection with such corporate transaction shall be entitled to receive Additional Shares of Common Stock upon conversion. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may, in lieu of increasing the Conversion Rate by Additional Shares, elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and Conversion Obligation such that from and after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to convert their Securities into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock, as determined pursuant to Section 10.01(d) of the Indenture.
To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the Conversion Notice attached hereto (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the
 
Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (4) if required by Section 10.02(g) of the Indenture, pay Interest and Contingent Interest and (5) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Security, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture.
In the event that the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock, (iii) sells or conveys all or substantially all of its property or assets to any Person, and as a result of any such event the Holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive Exchange Property for their Common Stock, upon conversion of the Securities after the effective date of such event, the Conversion Obligation and the Conversion Settlement Distribution shall be based on the applicable Conversion Rate and the Exchange Property, in each case in accordance with the Indenture.
 
To the extent provided in the Indenture, the Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness, as defined in the Indenture, of the Company. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness must be paid before the Securities may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorizes the Trustee to give it effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
 
Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar.
 
The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed or any Securities in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased).
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes.
 
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable abandoned property law. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.
 
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities and (ii) certain Events of Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities (i) to add guarantees with respect to the Securities or secure the Securities, (ii) to remove any guarantee added to the Securities pursuant to clause (i), unless such guarantee is required pursuant to Section 5.01(a) of the Indenture, (iii) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the Company's obligations to the Holders of Securities in the case of a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease or other disposition pursuant to Article 5 of the Indenture, (iv) to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company in the Indenture, (v) to add to the covenants or Events of Default of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of Securities, (vi) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture which may be inconsistent with any other provision in the Indenture or which is otherwise defective; , , that any such change or modification does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect, (vii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, (viii) to establish the form of Securities if issued in definitive form, (ix) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee, (x) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of Certificated Securities; , , that uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code, (xi) to conform as necessary, the Indenture and this Security to the "Description of Notes" as set forth in the Offering Memorandum, (xii) to provide for conversion rights of Holders of Securities if any reclassification or change of the Company's Common Stock or any consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets occurs, (xiii) to change the Conversion Rate in accordance with the Indenture; , however, that any increase in the Conversion Rate other than pursuant to Article 10 shall not adversely affect the

interests of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account U.S. federal income tax and other consequences of such increase), (xiv) to make any changes or modifications necessary in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement; , however, that any such change or modification does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect and (xv) to add or modify any other provisions of the Indenture with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture which the Company and the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and which, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, which change individually or in the aggregate with all other such changes, shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect.
provided
 
If any Event of Default with respect to Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Interest, accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
The Company or its agents shall be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Securities including, but not limited to, determination of the market prices for the Securities and of the Common Stock and the amounts of Interest, Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, accrued on the Securities. The Company shall make all calculations in good faith. Any calculations made in good faith and without manifest error shall be final and binding on Holders of the Securities. The Company or its agents shall be required to deliver to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a schedule of its calculations and each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without independent verification. The Trustee will forward such calculations to any Holder upon the request of such Holder.

(iv) Advise the selling Holders and any Initial Purchaser that has provided in writing to the Company a telephone or facsimile number and address for notices, promptly and, if requested by such selling Holders, to confirm such advice in writing (which notice pursuant to clauses (B) through (E) below shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the Company shall have remedied the basis for such suspension):

(B) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses or for additional information relating thereto,

(xxi) In connection with any underwritten offering conducted pursuant to Section 8, hereof, obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business
 
acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Shelf Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings.
(xxii) In connection with any underwritten offering conducted pursuant to Section 8 hereof, deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority of Holders and the Managing Underwriters, including those to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement or other agreement entered into by the Company.

(c) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of any notice (a "") from the
Suspension Notice
 
Company of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iv)(B) through (E) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until:
(i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or applicable Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(b)(xi) hereof; or
(ii) such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus and any applicable Issuer Free Writing Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus.
If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that was current at the time of receipt of such notice of suspension.
(d) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security, that no Holder shall be entitled to sell any of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement; or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto, unless such Holder has furnished the Company with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant to Section 2(f) hereof (including the information required to be included in such Notice and Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence. The Company may require each Notice Holder of Notes to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such Notes as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in such Registration Statement. Each Notice Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Notice Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such Notice Holder and the distribution of such Transfer Restricted Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Any sale of any Transfer Restricted Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and warranty by such Holder that the information relating to such Holder and its plan of distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by such Holder in connection with such disposition, that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution and that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale omit to state any material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution necessary to make the statements in such
 
Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. The Company may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Notes of any Holder that unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
 
All expenses incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement shall be borne by the Company regardless of whether a Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation:
(a) all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings made with the NASD);
(b) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities laws;
(c) all expenses of printing (including printing of Prospectuses, Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses and certificates for the Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Notes) and the Company's expenses for messenger and delivery services and telephone;
(d) all fees and disbursements of counsel to the Company;
(e) all application and filing fees in connection with listing (or authorizing for quotation) the Common Stock on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and
(f) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company.
The Company shall bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of their officers and employees performing legal, accounting or other duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company. The Company shall pay all expenses customarily borne by issuers in an underwritten offering as set forth in Section 8(c) hereof.
 
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (including each Initial Purchaser), its directors, officers, and employees, Affiliates and agents and each person, if any, who controls any such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an ""), against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim,
Indemnified Holder
 
damage, liability or action relating to resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities), to which such Indemnified Holder may become subject, insofar as any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, in any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any blue sky application or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto prepared or executed by the Company (or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company expressly for use in such blue sky application or other document or amendment or supplement) filed in any jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities law of any state or other jurisdiction (such application or document being hereinafter called a ""); or
Blue Sky Application
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Holder promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder (or its related Indemnified Holder) specifically for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however,
The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(e) hereof to Losses (as defined below) of each underwriter, if any, of Notes registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(b)(xxv) hereof.
 
(b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (i) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity and (ii) against any loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action, joint or several, including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action relating to resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities, to which such person may become subject, insofar as any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action arises out of, or is based upon any Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) used by such holder without the prior written consent of the Issuer, and in connection with any underwritten offering, the underwriters, provided that the indemnification obligation in this clause (ii) shall be several, not joint and several, among the Holders who used such Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement set forth in this Section shall be in addition to any liabilities which any such Holder may otherwise have. In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; that the failure to notify the indemnifying party (i) shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) shall not, in any event, relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with
provided, however,
 
counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; that the Holders shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent jointly the Holders and their officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Holders against the Company under this Section 6 if the Holders seeking indemnification shall have been advised by legal counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Holders and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Company, and in that event, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company.
provided, however,
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 6(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or
 
liability (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein, each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "") (or action in respect thereof):
Losses
(i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the one hand and a Holder with respect to the sale by such Holder of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the other, or
(ii) if the allocation provided by Section (6)(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 6(d)(i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and a Holder on the other with respect to such offering and such sale shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, bear to the total proceeds received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities on the other. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Holders on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (e).
pro rata
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 6 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 6, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim.
 
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 6(e) are several and not joint.
(f) The provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive the sale by a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities.
7. The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to use its reasonable best efforts to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
Rule 144A and Rule 144.
 
(a) Any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities who desires to do so may sell Transfer Restricted Securities (in whole or in part) in an underwritten offering; provided that (i) the electing Holders of at least 33-1/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities then covered by the Shelf Registration Statement shall request such an offering, (ii) at least such aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be included in such offering; and provided further that the Company shall not be obligated to participate in more than one underwritten offering during the Effectiveness Period and (iii) such Holder does not object to any other Holder including its Transfer Restricted Securities (in whole or in part) in such offering. Upon receipt of such a request, the Company shall provide all Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities written notice of the request, which notice shall inform such Holders that they have the opportunity to participate in the offering. If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority of Holders.
(b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Notes on the basis reasonably provided in any
 
underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; and (iii) if such Holder is not then a Notice Holder, such Holder returns a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 2(f) hereof within a reasonable amount of time before such underwritten offering.
(c) The Holders participating in any underwritten offering shall be responsible for any underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and, subject to Section 5 hereof, expenses of their own counsel. The Company shall pay all expenses customarily borne by issuers in an underwritten offering, including but not limited to filing fees, the fees and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants and any printing expenses incurred in connection with such underwritten offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of Section 4(b)(xxiii) hereof, upon receipt of a request from the Managing Underwriter or a representative of holders of a majority of the Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in an underwritten offering to prepare and file an amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus in connection with an underwritten offering, the Company may delay the filing of any such amendment or supplement for up to 90 days if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith that the Company has a bona fide business reason for such delay.
 
(a) Each Holder represents that it has not prepared or had prepared on its behalf or used or referred to, and agrees that it will not prepare or have prepared on its behalf or use or refer to, any Free Writing Prospectuses, and has not distributed and will not distribute any written materials in connection with the offer or sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities without the prior express written consent of the Company and, in connection with any underwritten offering, the underwriters. Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Company and, if applicable, the underwriters, as the case may be, is hereinafter referred to as a "." The Company represents and agrees that it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and recordkeeping.

- Net sales rise 20 percent to a record $361 million
- Net income rises 50 percent; diluted EPS of $0.50, up 39 percent
- Full-year 2007 estimated net income per diluted share raised to $1.74 - $1.83
Bristol, Connecticut, May 9, 2007---
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Net sales for the first quarter were $360.7 million, up 20 percent from $299.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating income grew 54 percent to $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2007, from $28.1 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Net income increased 50 percent to $27.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $18.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Barnes Groups first quarter results included double-digit top line growth, with sales in excess of $360 million and corresponding increases in operating income and net income, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. The continued consistent performance of Barnes Group, with 17 quarters of double-digit sales growth, combined with the momentum of our operational improvement initiatives provide us with greater confidence in our outlook for 2007.
First quarter performance exceeded our expectations with strong revenue growth and improved profitability. We are increasing our full-year estimate of diluted earnings per share to $1.74 - $1.83, from the previous estimate of $1.53 - $1.60, based on current market conditions, said William C. Denninger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $91.2 million in the first quarter 2007, up 36 percent from $66.9 million in the same period a year ago as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales increased by 26 percent and aftermarket sales increased by 63 percent.
Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $103.7 million in the first quarter, up 43 percent from $72.5 million in the first quarter 2006. Commercial orders were $64.0 million and military orders were $10.2 million, up 49 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Order backlog was $415.6 million at the end of the first quarter 2007, up 3 percent from $403.0 million at December 31, 2006.
 
 
 
In the first quarter 2007, operating profit increased 97 percent to $16.8 million, up from $8.5 million in the first quarter 2006. Driving this strong increase in operating profit were higher sales volume and an increased percentage of higher margin aftermarket sales.
Strong growth in the OEM and aftermarket business continues to generate record sales and operating profit for Barnes Aerospace, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace. To capitalize on strong industry fundamentals, we are increasing capacity to meet customer demand through on-going operational efficiencies and strategic capital investments.
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $152.5 million in the first quarter 2007, up 23 percent from $124.4 million in the same quarter a year ago, as a result of $22.7 million of incremental sales from the KENT acquisition and organic sales growth of $3.7 million. Organic sales grew in large part as a result of price increases and continued growth in Corporate and Tier II accounts. Foreign exchange positively affected sales by $1.7 million in the first quarter 2007.
Operating profit in the first quarter 2007 increased 14 percent to $10.2 million, up from $9.0 million in the first quarter 2006. Higher operating profit reflects higher sales and the profit contribution from the July 2006 acquisition of KENT. However, operating margins decreased in the first quarter 2007 as compared to first quarter 2006 primarily due to lower margins at KENT, which included approximately $0.7 million of integration costs. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, Barnes Distributions operating profit reflected a shift in the business mix to lower margin customers, an increase in field compensation as a result of an investment in a larger fixed cost sales force, and higher supplier costs and freight costs. These costs were largely offset through higher selling prices.
Barnes Distribution continues its focus on sales growth and operational improvements, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution. Our pace of improvement needs to accelerate and our operational initiatives are focused on enhancing profit levels while maintaining our commitment to superior customer service. To accomplish this, we have initiated Project Catalyst with the goal of achieving 10 percent or better operating margins next year.
Sales at Barnes Industrial, formerly Associated Spring, were $119.6 million in the first quarter 2007, up 8 percent from $111.0 million in the first quarter 2006. Included in this sales increase were $8.6 million from the May 2006 acquisition of Heinz Hnggi GmbH and a $2.4 million favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Operating profit in the first quarter 2007 increased 52 percent to $16.2 million, up from $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. The higher operating profit was driven primarily by the Heinz Hnggi acquisition and continued operational improvements, primarily in the Engineered Springs business.
Barnes Industrials first quarter results reflect the continued benefits of operational improvements throughout its global facilities, said Jerry W. Burris, President, Barnes Industrial. The redefinition of our business segment and our profit-centric focus provide the strategic framework for our continued success.
Barnes Group will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss first quarter results at 2:00 p.m. EDT today, May 9, 2007. A web cast of the live call, supporting materials and an archived replay will be available on the Barnes Group investor relations link at

Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE:B) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.  Net sales for the second quarter were $359.5 million, up 16 percent from $308.9 million in the second quarter of 2006.  Operating income increased 40 percent to $40.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, from $28.7 million in the second quarter of the prior year.  Operating margin increased 1.9 percentage points in the second quarter 2007 to 11.2 percent, from 9.3 percent in the second quarter 2006.  Net income grew 58 percent to $28.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $18.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share in the second quarter in the prior year.
Bristol, Connecticut, August 2, 2007---
Barnes Group continued its sound performance, achieving 16 percent revenue growth, the 18 quarter of double-digit sales increases, and strong increases in operating profit and net income for the quarter, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  Each of our businesses continues to implement operational improvements to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
th
Sales at Barnes Aerospace were $92.4 million in the second quarter 2007, up 25 percent from $73.9 million in the second quarter 2006 as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales of $62.3 million grew 21 percent and aftermarket sales of $30.1 million were up 36 percent.
Barnes Aerospace generated orders of $116.1 million in the second quarter of 2007, down from a record $124.6 million in the year ago quarter.  Commercial orders were $69.4 million and military orders were $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2007.  At the end of the second quarter 2007, order backlog was a record $439.5 million, up 6 percent from $415.6 million at March 31, 2007.

profit were the higher sales volume and an increased percentage in higher margin aftermarket activity.
Barnes Aerospace continues to leverage strong end markets in both the OEM and aftermarket businesses leading to record results in the second quarter of 2007, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President, Barnes Aerospace.  By using the latest techniques in operational excellence, Barnes Aerospace continues to deliver high-quality components and value-added services that meet the needs of the global aerospace industry.
Sales at Barnes Distribution were $150.7 million in the second quarter of 2007, up 20 percent from $125.5 million in the second quarter of 2006, including $22.2 million of incremental sales from the KENT acquisition and organic sales growth of $1.3 million.  The modest increase in organic sales is primarily a result of Corporate and Tier II account sales increases of 10 percent and 24 percent, respectively.  Foreign exchange positively affected sales by $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Operating income at Barnes Distribution was $7.5 million in the second quarter, down 16 percent from $8.9 million in the year-ago quarter.  Negatively impacting operating profit were pre-tax costs of approximately $2.0 million associated with Project Catalyst.  Additionally, operating profit was negatively impacted by higher product and freight costs, business mix, and incremental bad debt expense as compared to the 2006 period.  These costs were partially offset by improved pricing and lower incentive compensation as compared to the 2006 period.
In the second quarter, Barnes Distribution began implementing the initiatives of Project Catalyst by focusing on international sourcing, network efficiencies, sales and marketing resources and continued KENT integration, said Idelle K. Wolf, President, Barnes Distribution.  The actions that we are currently undertaking will accelerate improvements in Barnes Distributions operations, including sales growth and profitability, and position us for success in 2008.
Sales at Barnes Industrial were $118.7 million in the second quarter 2007, up 6 percent from $112.1 million in the same quarter last year.  The Heinz Hnggi acquisition from last year contributed $4.2 million of incremental sales in the second quarter and foreign currency exchange favorably impacted sales by $2.6 million.  Improved end markets within Barnes Industrials specialty operations are generating strong orders and backlog, over the prior year.
Operating profit at Barnes Industrial increased 55 percent to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $9.2 million in the second quarter 2006.  Driving this improvement were the profit contribution from Heinz Hnggi sales and higher profits from operational improvements, primarily in the specialty businesses.
 
"Our second quarter results demonstrate the continued benefits of
operational improvements throughout Barnes Industrial," said Jerry
Burris, President, Barnes Industrial.  "Barnes Industrial remains
focused  on profitable sales growth and strengthening performance
worldwide."
William C. Denninger, Barnes Group Inc.s Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, commented, For each of our business segments, the second quarter was another financially solid quarter with strong contributions to the balance sheet and cash flow.
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
 
In the third quarter of 2007, the Company is realigning its Raymond division, the stock spring catalog and custom solutions business with approximately $50 million in revenues during 2006.  This business currently resides within Barnes Distribution and will be transferred to Barnes Industrial.  The transfer of the stock spring catalog and custom solutions business strengthens its relationship with Barnes Industrials global sales channels and manufacturing of engineered spring components.  With greater focus on leveraging common synergies and integrating business activities and results, Barnes Industrial will maximize their strategic initiatives and Barnes Distribution will enhance their focus on their Vendor Managed Inventory supply chain solution, said Denninger.
For the first six months of 2007, Barnes Group net sales were $720.2 million, up 18 percent from $608.8 million in the same six months a year ago.  Net income increased 54 percent to $56.0 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2007, from $36.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the same period in 2006.

On September 19, 2007, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") entered into a fourth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") with certain participating banks and financial institutions. Bank of America, N.A. continues to act as Administrative Agent for the lenders. The Amended Credit Agreement extends the maturity date to September 19, 2012 (with the option to extend such maturity date for an additional two years, subject to certain conditions); increases the borrowing availability of Barnes Group Switzerland GmbH ("Swiss Co." and together with the Company, the "Borrowers") to 100%; decreases the interest rate to LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.30% to 1.15%, depending on the Company's debt ratio at the time of the borrowing; and amends various financial and restrictive covenants, described in more detail below. Borrowings by Swiss Co. continue to be guaranteed by the Company. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is to pay a facility fee, calculated on the full amount of the borrowing facility, at a rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.35%, depending on the Company's debt ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter.
As with the prior revolving credit agreement the Borrowers' borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement.

NEWS RELEASE
 
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and distributor, today reported third quarter 2007 net income growth of 46.7 percent to $27.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to the prior-year quarter.  Third quarter results were driven by strong Aerospace performance with record sales, operating profit, and backlog, as well as continued strength in Barnes Industrial.  The increase in net income reflects 11.9 percent revenue growth driven by strong Aerospace demand and continued success in the aerospace aftermarket business.  Operating income improved 31.2 percent over the prior-year quarter as a result of the profit contribution from higher sales volume within Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Industrial as well as continued company wide efforts focused on operational enhancements.  Operating margin increased 1.6 percentage points in the third quarter 2007 to 11.1 percent.
Bristol, Connecticut, November 2, 2007---
Barnes Group continued its solid performance by achieving its 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth while posting strong increases in operating profit and net income for the third quarter of 2007, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  To further our success, our focus is on execution, growth, and productivity.  We will continue to take on challenges directly, such as key initiatives within Barnes Distribution, to improve our long-term operating and financial performance and to realize the Companys full potential.
Barnes Group generated strong revenue growth and improved profitability in the first three quarters of 2007.  We continue to demonstrate a consistent pattern of growth in earnings and earnings per share over the prior year.  As we look toward the end of the year, based on the strength of the Aerospace and Industrial businesses and on current conditions, we are refining our full-year estimate of diluted earnings per share to $1.79 - $1.83, or 30 percent growth over 2006 and at the top-end of our previous estimate of $1.74 - $1.83, said William C. Denninger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
We continue to consider opportunities to enhance and improve our operating performance across all of our businesses.  In connection with this we are considering product rationalization and realignment activities within Barnes Industrial.  The potential 2007 charges associated with these actions are currently estimated at approximately $2.5 million to $3.0 million, on an after-tax basis, and are not included in our full-year diluted earnings per share estimate.  The actions we are considering would be expected to provide improvements to 2008 results.
Barnes Group, Inc. / 2
 
"In addition, not included in the 2007 full-year estimate is a one-time charge, not to exceed $3.3 million on income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of a recently-enacted change to tax laws in Mexico," continued Denninger.
 
As previously reported, during the third quarter, the Company realigned its reportable business segments by transferring the stock spring catalog and custom solutions business, from Barnes Distribution to Barnes Industrial, whose Engineered Springs business manufactures many of the spring products sold by this business.  Segment information has been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect this change.
Barnes Aerospace
 
 
Barnes Aerospace generated outstanding results with record sales, operating profit, and backlog in the third quarter of 2007 by leveraging strong end markets in both the manufacturing, or original equipment, and aftermarket businesses.  Key productivity measures such as sales per employee and operating profit per employee were up 24 percent and 70 percent, respectively.  Barnes Aerospace continues to embrace Lean and implement successful Lean initiatives throughout its worldwide operations.
Barnes Aerospace achieved record sales of $103.2 million in the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 33.6 percent over the third quarter of 2006.  The third quarter 2007 sales increase reflects growth of 36.3 percent in aftermarket sales.  Aftermarket sales during the quarter continue to be driven by aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs), which grew 88.5 percent in the quarter to $15.5 million, reflecting the positive impact of additional programs since the third quarter 2006.  Also contributing to aftermarket sales growth were strong industry fundamentals and continued benefits from strategic maintenance and repair contracts, which increased Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) sales 11.2 percent to $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2007.  The MRO sales growth during the quarter was, and is expected to remain, above industry averages due to Barnes Aerospaces focus on service, delivery, and quality.
Manufacturing sales increased 32.4 percent for the quarter on the strength of the manufacturing backlog.  The total order backlog at Barnes Aerospace at the end of the third quarter of 2007 was
 
Barnes Group, Inc. / 3
 
$469.9 million, up from $403.0 million at December 31, 2006.  Approximately 60 percent of the backlog at September 30, 2007 is expected to be shipped within the next 12 months.
Barnes Aerospaces third quarter 2007 operating profit was $20.7 million, an increase of 82.6 percent from the 2006 period.  Barnes Aerospace has generated quarter-over-quarter growth in operating profit for 15 consecutive quarters.  Operating profit was positively impacted by the profit contribution from the highly profitable aftermarket RSPs as well as the higher sales volume increases in both the overhaul and repair and manufacturing businesses.
During the third quarter, Barnes Aerospace broke ground in Ogden, Utah on the construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for producing precision aerospace components for use in a wide range of aircraft engine and airframe applications, particularly the GEnx and Trent 1000 engines.  Specializing in complex assembly, welding, vacuum furnace brazing, hot, cold, and superplastic forming, multi-axis milling, laser, and waterjet cutting technologies, the Ogden manufacturing facility will be a prime source for complex fabrication of high-temperature metals including titanium, hasteloy, inconel and stainless steels.  This new facility will enhance Barnes Aerospaces ability to meet customer needs by employing the latest techniques in operational excellence, the cornerstone of Barnes Aerospaces success.
The new facility is expected to be operational by the second half of 2008.  Costs related to the expansion during the third quarter were approximately $0.3 million.  Full-year operating profit is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.8 million in 2007, lower than previously estimated due to refinements in estimated lease costs.  Considering Barnes Aerospaces costs associated with capacity expansion, transfer of production, new product introductions, and enterprise wide-investments, the full year 2007 estimated operating margin is projected to be approximately 19%.
Barnes Distribution
 
 
Barnes Distribution continues to invest in its business through Project Catalyst initiatives to accelerate improvement in its operations and build a foundation for profitable growth.  Third quarter results reflect ongoing progress towards positioning the segment for continued growth and financial improvement.
Barnes Distribution achieved sales of $132.0 million in the third quarter of 2007, a 6.6 percent increase over the third quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of $6.8 million of incremental sales from the acquisition of KENT in 2006.  Barnes Distributions organic sales decreased $1.3 million, or approximately 1 percent.  The lower organic sales were due to softness in certain served markets in North America, primarily the construction support and transportation related markets, and as a result of the short-term effects of implementing certain Project Catalyst initiatives.  Partially offsetting this decline is continued market pricing and growth in Corporate and Tier II accounts, which grew 6 percent and 23 percent, respectively.  Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2007 as foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, primarily in Europe and Canada.
Barnes Group, Inc. / 4
 
Barnes Distributions operating profit for the third quarter of 2007 decreased $3.3 million, or 55.5 percent.  The third quarter of 2007 includes costs related to Project Catalyst of approximately $1.5 million.  Additionally, operating profit was negatively impacted by an increase in field compensation as a result of an investment in a larger fixed cost sales force.  These costs were partially offset through market pricing and lower incentive compensation.
The full-year 2007 Barnes Distribution operating margin is projected to be in the 2 to 3 percent range and takes into consideration one-time costs of approximately $7.7 million associated with Project Catalyst, of which $4.4 million has been incurred through the third quarter of 2007.  Project Catalyst costs are projected to be lower than originally anticipated based on the results of the distribution center network review and the related recommended actions.  The results reported this quarter for Barnes Distribution reflect the expected volatility from Project Catalyst.  For 2008, we remain committed to the significant operating profit performance improvement goal of 8 percent.
As previously announced, Patrick Dempsey, Vice President of Barnes Group Inc., and former President of Barnes Aerospace, has taken over responsibilities for Barnes Distribution as the new segment President.  Patrick will continue to strengthen Barnes Distributions efforts in enhancing profit levels and maintaining its commitment to superior customer service while continuing its intense focus on Project Catalyst.
Project Catalyst Update
As previously announced Barnes Distribution initiated Project Catalyst, consisting of four initiatives: Global Product Sourcing, Logistics Network Optimization, Sales & Margin Improvement, and European Market Development.  The goal of Project Catalyst is to service customers as effectively and efficiently as possible by leveraging Barnes Distributions expertise with the Vendor Managed Inventory model, and position the business for sustainable profitable growth.  During the third quarter Barnes Distribution continued to make progress within each of the initiatives.
- The activity within the international sourcing center in Shanghai remains focused on improving the quality and cost of the supplier base.  Progress within this initiative is measured by the actual spend for globally sourced product versus total targeted global spend.  Through the third quarter, Barnes Distribution remains on schedule and has identified new suppliers totaling approximately two-thirds of the 2008 targeted level.
Global Product Sourcing
- Upon completion of the network review, management concluded that the footprint of the U.S. distribution center network is appropriate at this time.  As part of the Canadian operations review it was determined that the optimal structure to pursue business opportunities would be to expand the warehouse in the Edmonton, Alberta area.  The expansion, which will occur during the fourth quarter, will allow Barnes Distribution Canada to maximize opportunities within one of Barnes Distributions targeted vertical markets, Natural Resources.
Logistics & Network Optimization
The implementation of the new Warehouse Management System, or WMS, in the Dallas distribution center continued during the third quarter.  The goal of WMS is to improve the overall efficiency of each distribution center including: receiving, inventory management, planning, fulfillment, and shipping.  To ensure a robust, integrated, and aligned set of best practice tools and processes, which maximize facility efficiency, ongoing testing within the Dallas distribution center will continue throughout the fourth quarter.  As a result, the rollout of WMS to the Chicago and Reno distribution centers are scheduled for the early part of 2008.
Barnes Group, Inc. / 5
 
- During the third quarter a market-focused reorganization of Barnes Distributions core sales management structure was implemented along with customer-facing strategies and tools to drive long-term profitable sales growth.  The sales force integration negatively impacted sales force productivity in the third quarter as roughly 50 percent of the sales force was realigned with a new manager.  Barnes Distribution has not experienced increased sales force turnover as a result of the reorganization, demonstrating the sales management and sales force teams support of the change.
Sales & Margin Improvement
Barnes Distributions new Sales Force Automation (SFA) hand-held electronic device was fully implemented in North America during the third quarter.  The customer focused technology provides greater support and further strengthens relationships with customers.  The SFA device provides the latest technology to the sales force by incorporating real-time access to product information, visibility into inventory levels, and route scheduling capabilities.
Within this initiative, as the organization develops a profit centric focus, the ongoing vertical market focus and disciplined market pricing are essential for profitable growth.
- The KENT integration, which is a critical component of the European Market Development initiative, continues to move forward.  During the third quarter the Horsham, United Kingdom facility which included a number of back office operations was closed.  In addition, activities related to the operations of the newly expanded Flers, France distribution center focused on leveraging the single facility following the consolidation of the Elancourt, France warehouse.
European Market Development
Barnes Industrial
 
Barnes Industrials operational improvement initiatives continue to generate solid financial performance.  Key productivity measures such as sales per employee and operating profit per employee were up 6 percent and 31 percent, respectively.  Barnes Industrial will continue to review opportunities to enhance and improve operating performance including product rationalization and realignment activities.
Sales at Barnes Industrial for the third quarter of 2007 were $125.6 million, a 3.5 percent increase from the third quarter of 2006.  The increase in 2007 resulted primarily from the favorable impact on sales of foreign currency translation of approximately $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 as foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, primarily in Europe.  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2007 Barnes Industrial recorded sales increases in the retention rings and nitrogen gas products businesses as compared to the 2006 period.
The general industrial end markets including tool-and-die and energy performed well during the quarter and were partially offset by the transportation, including North American heavy duty truck, telecom and electronics end markets.  Lower sales within the precision valves business were negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures in the compressor market due to the decline in
 
Barnes Group, Inc. / 6
 
consumer home product sales, coupled with a continued customer shift to low-cost countries and the associated localization of suppliers.
Barnes Industrials third quarter 2007 operating profit was $16.8 million, a 27.1 percent improvement from the comparable 2006 period.  The higher operating profit resulted primarily from increased sales within the retention rings and nitrogen gas products businesses, as well as operational improvements within Engineered Springs and higher profits from the precision forming business.  Additionally, the 2006 period included $0.6 million of reorganization costs related to a plant closure and costs for the transfer of certain production to lower-cost facilities, which did not recur in 2007.
The full-year 2007 operating margin at Barnes Industrial, including continued enterprise wide investments, is expected to be approximately 14 percent, and excludes the impact of potential realignment activities in the fourth quarter.
Total Company
- The Company reported net sales of $360.4 million in the third quarter of 2007, an increase of $38.4 million or 11.9 percent, over the third quarter of 2006; the 19 consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth.  The sales increase reflected $25.4 million of organic sales growth primarily at Barnes Aerospace.  Additionally, acquisition related growth contributed $6.8 million due to the KENT acquisition within Barnes Distribution.  Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately $6.2 million in 2007 as foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, primarily in Europe.
Revenues
th
- Cost of sales increased 11.1 percent in the third quarter of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of higher sales levels.  The increase in cost of sales was slightly lower than the 11.9 percent increase in sales and resulted in a 0.5 percentage point improvement in gross margin, to 37.3 percent.  This improvement in gross profit margin was driven primarily by increased sales in the higher margin aerospace aftermarket RSPs and aerospace manufacturing businesses, and at Barnes Industrial, driven primarily by sales within the higher margin precision forming business, as well as overall higher selling prices and operational efficiencies.  Barnes Distributions gross margin was lower than the prior year, mainly as a result of the costs of activities associated with Project Catalyst.
Cost of Sales and S&A
Selling and administrative expenses increased 7.0 percent in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 26.1 percent in the third quarter of 2007 from 27.3 percent in the same period of 2006.  This decrease was due primarily to increased OEM and aftermarket RSP sales at Barnes Aerospace which have lower selling and administrative expense components, offset in part by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales at Barnes Distribution.
Barnes Group, Inc. / 7
 
- Operating income was $40.1 million in the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 31.2 percent over the same period in 2006.  Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Industrial were the primary contributors to the increase in operating income, partially offset by decreases in Barnes Distribution.  Operating income margin for the quarter improved to 11.1 percent from 9.5 percent a year ago.
Operating income
- Other expenses, net of other income, decreased $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange losses.  Interest expense of $6.2 million decreased $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2007, primarily due to a lower average interest rate driven in large part by the addition of the 3.375 percent convertible notes issued in the first quarter of 2007.
Other Income/Interest Expense
On July 1, 2007 the Companys 3.75 percent convertible senior subordinated notes became eligible for conversion; however, from July 1, 2007 until September 30, 2007, none of the notes were converted.  Following clarification of the accounting for the amortization of deferred fees it was determined that, based on the Companys policy of amortizing deferred debt issuance costs over the stated term of the debt, the acceleration of the amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs of $2.4 million pre-tax was not required.
- The Companys effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2007 was 19.4 percent, which resulted in an effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2007 of 18.3 percent, compared with 21.7 percent in the first nine months of 2006 and 20.8 percent for the full-year of 2006.  Changes in the Companys tax rate are largely dependent on the mix between domestic and international earnings.  The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2006 was primarily driven by lower Barnes Distribution results in North America and additional earnings from the Revenue Sharing Programs in Singapore, a lower-tax jurisdiction.
Income Taxes
As detailed previously, a recently enacted change to tax laws in Mexico is expected to have a one-time adverse impact of no greater than $3.3 million on income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to the adjustment of deferred tax assets.
- Net income for the third quarter was $27.7 million, a 46.7 percent increase over last year and diluted EPS was $0.47, a 34.3 percent increase.  EPS growth was adversely affected by a 9.2 percent increase in diluted shares to 58.4 million, which includes the dilutive effect of the convertible notes.  This dilutive effect was in large part driven by the increase in the Companys stock price.  The anticipated weighted average diluted share count for the full year 2007 is projected to be approximately 58 million.
Net income
- Cash was $22.6 million at the end of the quarter.  The debt to capitalization ratio was 40.3 percent, at the low-end of the Companys targeted range of 40 to 45 percent.  The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.11 times versus a total debt covenant of 4.0 times, and allows for additional borrowings in excess of the currently unused credit line of $306.2 million.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit agreement in September 2007 which, among other things, extended the maturity date of the facility through September 2012, increased the borrowing capacity of Barnes Group Switzerland GmbH, and decreased the interest rate.
Operating activities provided $87.2 million in cash in the nine months of 2007 compared to $69.8 million in the first nine months of 2006.  Compared to the 2006 period, operating cash flows in the 2007 period were positively impacted by improved operating performance.
Barnes Group, Inc. / 8
 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were approximately $10.0 million.  Full-year capital expenditures are projected to be in the $45 to $50 million range and are directed primarily to investments needed to increase capacity and improve operational efficiency.  Depreciation is expected to be around $35 million and the estimated amortization of intangible assets is projected to be around $11 million.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On November 15, 2007, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") approved a restructuring of one of the Barnes Industrial operating facilities. This restructuring is among the actions that were contemplated in the announcement regarding a realignment within Barnes Industrial made by the Company in the Third Quarter 2007 Financial Results press release, dated November 2, 2007. The restructuring includes a reduction-in-force, production realignment and product rationalization.
As a result of this action, the Company expects to incur approximately $3.4 million of after-tax charges, of which $2.0 million is expected to be expensed in 2007. The amount expensed in 2007 relates primarily to employee termination costs. The balance, $1.4 million, will be expensed in 2008 or later and is expected to be offset by related savings. This amount relates to pension settlement costs, relocation costs and equipment transfer costs. $2.0 million of the $3.4 million is expected to result in a cash expenditure.
***
From time to time the Company may take additional right-sizing actions that are not part of the above-described realignment actions.

Exhibit 99.1
Barnes Group Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Results
2007 annual net sales rise 14 percent to $1.44 billion
2007 net income increases 37% with diluted EPS up 27%
Full year 2008 diluted EPS projected to increase 25% to 30%
BRISTOL, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and distributor, today reported fourth quarter 2007 net income of $17.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Net income for the full year 2007 was $101.3 million, an increase of 37 percent, and full year diluted earnings per share of $1.76, a 27 percent increase over 2006. Results were driven by strong Aerospace and Industrial segment performance. Fourth quarter 2007 sales increased 9 percent and for the full year 2007, Barnes Groups net sales were $1.44 billion, up 14 percent from $1.26 billion in 2006.
Included in fourth quarter and full year 2007 reported results are charges of approximately $2.6 million pre-tax, or $2.2 million after-tax, for a reduction-in-force resulting from production realignment and product rationalization at Barnes Industrial, and additional tax expense of $2.4 million due to recent foreign tax law changes. These charges were described in our November 2, 2007 third quarter 2007 earnings press release, though the full amount of the charges was not clearly defined at that time. As the Company detailed, the estimated cost of the reduction-in-force within Barnes Industrial and the additional tax expense were excluded from the 2007 full year guidance, which at the time was $1.79 to $1.83 per diluted share.
Excluding the Barnes Industrial reduction-in-force charge and the additional tax expense, fourth quarter adjusted net income increased 20 percent to $22.2 million compared to the prior-year quarter, and on a comparable basis diluted earnings per share of $0.38 increased 12 percent. Adjusted net income for the full-year 2007 increased 43 percent to $105.9 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, up 32 percent. References to adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted income taxes, and adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 are non-GAAP financial measures which are detailed on the non-GAAP financial reconciliations at the end of this press release.
Barnes Groups results are reaching new heights as we continue to deliver on our commitments. We have demonstrated an ability to succeed in challenging environments by delivering full year reported diluted earnings per share growth of 27%, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. Customer demand remains very strong, particularly in Aerospace and among our European based industrial businesses, and we are making the necessary investments to maximize both our potential in the marketplace and long-term stockholder value. As an organization we remain committed to exceeding customer expectations by ensuring quality and on-time delivery of our products and services. Ongoing investments in our business such as lean enterprise activities and systematic goal deployment will allow us to adapt in an uncertain economic environment and remain focused on achieving our objective of profitable growth, continued Milzcik.
The strength of Barnes Groups global operations provides the platform for ongoing balanced, sustainable, and consistent financial performance, said William C. Denninger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc. We believe the investments we have made within all three of our segments and particularly Project Catalyst within Barnes Distribution, position the Company for another year of improved performance. The Companys targeted earnings for full-year 2008, based on current market conditions, are in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share, which reflects an increase over 2007 reported results of 25 percent to 30 percent.
As previously reported, Barnes Group realigned its reportable business segments during 2007 by transferring the stock spring catalog and custom solutions business from Barnes Distribution to Barnes Industrial, whose engineered springs business manufactures many of the spring products sold by this business. Segment information has been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect this change.
Barnes Aerospace
Barnes Aerospace delivered another strong quarter, culminating a very successful year of significant operational activity. Capacity expansion, transfer of production, new product introductions, and enterprise-wide investments were successfully undertaken in a dynamic industrial setting, including globalization, dollarization, and outsourcing. Barnes Aerospaces momentum is expected to continue, based on new Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs), product expansion within the aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business, and increased production capabilities driven by rigorous lean enterprise activities implemented throughout its worldwide operations. Full year 2007 operating margins were at a record 18.9 percent, a 4.5 point improvement over 2006.
Barnes Aerospace generated sales of $105.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 34 percent over the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter 2007 sales increase reflects growth of 31 percent in aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales during the quarter continued to be driven by RSPs, which grew 68 percent in the quarter to $16.3 million, reflecting the positive impact of additional programs since the fourth quarter 2006 along with increased demand on existing RSPs. Also contributing to aftermarket sales growth were strong industry fundamentals and continued benefits from long-term maintenance and repair contracts, which increased MRO sales 10 percent to $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. MRO activity continued to increase as customers turned to Barnes Aerospace for its industry-recognized reliable, high-quality, global capabilities, and demonstrated track record of meeting customer needs.
Manufacturing sales increased 35 percent for the quarter on the strength of the sales order backlog. The total order backlog at Barnes Aerospace at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 was $472.6 million, up from $403.0 million at December 31, 2006. Approximately 63 percent of the backlog at December 31, 2007 is expected to be shipped within the next 12 months.
Barnes Aerospaces fourth quarter 2007 operating profit was $17.9 million, an increase of 47 percent from the 2006 period. Barnes Aerospace has generated quarter-over-quarter growth in operating profit for 16 consecutive quarters. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 was positively impacted by the profit contribution from the aftermarket RSPs as well as the higher sales volume increases in both the MRO and manufacturing businesses. In addition, each of the businesses continued driving lean initiatives which contributed to the higher productivity and cost savings. This was offset, in part, by increased expenditures in the MRO business to capitalize on the strength of the current and expected future demand within this business and to maintain the highest standards around service, delivery, and quality for our customers. In addition, Barnes Aerospace incurred approximately $0.5 million of expense for the Ogden, Utah facility expansion during the fourth quarter of 2007. Full-year 2007 costs related to the expansion were $0.8 million. The construction of this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility will leverage the growth opportunities for a wide range of aircraft engine and airframe applications, particularly the GEnx and Trent 1000 engines. The new facility is expected to be operational by the second half of 2008.
Barnes Distribution
Barnes Distribution continued to invest in its business through Project Catalyst initiatives to accelerate improvement in its operations and build a foundation for profitable growth. Fourth quarter results reflect ongoing progress towards positioning the segment for growth and financial improvement. Barnes Distribution is a customer service business and is continually focused on partnering with, and adding value for, our customers. With recent organizational changes, a strong management team, clear objectives, the right sales technology, and a top-tier sales force Barnes Distribution is positioned to achieve the profitability and sales goals set forth for 2008.
Barnes Distribution achieved sales of $128.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decline of approximately 1 percent over the fourth quarter of 2006. Barnes Distributions organic sales decreased $5.7 million, or approximately 4 percent. The lower organic sales were due to softness in certain markets in North America, primarily the construction support and transportation related markets, and to the short-term effects of implementing Project Catalyst initiatives. Sales in Canada and Europe as reported in U.S. dollars were favorably impacted by the strength of the local currencies, increasing sales by approximately $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Barnes Distributions operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased $4.4 million. The fourth quarter of 2007 included costs related to Project Catalyst of approximately $4.7 million. These costs were partially offset through market pricing and lower incentive compensation, and the fourth quarter 2006 charge of $1.7 million taken for the Barnes Distribution France reorganization.
The full-year 2007 Barnes Distribution operating margin was 1.8 percent and includes costs of approximately $9.1 million associated with Project Catalyst. Project Catalyst costs were $1.4 million higher than the projected $7.7 million due to fourth quarter 2007 reductions-in-force. These actions relating to employee reductions were implemented following a comprehensive review of operations within the segment.
The organization continues to strengthen its efforts to enhance profit levels and maintain its commitment to superior customer service while continuing its intense focus on Project Catalyst. The early results from the actions taken in 2007 provide support for the Companys commitment to the significant operating profit performance improvement goal of 8 percent for 2008.
Project Catalyst Update
As previously announced Barnes Distribution initiated Project Catalyst, consisting of four initiatives: Global Product Sourcing, Logistics Network Optimization, Sales and Margin Improvement, and European Market Development. The goal of Project Catalyst is to service customers as effectively and efficiently as possible by leveraging Barnes Distributions expertise with the vendor-managed inventory model, and position the business for sustainable, profitable growth. During the fourth quarter, Barnes Distribution continued to make progress on each of the initiatives.
 The most significant activity during the quarter focused on the roll-out and implementation of Barnes Distributions new sales force compensation plan, effective January 1, 2008. The new compensation plan aligns the sales and profitability plans by focusing on retaining existing customers, penetrating existing customers through additional products and services, and adding new customers. Sales account representatives now have dynamic tools, including a new hand-held electronic device, and key customer servicing levers to provide greater support and strengthen their relationship with existing customers. These actions will further demonstrate the Barnes Distribution value for existing and new customers.
Sales and Margin Improvement
The new compensation plan communication and roll-out probably impacted sales force productivity negatively in the fourth quarter. Early sales results for 2008 indicate positive acceptance of the plan and the early adoption of the sales and pricing applications by many account representatives to achieve their profit and sales goals.
In addition, the market segment strategy is being implemented based on Barnes Distributions market strength within the transportation, manufacturing, and natural resources vertical segments. Initiatives include market-specific training, guidebooks, catalogs, and branding. Activities associated with the market segment strategy will be put into action throughout the year.
 The activity within the international sourcing center in Shanghai remains focused on improving the quality and cost of the supplier base. Progress is measured by the actual spend for globally sourced products versus total targeted global spend. Through the fourth quarter, Barnes Distribution remained on schedule and has identified new suppliers totaling nearly three-quarters of the 2008 targeted level for globally sourced products. These products are also aligned with the new sales force compensation plan to maximize sales for these high quality, price-competitive products.
Global Product Sourcing
 During the fourth quarter the relocation of the Edmonton, Alberta distribution center was completed, enabling Barnes Distribution Canada to provide a full range of products to maximize opportunities within natural resources, one of Barnes Distributions targeted vertical markets.
Logistics and Network Optimization
The implementation of the new warehouse management system, WMS, in the Dallas distribution center continued during the fourth quarter. Activities focused on establishing robust, integrated, and aligned best practice tools and processes, in order to maximize facility efficiency. A solid indicator of the progress within the Dallas distribution center is the consistent achievement of the targeted fill rates. The rollout of WMS to the Chicago and Reno distribution centers is planned during 2008.
 The KENT integration, which is a critical component of the European Market Development initiative, continues to move forward. The reorganization of the French business and the establishment of a single distribution center in Flers, France has been completed. Nearly 21,000 additional products have been added to the distribution center to better service our European customers. The alignment of the Belgium and Holland markets has also been completed. The business is focused on launching lean enterprise initiatives to refine and improve the logistics.
European Market Development
Barnes Industrial
Barnes Industrial completed another solid year of financial performance with improved operating margins. Investments and activities throughout the quarter and year were focused on organic growth and have positioned its diverse businesses for success in 2008.
Sales at Barnes Industrial for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $125.6 million, an increase of approximately 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales in Europe, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the strength of the local currencies increasing sales by approximately $6.2 million.
Barnes Industrials global focus continues to provide balanced and consistent results. European businesses continued to generate strong revenue growth as the markets remained healthy during the fourth quarter. Conversely, North American businesses continued to face organic growth challenges, particularly in the transportation end markets, including North American heavy duty truck, and telecom and electronics. Lower sales within the precision valves business were negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures in the compressor market due to the decline in consumer home product sales, coupled with a continued customer shift to low-cost countries and the associated localization of suppliers.
The general industrial end markets including tool-and-die and energy performed well during the quarter and the European businesses continued to record strong orders. In addition, backlog is at record level within these businesses.
Barnes Industrials fourth quarter 2007 operating profit of $14.1 million includes product rationalization and realignment activities, primarily at certain engineered springs locations, to further improve operations for sustainable, profitable growth. The activities resulted in a $2.6 million pre-tax expense. In addition, the Company expects to incur realignment costs of approximately $2.2 million pre-tax or $1.7 million after-tax, in 2008 or later which is expected to be offset by related savings. These realignment costs relate primarily to pension settlement costs, relocation costs and equipment transfer costs.
Fourth quarter 2007 operating profit was positively impacted primarily from increased sales within the nitrogen gas products and retention rings businesses, as well as productivity improvements within engineered springs.
Total Company
- The Company reported net sales of $358.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of $30.1 million or approximately 9 percent, over the fourth quarter of 2006. The sales increase reflected approximately $19.4 million of organic sales growth primarily at Barnes Aerospace. International sales were favorably impacted by the strength of their currencies as local currency sales translated into reported U.S. dollar sales of approximately an additional $10.7 million in 2007.
Revenues
- Cost of sales increased approximately 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of higher sales levels. The increase in cost of sales was slightly higher than the percentage increase in sales and resulted in a slight reduction in gross margin, to approximately 37 percent. The reduction in gross profit margin was driven primarily by the costs associated with Project Catalyst within Barnes Distribution. The lower gross profit margin was offset in part by increased sales in the Barnes Aerospace businesses and at Barnes Industrial, driven primarily by sales within certain higher margin businesses and operational efficiencies.
Cost of Sales and S&A
Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 11 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of approximately 29 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased slightly from the same period of 2006. This increase was due primarily to higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales at Barnes Distribution driven by Project Catalyst costs, and the $2.6 million reduction-in-force charges recorded at Barnes Industrial, and offset in part by increased Barnes Aerospace sales which have lower selling and administrative expense components.
 Operating income of $28.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 declined $0.8 million primarily due to the charge of approximately $2.6 million pre-tax within Barnes Industrial for a reduction-in-force, production realignment, and product rationalization and the $4.5 million in costs related to the investments in Project Catalyst. Partially offsetting this reduction was improved Barnes Aerospace performance and operating efficiencies within Barnes Industrial. Operating income margin for the quarter declined to 8.0 percent from 9.0 percent a year ago, primarily due to the actions taken within Barnes Industrial as well as a reduction in Barnes Distributions operating margin.
Operating Income
- Other expenses, net of other income, decreased $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange translation losses. Interest expense of $5.5 million decreased $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to a lower average interest rate driven in large part by the 3.375 percent convertible notes issued in the first quarter of 2007.
Other Income/Interest Expense
 The Companys effective tax rate for the full year 2007 was 20.3 percent, which resulted in an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 of 24.4 percent. Upon completion of the assessment of recent Mexican tax law changes and tax law changes in other countries, the Company recorded an additional deferred tax expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $2.4 million, which represents a non-cash decrease in net deferred tax assets.
Income Taxes
The Companys adjusted effective tax rate for the full year 2007 was 18.4 percent, a decline of 2.4 percentage points as compared to the effective tax rate of 20.8 percent for the full year of 2006. Changes in the Companys tax rate are largely dependent on the mix between domestic and international earnings. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2006 was primarily driven by lower Barnes Distribution results in North America and additional earnings from the RSPs in Singapore, a lower-tax jurisdiction. The tax rate for 2008 is expected to increase significantly due to the expected financial performance improvement within Barnes Distribution, which has a significant United States presence.
 Net income for the fourth quarter was $17.6 million, a decrease of approximately 5 percent over last year with diluted EPS of $0.30, a decrease of approximately 12 percent. Reported results include approximately $0.08 of diluted EPS due to actions taken within Barnes Industrial and the additional tax expense due to recent foreign tax law changes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, diluted EPS growth was adversely affected by an increase of approximately 8 percent in average diluted shares to 58.7 million, which includes the dilutive effect of the convertible notes. This dilutive effect was driven in large part by the increase in the Companys stock price.
Net Income
The weighted average diluted share count for the full year 2008 is projected to be approximately 62 million. Diluted average shares outstanding are impacted by changes in the Companys stock price. The Companys convertible notes, in particular, have a significant impact on the total diluted share count based on the average stock price. The chart below details the impact the convertibles have on total diluted shares for a given 2008 stock price.
The basis for calculating the dilutive effect of convertibles is the average stock price of the last 30 trading days of the quarter; as of 12/31/07 that price was $31.45.
(a)
- Cash was $20.6 million at the end of the quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 40 percent, at the low end of the Companys targeted range of 40 to 45 percent. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.14 times versus a total debt covenant of 4.0 times, and allows for additional borrowings in excess of the currently unused credit line of $379.1 million.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating activities provided $120.3 million in cash for the full-year 2007 compared to $114.3 million in 2006. Compared to the 2006 period, operating cash flows in the 2007 period were positively impacted by improved operating performance.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $17.3 million. Full year capital expenditures total $50.2 million and were directed primarily to investments needed to increase capacity and improve operational efficiency. Depreciation and amortization for the full year 2007 was $50.6 million.
 Based on current market conditions, managements projections for 2008 are as follows:
Projections for 2008
EPS - $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share; a 25% to 30% increase over reported 2007 results.
Diluted Shares  approximately 62 million.
Barnes Aerospace operating margin  19.0% to 20.0%, slightly up from 18.9% in 2007 and including approximately $3 million of expenses related to the Ogden facility expansion. Recently announced delays of the Boeing 787 have been considered in Barnes Aerospaces 2008 outlook.
Barnes Distribution operating margin  8.0%; up from 1.8% in 2007.
Barnes Industrial operating margin  approximately 14.0%, in-line with the 2007 level.
Tax rate  approximately 23% to 25%, an increase over the 2007 rate primarily due to improved financial performance within Distribution.
Debt to Capitalization ratio  in the 40% to 45% range.
Capital expenditures  $45 to $50 million, primarily related to investments needed to increase capacity and improve operational efficiency.
Depreciation and amortization  approximately $56 million.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 13, 2008, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") took the following actions with respect to the named executive officers of the Company as identified in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 10, 2007 (the "named executive officers") other than Mr. Edmund Carpenter who retired December 31, 2006:
A. Executive Compensation.
 
 
No long-term incentive awards were granted to Mr. Patrick J. Dempsey, Vice President, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Barnes Distribution, at the February 13, 2008 meeting of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Dempsey long-term incentive grants on February 14, 2007, which included amounts for the current year.
Restricted Stock Units
Each restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive, without payment to the Company, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock") equal to the number of restricted stock units that become vested and to receive dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Common Stock on each date on which a dividend is paid to the holders of Common Stock. The restricted stock units vest 33.34% on August 13, 2010 and 33.33% on each of August 13, 2011 and August 13, 2012.
The restricted stock units become non-forfeitable in the event the holder retires on or after February 13, 2009; provided, that the holder is at least 62 years old and has at least five years of service (a "Qualified Retirement") and executes a covenant not to compete and release of claims.
The restricted stock units will be accelerated and become payable upon termination of the holder due to the holder's death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the holder's termination for any other reason, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be forfeited.
Performance Share Awards
The performance share awards are to be earned as follows: 33.34% for fiscal year 2008 and 33.33% for each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010, upon attainment of designated basic earnings per share; provided, that upon a change in control of the Company, all of the performance share awards shall be deemed to be earned.
In the event of a voluntary termination, involuntary termination with or without cause or a Qualified Retirement, the holder shall forfeit all unearned performance share awards. In the event of termination due to death or disability, any performance share unit awards earned in the year of such termination shall be paid and the reminder shall be forfeited.
On or about March 1 of each year following the year in which the performance share awards are earned, the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of earned awards will be delivered to the named executive officers. Dividend equivalents on all earned performance share unit awards, if any, will be paid at the same time and same rate as dividends are paid on outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Stock Options
All of the stock options granted to Messrs. Milzcik, Denninger and Arrington, and Ms. Gates shall vest at the rate of 33.34% on August 13, 2009 and 33.33% on each of August 13, 2010 and August 13, 2011. The exercise price of each stock option is $ 26.38005, the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the date of the grant, determined in accordance with the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan.
In the event of a termination due to death, disability or a change in control of the Company, the stock options will become exercisable in full. In the event of a death or disability termination, the stock options may be exercised within one year of such termination.
In the event of an involuntary termination without cause, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options. In the event of an involuntary termination for cause all stock options are forfeited. In the event of a voluntary termination, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and vested options shall terminate as of the last day of employment.
In the event of a Qualified Retirement on or after February 13, 2009, so long as the holder executes a covenant not to compete, stock options shall continue to vest as scheduled. If the holder does not execute such covenant, unvested stock options shall be forfeited. If the holder also executes a release of claims, the holder shall have five years from the retirement date to exercise vested stock options. If the holder does not execute such release, the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options.
Other Action
With respect to the remaining performance share awards granted to each of Messrs. Milzcik, Denninger, Arrington, and Dempsey and Ms. Gates in 2005, 2006, and 2007 to be earned in fiscal 2007 upon attainment of targeted basic earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the shares granted in 2005 and available to be earned for fiscal 2007, and 125% of the shares granted in 2006 and 2007 and available to be earned in fiscal 2007, had been earned as set forth below:
 
The Compensation Committee approved the following with respect to the named executive officers.
 
No salary action was taken for Mr. Dempsey. On October 5, 2007, when Mr. Dempsey was appointed President, Barnes Distribution, his salary was set at an annual rate of $405,000.
The Compensation Committee granted the following cash bonuses pursuant to the Company's Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Executive Officers ("PLBP") to the named executive officers. The grants were based in the case of Messrs. Milzcik, Denninger, and Arrington and Ms. Gates on target 2007 revenue and earnings per share levels set on December 13, 2006 by the Compensation Committee and in the case of Mr. Dempsey on target 2007 unit operating performance levels set on December 13, 2006.
 
The Compensation Committee established the target revenue and earnings per share amounts and unit operating levels with respect to bonus payouts under the PLBP for fiscal year 2008 at its December 13, 2007 meeting.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and distributor, today reported first quarter 2008 net income growth of 21 percent to $33.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to the prior year first quarter.  The increase in net income reflects 8 percent revenue growth driven primarily by strong demand in the international industrial and aerospace manufacturing and aftermarket businesses.  Operating income improved 16 percent over the prior year first quarter and operating margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 12.8 percent.  First quarter improvements were driven primarily by record operating profit in Barnes Aerospace, continued strength in Barnes Industrial, and improved contributions from Barnes Distribution due to the positive impact of organizational and operational initiatives.
Bristol, Connecticut, May 2, 2008 ---
Companies that have embraced globalization, like Barnes Group, are well positioned for success through these uncertain economic times, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  Our record first quarter results demonstrate the success we are achieving in executing our strategies.  We will continue to make progress in delivering on our growth strategies and remain diligent in taking the necessary and deliberate steps for achieving consistent, sustainable, and predictable results, continued Milzcik.
Once again Barnes Groups operations provided solid overall financial performance, said William C. Denninger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  We believe we are well positioned in this business environment, given our international reach in the aerospace and industrial markets as well as our ongoing transformation of Barnes Distribution.  As a result, we expect to continue to realize sales and earnings growth while prudently investing in our future.  The Companys targeted earnings for full year 2008, based on current market conditions, have increased to $2.30 to $2.39 per diluted share from $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share, reflecting an anticipated increase over 2007 reported results of 31 percent to 36 percent, continued Denninger.

On February 19, 2008, the Company sold the net assets of Spectrum Plastics Molding Resources, Inc., a business of Barnes Industrial, for approximately $6.4 million.  The transaction loss of $1.2 million, or $0.8 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted earnings per share), was recorded in the first quarter of 2008.  Spectrum Plastics sales in 2007 were approximately $13.0 million.
As previously reported, Barnes Group realigned its reportable business segments during 2007 by transferring the stock spring catalog and custom solutions business from Barnes Distribution to Barnes Industrial, whose Engineered Springs business manufactures many of the spring products sold by this business.  Segment information has been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect this change.
Barnes Aerospace
 
 
Through the first quarter of 2008, Barnes Aerospace continued to achieve sales and operating profit success.  Barnes Aerospace generated sales of $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 23 percent over the first quarter of 2007.  The first quarter 2008 sales increase reflects growth of 26 percent in aftermarket sales.  Contributing to aftermarket sales growth was the positive impact of additional Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) since the first quarter of 2007, strong industry fundamentals, and continued benefits from long-term maintenance and repair contracts.
Manufacturing sales increased 22 percent for the quarter on the strength of the sales order backlog.  The total order backlog at Barnes Aerospace at the end of the first quarter of 2008 was $465.6 million, down slightly from a record $472.6 million at December 31, 2007.  This total includes adjustments for delays in Boeings 787 airplane delivery schedule as well as raw material horizon changes.  Approximately 61 percent of the backlog at March 31, 2008 is expected to be shipped within the next 12 months.  Barnes Aerospace is focused on meeting increased sales volume in its manufacturing and aftermarket businesses by adding capacity in Singapore, Ogden, Utah, West Chester, Ohio and through rigorous lean enterprise activities.  Costs related to the new Ogden, Utah facility are estimated at approximately $2.0 million for full year 2008, with approximately $0.2 million incurred in the first quarter of 2008.  This new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility will enable Barnes Aerospace to take advantage of the growth opportunities for a wide range of aircraft engine and airframe applications, particularly the GEnx and Trent 1000 engines.
Barnes Group Inc. / 3
 
Barnes Aerospaces first quarter 2008 operating profit was a record $22.3 million, an increase of 33 percent from the 2007 period.  Barnes Aerospace has generated quarter-over-quarter growth in operating profit for 17 consecutive quarters.  Operating profit for the first quarter of 2008 was positively impacted by profit contribution from aftermarket RSPs as well as a sales volume increase in the manufacturing business, and operational improvements.  This was partially offset by increased expenditures in its maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) business to increase production capacity for current and expected future demand.
 
Barnes Distribution
 
Barnes Distributions 2007 Project Catalyst organizational and operational initiatives have begun to generate improvement during the first quarter of 2008.   The goals of Project Catalyst are to accelerate the efficiency and effectiveness of customer service by leveraging Barnes Distributions expertise with the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) model, and focus the business on growing profitable organic sales and achieving improved operating margins.  To that end, we believe we have established a firm foundation for consistent, sustainable, and predictable results.
Barnes Distribution achieved sales of $141.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of approximately 1 percent over the first quarter of 2007.  Barnes Distributions organic sales decreased $5.1 million, or approximately 4 percent.  The lower organic sales were due to softness in certain markets in North America, primarily the transportation-related and certain manufacturing segments, and sales force disruption in the United States and the United Kingdom.  A decrease in the number of U.S. sales personnel was anticipated as a result of various Project Catalyst initiatives.  Sales in Europe and Canada, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the strength of the local currencies, increasing sales by approximately $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Barnes Distributions operating profit for the first quarter of 2008 increased approximately 12 percent to $7.0 million and resulted in an operating margin improvement of 0.4 percentage points to 4.9 percent.  This improvement is attributable to the favorable impact of Project Catalyst initiatives in North America.  These initiatives are improving value pricing and sales productivity, and contributed to a net reduction in distribution costs.  The positive impact on operating profit in North America was partially offset by the profit impact of lower organic sales and lower profit levels in Europe.
Barnes Distributions North American business made substantial year-over-year progress, and achieved the highest quarterly margin since 1998.  Improvements have been made through a rigorous attention to servicing customers, sales of globally sourced items over higher cost domestic product, and the market segmentation strategy.  Activities in North America are focused on executing the fundamentals and fully effecting the market segmentation strategy.  Driving the business forward and taking advantage of the momentum realized in the first quarter are imperatives for success during the remainder of 2008.
Barnes Distributions overall results, while positive, underperformed expectations as the European business did not realize the necessary operational improvement during the first quarter.  A number of
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 4
 
steps were undertaken to stabilize and begin to advance the business in Europe.  First, a new leader with international experience has established a new European management team with increased focus on profits and operational inefficiencies.  Second, lean enterprise experts have been deployed to accelerate the improvement.  With the global sourcing processes and procedures firmly established for the North American operations, the European business will now have the opportunity to leverage the full complement of global sourcing activities.
Improved profit levels in the first quarter and our continuing commitment to superior customer service warrant our confidence that we can realize improvement throughout the year.  However, with slowing economic growth anticipated for the United States and disruption in our European business, the expectation for Barnes Distributions full-year operating margin is now in the 6 percent to 8 percent range.
Barnes Industrial
 
Barnes Industrial continues to provide improved, consistent and sustainable results.  The strength of Barnes Industrials global diversification strategy positively impacted results for the first quarter of 2008, including both strong sales and orders growth.  Investments and activities throughout the quarter and the rest of the year are focused on profitable sales growth, productivity and process improvements, and positioning Barnes Industrials diverse businesses for long-term success.
Sales at Barnes Industrial for the first quarter of 2008 were $135.6 million, an increase of approximately 4 percent over the first quarter of 2007.  Sales, primarily in Europe, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the strength of local currencies, increasing sales by approximately $8.8 million.  The sale of Spectrum Plastics resulted in a reduction in sales of approximately $2.4 million as compared to the 2007 period.
The general global industrial end markets, including tool-and-die and energy, continued to perform well during the quarter.  On a regional basis, European and Asian businesses generated strong revenue growth as the economies remained healthy during the first quarter.  Conversely, North American-centric businesses continued to face organic growth challenges, particularly in the transportation and consumer home products end markets.  As a result, based on current market conditions, the slowing U.S. economy could have an adverse impact on Barnes Industrials global growth.
Barnes Industrials first quarter 2008 operating profit of $20.6 million increased approximately 3 percent from the prior year quarter.  First quarter 2008 operating profit was positively impacted by increased sales within the European and Asian businesses, as well as business-wide productivity improvements from lean enterprise activities.  Results were partially offset by higher employee-related costs and a quarter-over-quarter decline in operating profits at Spectrum Plastics which was sold in the first quarter of 2008.  Barnes Industrial continues to actively manage its exposure to raw material prices and potential supply constraints to help ensure future availability of raw materials at favorable prices.
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 5
Total Company
- The Company reported net sales of $388.6 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $27.9 million or approximately 8 percent, over the first quarter of 2007.  The sales increase reflected approximately $15.2 million of organic sales growth primarily at Barnes Aerospace.  International sales were favorably impacted by the strength of local currencies, which translated into reported U.S. dollar sales of an additional $15.1 million in 2007.  The sale of Spectrum Plastics resulted in a reduction in sales of $2.4 million as compared to the 2007 period.
Revenues
 
 
- Cost of sales increased approximately 9 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of higher sales levels.  The increase in cost of sales was slightly higher than the percentage increase in sales and resulted in a slight reduction in gross margin, to approximately 38 percent.  The decrease in gross margin was driven in large part by the shift in the overall sales mix from the higher gross margin distribution business to the lower gross margin aerospace business.
Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008 and at 25.4 percent of sales, decreased by 1.4 percentage points from the same period of 2007.  This decrease was due primarily to productivity improvements through lean enterprise activities in all three business segments and most significantly at Barnes Aerospace.
 Operating income of $49.9 million in the first quarter of 2008 increased $6.7 million.  All three business groups contributed to the increase in operating income, with Barnes Aerospace being the greatest contributor due to a significant improvement in results, driven by higher sales.  Operating income margin for the quarter increased to 12.8 percent from 12.0 percent a year ago, primarily due to improvements within Barnes Aerospace and at Barnes Distribution, which realized a considerable improvement in results within North America.
Operating Income
 Other expenses, net of other income, increased $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of the transaction loss of $1.2 million on the sale of Spectrum Plastics.  Interest expense decreased $1.7 million to $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.  The interest expense reduction was principally due to a lower average interest rate, driven in large part by a higher percentage of lower fixed-rate debt in the 2008 period compared to higher variable rate debt in the 2007 period, as well as a decline in variable debt interest rates.
Other Income/Interest Expense
 The Companys effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 22.2 percent, compared with 23.4 percent in the first quarter of 2007 and 20.3 percent for the full year 2007.  The increase in the effective tax rate from the full year 2007 rate was driven by improving Barnes
Income Taxes
 
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 6
 
Distribution results in North America, partially offset by additional earnings from the RSPs in Singapore, a lower-tax jurisdiction.  The tax rate for the full year 2008 is projected to be in line with the first quarter rate which is lower than the initial estimate of 23% to 25% due to stronger growth in lower-tax jurisdictions.
 Net income for the first quarter was a record at $33.4 million, an increase of 21 percent over last year with diluted EPS of $0.60, an increase of 20 percent.  Diluted EPS growth was adversely affected by an increase of approximately 2 percent in average diluted shares to 56.1 million.
Net Income
The weighted average diluted share count for the full year 2008 is projected to be in the range of 60 to 61 million.  The Companys convertible notes affect the total diluted share count depending on the Companys stock price.  The chart below details the impact the convertible notes have on total diluted shares for a given 2008 stock price as compared to the fourth quarter 2007 level.  The basis for calculating the dilutive effect of convertible notes is the average closing stock price of the last 30 trading days of the quarter; as of December 31, 2007, that price was $31.45.  The average closing stock price for Barnes Group Inc.s shares during the last 30 trading days of the first quarter of 2008 was $22.79.  Included in the projected full-year diluted share count is approximately 2.2 million shares from the estimated dilutive effect of the convertible notes.
 
 
- Cash was $22.2 million at the end of the quarter.  The debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 41 percent, at the low end of the Companys targeted range of 40 to 45 percent.  The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.37 times versus a total debt covenant of 4.0 times, and allows for additional borrowings of $341.0 million.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating activities used $10.5 million of cash flow in the first three months of 2008 compared to providing approximately $0.7 million in 2007.  Compared to the 2007 period, operating cash flows in the 2008 period were lower due to the higher working capital needs resulting from higher sales.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $12.1 million.  Depreciation and amortization for first quarter of 2008 were $13.1 million.
 Based on current market conditions, managements projections for 2008 are as follows:

NEWS RELEASE
 
BARNES GROUP INC. REPORTS
 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading international aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported third quarter 2008 net income of $28.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, an 8.5 percent increase in earnings per share over the prior year third quarter.  Operating income increased to $41.1 million and operating margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 12.2 percent over the prior year third quarter.  Operating income improved despite a decline in third quarter revenues of approximately 6.5 percent as a result of a slowing global economy and changing industry dynamics within the aerospace market.  Third quarter margin improvements were principally from continued progress in Barnes Distributions North American operations and strong Barnes Aerospace profits driven by continued operational improvements and cost reduction efforts.
BRISTOL, Conn., October 31, 2008
While current macroeconomic headwinds presented a challenge to our third quarter top line growth, our global diversification and differentiated business model proved resilient, resulting in year over year EPS growth for the third quarter, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
We are confident that the recently announced reorganization for our strategic business units will position the Company to proactively respond to anticipated economic challenges while realizing additional longer term synergies. We will continue to assess additional needs for production realignment and product rationalization to strengthen our long-term prospects. Looking forward, our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, combined with the advantages of a leaner organization, will position Barnes Group to withstand volatile market conditions, achieve sustainable growth, and deliver long-term stockholder value, added Milzcik.

Barnes Aerospace
 
Barnes Aerospaces results for the quarter were adversely impacted by declines in sales and orders as a result of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) strike at Boeing Company.   Barnes Aerospaces Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) operations were impacted by sharp schedule slides and lower activity levels primarily in the last two weeks of September.  Our OEM facilities are now executing plans focused on cost containment and cost elimination.  Revenue generated from components destined for a Boeing aircraft represent approximately one-third of Barnes Aerospaces total revenue, or approximately 10 percent of total Barnes Group revenue.  While the strike was disruptive, it does not change the long-term favorable outlook for the aerospace market and we expect that the robust aerospace industry fundamentals will remain.
The industrys solid global backlog and Barnes Aerospaces content on the engines that drive Boeings current aircraft lineup allow us to continue to invest for the future.   Our confidence is demonstrated through a recent long-term product line expansion agreement signed with a major OEM to manufacture pistons and cylinders for landing gear actuation systems on the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A380.  This new product family utilizes the strength of Barnes Aerospaces technology and manufacturing capabilities.  The term of the agreement is 14 years with sales forecasted at over $170 million.
OEM sales of $66.4 million declined 3 percent for the quarter driven by declines in commercial manufacturing as a result of the IAM strike, partially offset by growth in military sales.  The total order backlog at Barnes Aerospace at the end of the third quarter of 2008 was $407.0 million.  The total order backlog declined approximately 4 percent from the second quarter of 2008.  The sequential decrease was primarily a result of order delays relating to the IAM strike at Boeing and 787 deferrals associated with aircraft launch delays.  Approximately 61 percent of the backlog at September 30, 2008 is expected to be shipped within the next 12 months.
Aftermarket sales of $34.5 million were flat relative to the prior year third quarter.  The positive impact from quarter-over-quarter growth in aftermarket spare parts was offset by lower maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sales.  MRO sales were tempered during the quarter as airlines deferred maintenance activities and enacted capacity reductions as the result of oil prices that peaked in the quarter.  The recent decline in oil prices is likely to provide airlines with beneficial financial flexibility going forward.
Barnes Aerospaces third quarter 2008 operating profit of $22.4 million reflects an increase of 8 percent from the 2007 period.  Barnes Aerospace has generated growth in operating profit for 19 consecutive quarters.  The increase in operating profit for the quarter was primarily a result of the profit contribution from the increased sales of the higher margin aftermarket spare parts business and the positive impact of expense controls and lean improvement activities.  This was partially offset by higher costs in the MRO business as it continues to drive improvements in the manufacturing process of a new product line introduced last year.  Operating margins for Barnes Aerospace improved 2.1 points to a record level of 22.2 percent.

Barnes Distribution
 
Barnes Distributions vendor managed inventory and technical sales service and support delivery models are generating improved financial performance.  The organizations focus on generating profitable sales and stabilizing the sales ranks are providing added favorable momentum throughout the business.
Barnes Distribution sales of $123.5 million in the third quarter of 2008 reflect a decrease of approximately 6 percent from the third quarter of 2007.  Barnes Distributions organic sales decreased $9.6 million, or approximately 7 percent.  The lower organic sales were due to declines in certain markets in North America, primarily transportation and manufacturing-related segments, and lower organic sales in Europe, predominantly due to sales force disruption in the United Kingdom.  Sales, as reported in U.S. dollars, continue to be favorably impacted by the strength of the local currencies, increasing sales by approximately $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, primarily in Europe.  The favorable impact of currency translation will likely decline if the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies continues.
Barnes Distributions operating profit for the third quarter of 2008 more than doubled to $5.9 million and resulted in an operating margin improvement of 2.8 percentage points to 4.8 percent.  This improvement is primarily driven by solid execution on cost management and warehouse operations in North America, which achieved double-digit operating margins during the quarter.
Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, Barnes Distribution North America continued to make operational and financial headway.  North American operational initiatives continue to lower costs, drive sales force productivity, and improve pricing. Throughout the year, Barnes Distribution North America has generated favorable year-over-year progress and has continued to maintain its focus on the customer by providing a high level of service delivery.  Additionally, market segmentation strategies are identifying and targeting key customers that value our services in markets such as food processing and truck fleet.
The positive impact on operating profit in North America was offset by the underperformance in Europe which reported lower sales volumes and higher costs.  The European management team is coordinating efforts towards stabilizing and improving the operational performance and cost structure of the business and is considering structural changes to improve long-term profitability.
Barnes Industrial

Barnes Industrials results for the third quarter benefitted from the strategic focus on geographical and end market diversification.  Businesses in Europe and Asia which focus on the industrial and energy end markets provided sales growth that partially offset the significant downtrend in the North American transportation and consumer product end markets.  New product introductions along with a strong market presence in Europe and Asia, supported by a focus on cost reductions through lean activities, are providing new business opportunities in the face of declines in transportation-related activities and a slowing global economy.
Sales at Barnes Industrial for the third quarter of 2008 were $112.9 million, a decrease of approximately 10 percent from the third quarter of 2007.  Third quarter 2008 organic sales were down 11 percent due to sharp declines in the North American transportation and consumer product end markets.  Sales, primarily in Europe, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the strength of local currencies, increasing reported sales by approximately $3.7 million.  The favorable impact from currency translation will likely decline if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against local currencies.  The divestiture in March 2008 of Spectrum Plastics Molding Resources, Inc., a business of Barnes Industrial, resulted in a reduction in sales of approximately $2.8 million as compared to the 2007 period.
Barnes Industrials third quarter 2008 operating profit of $12.7 million decreased approximately 24 percent from the prior year quarter.  Third quarter 2008 operating profit was negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in the transportation-related end markets within North America.  Increased sales, operational improvements, and pricing initiatives within the European businesses partially offset the decline in the North American operations.  Looking ahead, improved long-term profitability is expected to be driven by organic sales growth, pricing initiatives, cost structure realignment, product rationalization, productivity improvements, and capacity reductions.  In addition, the global market for high quality precision components within many product and customer end markets provides favorable long-term prospects for Barnes Industrials diverse businesses.
Total Company
- The Company reported net sales of $337.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, a decrease of $23.3 million or approximately 6 percent, from the third quarter of 2007.  The decrease was a result of declines in all three segments due in part to slowing global economic conditions including a sharp decline in the North American transportation market and at Barnes Aerospace as a result of the impact on sales of the IAM strike at Boeing.  International sales were favorably impacted by the strength of local currencies, favorably impacting reported U.S. dollar sales by an additional $4.8 million in 2008.  Future positive influences on revenue will decline if foreign currencies continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar.  The sale of Spectrum Plastics resulted in a reduction in sales of $2.8 million as compared to the 2007 period.
Revenues
 
 
 
 
Barnes Group Inc.  \ 5
 
 Cost of sales decreased approximately 7 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of lower sales levels.  The decrease in cost of sales was greater than the percentage decrease in sales and reflects increases in gross margins at Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Distribution.
Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses were 25.6 percent of sales, reflecting a decrease of 0.5 percentage points from the same period of 2007.  This decrease was due primarily to the positive impact of expense reduction initiatives and lower compensation expenses.
 Operating income of $41.1 million in the third quarter of 2008 increased $1.0 million over the corresponding prior year period, in spite of lower year-over-year sales.  Operating income margin for the quarter increased to 12.2 percent from 11.1 percent a year ago, due to improvements within Barnes Aerospace and at Barnes Distribution which realized a substantial improvement in operating margin in North America.
Operating Income
 Other expenses, net of other income, decreased $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to the same period in 2007.  Interest expense decreased $1.4 million to $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2008.  The interest expense reduction was principally due to lower year-over-year interest rates.
Other Income/Interest Expense
 The Companys effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2008 was 21.1 percent, which resulted in an effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2008 of 20.5 percent, compared with 19.4 percent in the first nine months of 2007 and 20.3 percent for the full year 2007.  Changes in the Companys tax rate are largely dependent on the earnings mix between our global operations.
Income Taxes
 Net income for the third quarter was $28.9 million, an increase of 5 percent over last year with diluted EPS of $0.51, an increase of 9 percent.  Diluted average shares outstanding decreased 4 percent from the prior year to 56.3 million.
Net Income
The Companys option and restricted stock unit grants, along with the convertible notes, affect the total diluted share count depending on the Companys stock price.  The chart below details the impact the convertible notes have on total diluted shares for a given 2008 stock price as compared to the fourth quarter 2007 level.  The basis for calculating the dilutive effect of convertible notes is the average closing stock price of the last 30 trading days of the quarter; as of December 31, 2007, that price was $31.45.  The average closing stock price for Barnes Group Inc.s shares during the last 30 trading days of the third quarter of 2008 was $22.83.

 The Company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with a focus on long-term opportunities to enhance the strength of the Company.  The current credit markets continue to present companies with challenges in expanding credit lines.  Barnes Group has reviewed and currently expects its credit facilities will continue to be supported by its bank group.  In addition, these facilities coupled with cash generated from operations are ample for the Companys anticipated requirements.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating activities provided $43.0 million of cash flow during the quarter and $83.2 million in the first nine months of 2008.  Cash was $25.6 million at the end of the quarter.  The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 39.5 percent.  The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.14 times versus a total debt covenant of 4.0 times, and allows for additional borrowings of $410.4 million, well in excess of the Companys unused credit facilities.  At the end of the third quarter 2008, $202.8 million was borrowed at an interest rate of 3.64% under the Companys $400.0 million borrowing facility which matures in September 2012.  The Companys total borrowings are comprised of approximately 57% fixed rate debt and approximately 43% variable rate debt.  The Company has not issued commercial paper.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were approximately $15.9 million.  Depreciation and amortization for third quarter of 2008 were $13.3 million.
During the third quarter the Company paid a cash dividend per share of 16 cents ($0.16) and has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 16 cents ($0.16) per share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Barnes Group Inc. and its predecessor companies have paid a cash dividend to stockholders on a continuous basis since 1934.

(e) Compensatory Plans
Gregory F. Milzcik Employment Agreement
On December 11, 2008, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") and Mr. Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the "Amended Agreement"). The Amended Agreement amends Mr. Milzcik's employment agreement which was initially entered into December 13, 2006 and amended as of December 31, 2007 (the "Initial Agreement"). The Amended Agreement is effective as of December 31, 2008. The amendments were made principally to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and respond to a change in the Internal Revenue Service's policy regarding Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
A description of the principal amendments is set forth below.
Other Benefits
The Initial Agreement provided that the Company shall provide Mr. Milzcik with the use of a leased car with a monthly leasing cost to the Company not to exceed $1,131 per month and reimbursement for other expenses associated with the use of such leased car, and shall reimburse (not grossed-up for taxes) Mr. Milzcik for his membership in one club. The Amended Agreement provides that, in lieu of the foregoing, the Company may provide a monthly cash allowance to Mr. Milzick of $25,000.
Severance Payments
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Agreement, if Mr. Milzcik's employment is terminated by the Company other than for "Cause" (as defined in the Amended Agreement), and other than by reason of death or disability, or is terminated by Mr. Milzcik for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Amended Agreement), he will receive, in addition to the compensation and benefits provided by the Initial Agreement (which includes two years of salary, target bonuses and welfare benefits, and any benefits which may be due Mr. Milzcik under any plans, other than severance pay or salary continuation plans, which provide benefits after termination of employment):
 
 
In addition, the Amended Agreement changed the provision of the Initial Agreement that provided for performance shares or performance unit awards held by Mr. Milzcik on the date of termination and granted on or after October 19, 2006 (the "Commencement Date") to vest as if the applicable performance goal had been
 
achieved at target, to the extent they would have vested in accordance with their regular vesting schedule had his employment continued for two years after the date of termination. Under the Amended Agreement, performance shares or performance unit awards will vest as described in the preceding sentence. However, performance shares or performance unit awards for performance periods that begin after January 1, 2009 ("Post January 1, 2009 Awards"), will not vest as if the applicable performance goal had been achieved at target; rather, Post January 1, 2009 Awards will vest only if and when they would otherwise vest in accordance with the performance goals applicable to such Awards. Unlike the Initial Agreement, which provided for such performance shares or performance unit awards (including but not limited to Post January 1, 2009 Awards) to be paid when such awards would have been paid if Mr. Milzcik's employment had not terminated, the Amended Agreement provides for the timing of payment of such awards to be determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements.
Change in Control Benefits
 
 
 
 
 
Under the Amended Agreement, the provisions of the Initial Agreement described in the preceding sentence will apply only if the Change in Control qualifies as a Change in Control both as defined in the Amended Agreement and as defined in Treasury Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5). In addition, under the Amended Agreement, the two years of salary and bonus described in (i) above are to be paid in a lump sum, not at the time of termination, but on the first day of the seventh month after the date of termination.
 
All post-severance compensation arrangements will conform with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and any other tax, legal or regulatory restrictions in effect at the time of termination. Any amounts deferred shall bear interest for the period of the deferral at the applicable federal rate.
Other Amendments
In addition to the above-described changes, amendments were made in response to the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
 
 
10.1 Employment Agreement by and between the Company and Mr. Gregory F. Milzcik, as amended and restated as of December 31, 2008.

Recovery of Amounts Related to Restatement
 
Section 4.10 shall not apply to any award that has or had alternative vesting criteria unrelated to the performance objective affected by the Mandatory Restatement (an "Alternative Vesting Award") that have otherwise been satisfied at the time of the Mandatory Restatement.
The amount which the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company shall be the amount, if any, by which the compensation paid or received (or to be paid or received) exceeds the amount that would have been paid or received based on the financial results reported in the restated financial statements, in each case as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee, as constituted at the time of the relevant action; provided, however, that (i) no repayment will be payable in respect of an Alternative Vesting Award where the alternative vesting criteria have not yet been, but can still be, satisfied and the Compensation Committee has determined in good faith that the likelihood that such criteria will be satisfied is not immaterial; provided that the amount that would otherwise have been repaid to the Company in respect of any portion of such Alternative Vesting Award that does not become vested based on such alternative vesting criteria shall be due and payable promptly after the opportunity to satisfy the alternative vesting criteria has expired; (ii) the amount that the Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company from previously received compensation shall be reduced by the Net Tax Cost (as hereinafter defined) to the Executive of such compensation and (iii) to the extent that the price of the Company's common stock is or was a component of the performance objectives upon which the compensation was payable, the value of the stock taken into account for purposes of re-determining the level of achievement based on the restated financial results will be determined by reducing the reported stock prices during each accounting year affected by the Mandatory Restatement by an amount per share equal to the product of (A) the average weekly earnings per share multiples at which the Company's common stock traded for the 52 week period for such accounting year multiplied by (B) the amount by which earnings per share for such accounting year was reduced as a result of the Mandatory Restatement. If the Executive concludes that the amount to be repaid to the Company in accordance with subclause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence is excessive and inequitable, he may petition the Compensation Committee to review that determination. If the Compensation Committee agrees with the Executive's conclusion, it shall, in its sole discretion, specify an amount to be repaid to the Company that it concludes is equitable and appropriate under the circumstances. If the Compensation Committee does not agree that the formula produces a result that is excessive and inequitable, no adjustment shall be made in the amount to be repaid to the Company. The determinations, conclusions and other actions of the Compensation Committee in accordance with the two immediately preceding sentences shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and the Executive, and all persons claiming an interest through either such party.
A "Mandatory Restatement" shall mean a restatement of the Company's financial statements for 2006 or any year thereafter which, in the good faith opinion of the
 
Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, is required to be implemented pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, but excluding any restatement which is required with respect to a particular year as a consequence of a change in generally accepted accounting rules effective after the publication of the financial statements for such year. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a Mandatory Restatement shall not include any restatement that (i) occurs more than three years following the date that the Employment Term ends pursuant to Section 5 hereof or (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee"), (A) is required due to a change in the manner in which the Company's auditors interpret the application of generally accepted accounting principles (as opposed to a change in a prior accounting conclusion due to a change in the facts upon which such conclusion was based), or (B) is otherwise required due to events, facts or changes in law or practice that the Audit Committee concludes were beyond the control and responsibility of the Executive and that occurred regardless of the Executive's diligent and thorough performance of his duties and responsibilities. In addition, in determining the amounts, if any, that the Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company pursuant to this Section 4.10 (or that would be payable to the Executive in respect of any then in progress awards), all effects, whether positive or negative, of any change in the manner of reporting any transaction or class of transactions that the Audit Committee shall specifically agree to exclude for this purpose shall be disregarded.
"Net Tax Cost" shall mean the net amount of any federal, foreign, state or local income and employment taxes paid by the Executive in respect of the compensation received that is subject to reimbursement, after taking into account any and all available deductions, credits or other offsets allowable to the Executive (including, without limitation, any deduction permitted under the claim of right doctrine), and regardless of whether the Executive would be required to amend any prior income or other tax returns. The Executive agrees that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Company may seek reimbursement of such amounts from the Executive and may recapture such amounts by retaining the compensation or other amounts that would otherwise be due or payable to the Executive.
5. . The Executive's employment with the Company and the Employment Term shall terminate upon the expiration of the Employment Term, as specified in Section 1 hereof, or upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events of termination:
Termination
(a) By the Company (other than for Cause), immediately upon delivery of written notice to the Executive.
 
(b) By the Company for Cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice (the "Cause Notice") to the Executive. The Company may not terminate the Executive's employment for Cause unless such written notice is delivered to the Executive within ninety (90) days of the Board having actual knowledge of the action or omission constituting Cause (it being understood that knowledge by the Executive or any officer who reports to the Executive shall not constitute knowledge by the Board). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following receipt of such notice the Company may place the Executive on an administrative leave pending completion of the process established under this Section 5(b). During the term of such leave, the Executive shall be entitled to receive all compensation and benefits due under this Agreement pending completion of the process described herein, and the consequences of placing the Executive on such leave shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his employment hereunder. "Cause" shall mean () the willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform the Executive's duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, () the willful engaging by the Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or its subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise, () the Executive's conviction for the commission of () a felony or () any other crime involving moral turpitude, () a willful and material breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement which is not cured within twenty (20) days of receipt of written notice thereof from the Board which specifies the nature of such breach, () a violation by the Executive of any policy of the Company that is generally applicable to all employees or all officers of the Company including, but not limited to, policies concerning insider trading or sexual harassment, or the Company's code of conduct, that the Executive knows or reasonably should know could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the Company or material damage to its business reputation; and () the Executive's failure to cooperate, if requested by the Board, with any investigation or inquiry into his or the Company's business practices, whether internal or external, including, but not limited to, the Executive's refusal, after a written request by the Company's internal or external legal counsel, to be deposed or to provide testimony at any trial or inquiry, which is not cured within twenty (20) days of written notice from the Board which specifies such failure. For purposes of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's act, or failure to act, was in the best interest of the Company. The Executive shall have the right to appear before the Board, with his counsel present

The Executive may request a meeting with the Board by submitting a written request to the Board within ten (10) days of receipt of the Cause Notice. Such meeting with the Board shall be fixed and shall occur on a date selected by the Board (such date being not less than five (5) nor more than twenty (20) days after the Board receives the Executive's written request). Such meeting shall take place at the executive offices of the Company and the Executive shall have the right to address the Board for such period of time as established by the Board, but in no event less than thirty (30) minutes. For all purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause, the effective date of such termination shall be the date of delivery of the Cause Notice.
(c) By the Executive for Good Reason upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Board. The Executive may not terminate his employment for Good Reason by reason of any event or action unless such written notice is delivered within ninety (90) days of the Executive having actual knowledge of such event or action. "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following, unless specifically approved by the Executive in writing prior to the event or action: () a materially adverse change in the Executive's title, position, duties, responsibilities or reporting relationships, () a reduction in the Salary or failure to pay compensation or benefits, () a change in location of the Company's executive offices to a location which is more than fifty (50) miles away from both the location of the Company's current executive offices and the Executive's residence, () the assignment to the Executive of duties materially inconsistent with the Executive's status as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, () if the Company purports to terminate the Executive under Section 5(b) hereof, the Company's failure to provide the Executive () thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intention to terminate his employment for Cause in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof or () the opportunity to appear before the Board in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof, () the Company notifies the Executive of its intention not to extend the Employment Term pursuant to Section 1 hereof, () at any time during the Employment Term, the Company does not nominate the Executive for re-election to the Board or fails to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Executive to be re-elected to the Board, in either case, in accordance with Section 2 hereof, and/or () any other material breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(d) By reason of the Disability of the Executive. The Executive shall be considered to be disabled (i) after he has been unable fully to perform the substantial portion of his duties hereunder, with reasonable accommodation as required by law, by reason of physical or mental illness for 180 days during any 360 day period or (ii) if in the written medical opinion of a medical doctor mutually acceptable to the Executive and the Company, the Executive has a condition that makes it reasonably likely that the Executive will be unable to perform the substantial portion of his duties hereunder for a period of at least 180 days (either such circumstance shall hereafter be called a "Disability"). In the event that the Executive and the Company cannot agree upon a medical doctor to provide an opinion of the kind contemplated in the immediately preceding sentence, each shall appoint a medical doctor of its or his choice and those two medical doctors shall then appoint a third medical doctor to make the determination.
(e) By reason of the death of the Executive ("Death").
In the event of termination of the Employment Term, for whatever reason other than Death, () the Executive shall cooperate with the Company and be reasonably available to the Company with respect to continuing and/or future matters arising out of the Executive's employment or any other relationship with the Company (but not to unreasonably interfere with any employment or other business services or activities then being conducted by the Executive), whether such matters are business-related, legal or otherwise and () the Executive shall resign immediately from his membership on the Board and each Subsidiary Board.

6. . The following termination payments and benefits shall be provided to the Executive in lieu of any benefits provided in the Company's Executive Separation Pay Plan and such payments and benefits shall be paid or provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company plan, program or policy. Subject to Sections 9 and 14 hereof, the following payments upon termination shall constitute the exclusive payments and benefits due the Executive upon termination of Executive's employment, but shall have no effect on () any benefits which may be due the Executive under any plan, program or policy of the Company which provides benefits after termination of employment, other than any severance pay or salary continuation plan, which shall be inapplicable (the "Accrued Benefits"), and/or () the Executive's entitlement to reimbursements under Section 4.7 and 4.8 hereof.

For purposes of this Section 6.2, the "Severance Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date of termination and ending on the day before the second
 
anniversary of such termination date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in subclause (v) above, in the immediately following sentence with respect to any award referenced in subclause (vii) or (viii) or in Section 6.5, all payments to be made or benefits provided under this Section 6.2 shall be made and benefits provided when such payments or other benefits would have been made or provided if the Executive's employment had not terminated (e.g., so that the Executive shall be paid the amounts payable in respect of Salary in equal installments on the first working day of each month following the date of the Executive's termination of employment and the annual bonus amount related to the year in which the Executive's employment terminates shall be paid at the same time as annual bonuses are payable to other executives of the Company (and in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year of the Executive's termination)); provided, however, that any payment due under clause (iv) of the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 6.2 during the six month period following the date of termination shall be paid on the date which is six months and one day following the date of termination. With respect to any award referenced in subclause (vii) or (viii) of the preceding paragraph, the timing of payment in respect of such awards shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements. Each monthly payment to made under this Section 6.2 corresponding to the Executive's Salary, each payment in respect of the Executive's annual bonus and each other payment or provision of taxable benefits pursuant to Section 6.2(iii) hereof (including, without limitation, SEELIP premium payments and any related income tax gross-ups) shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments in accordance with the provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) and (iv). Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, the term "termination of employment" or any similar phrase or terms shall be interpreted to mean a "separation from service with the employer" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), where the "employer" means the Company and all corporations and trades or businesses with which the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code (as determined in accordance with the first sentence of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(3)).

Change of Control
 
in Control Event" with respect to Executive within the meaning set forth in Treasury Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5) on or after the date on which a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs, all outstanding restricted stock unit and performance share or performance unit awards then held by the Executive that were granted on or after the Commencement Date (including, but not limited to, the Commencement Options and the Commencement Units) that are not then vested shall immediately become vested and, in the case of performance share or performance units, assuming that the applicable performance objectives were achieved at the target level of performance. The Executive's rights and entitlements upon a Change of Control shall be governed exclusively pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and any prior agreements concerning his rights under a Change of Control, or any similar event, shall be of no further force and effect). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive's rights and entitlements with respect to any equity-based grants awarded prior to the Commencement Date shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the plan under which such award was granted and, if applicable, the agreements between the Executive and the Company governing the terms and conditions of such award. In the event that, within two years following a Change of Control that also is a "Change in Control Event" with respect to the Executive within the meaning set forth in Treasury Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5), the Executive is terminated by the Company (or its successor) without Cause, or terminates his employment for Good Reason, the Executive shall receive the severance benefits and other termination benefits described in Section 6.2, but modified or supplemented as follows:
 
 
 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, no severance benefits shall be payable to the Executive under this Section 6.4 to the extent that, following a Change of Control, his employment is terminated by reason of his death or his Disability.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if any event set forth in any one of the following paragraphs shall have occurred: ()"any person" (as defined herein) is or becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 as promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a "Beneficial Owner"), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its affiliates) representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities, but excluding any person who becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a transaction described in clause (a) of paragraph (iii) below; () the following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, on the Commencement Date, constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (

) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or () there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company with any other corporation, other than () a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, at least 60% of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or () a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its affiliates) representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or () the shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or () there is consummated an

agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an entity, at least 60% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale. For purposes hereof, "person" shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as modified amended from time to time and used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, except that such term shall not include (i) any member of the Barnes family (by blood or marriage) or any entity for the benefit of, or controlled by, a member of the Barnes family (by blood or marriage), (ii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iv) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (v) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment or other distribution shall be made upon a Change in Control with respect to any payment or benefit provided hereunder which constitutes "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and which is not otherwise grandfathered or exempt from the imposition of penalty tax thereunder, unless the event that constitutes a Change in Control also is a "Change in Control Event" with respect to Executive within the meaning set forth in Treasury Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5).
6.5 . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any payment to be made to the Executive in accordance with this Section 6 may be delayed or deferred by the Company in order to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules (including, without limitation, rules of any stock exchange on which the Company's shares are listed), so long as such action would not subject such payment to an additional tax pursuant to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and such delay or deferral is administered in accordance with Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(7)(ii). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, any payments due under this Section 6 within six months following the date of the Executive's termination of employment that are treated as deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or any successor or similar tax law or regulation, shall, if and solely to the extent necessary to cause the Executive not to be subject to the additional tax thereunder, be made six months and one day following such termination (or, if earlier, within ten (10) business days following the date of the Executive's death). If (i) any payment or provision of taxable benefits pursuant to Section 6.2(vi) hereof is delayed for six months following Executive's separation from service in order to avoid the penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and (ii) the Executive pays to an insurance carrier or, if applicable, to the Company, the applicable premiums that the Company would otherwise have paid during that six month period, Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company for any such
Compliance with Section 409A
 
premium payments that he has made during such six-month period, such reimbursement to be made on the date which is six months and one day following the Executive's separation from service with the Company. The amount of premiums eligible for reimbursement during a taxable year of the Executive may not affect the premiums eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year. Any amount or benefit deferred shall bear interest for the period of the deferral at the applicable federal rate determined in accordance with Section 1274 of the Code, and such interest shall be paid with and as part of the deferred payment on the six month and one day anniversary of the date of the Executive's termination of employment. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to any amounts which were earned and vested as of December 31, 2004 and not treated as subject to Section 409A of the Code by reason of the grandfathering provisions thereof and Treas. Reg. 1-409A-6 promulgated thereunder. Nothing in this Section 6.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement is intended to amend, revoke or limit in any way (a) the written consents the Executive gave in 2006, 2007 and 2008 to certain Code Section 409A-related amendments of his "Non-Grandfathered Compensation Arrangements" as defined in the award agreements issued to the Executive in those years under the Company's Stock and Incentive Award Plan, or (b) the Executive's agreement to the provisions of such award agreements relating to the use of an alternative method for identifying the "specified employees" who are subject to the six month delay required by Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and to the use of a December 31 "specified employee identification date" and January 1 "specified employee effective date" for identifying the "specified employees" who are subject to that six month delay. Any payments that may be made and benefits that may be provided pursuant to this Agreement are intended to qualify for an exclusion from Section 409A of the Code (including without limitation the exclusion for certain welfare benefits under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(a)(5), the exclusion for short-term deferrals under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(4), and the exclusions for separation pay plans under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(9)), and/or are intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code, so that none of the payments that may be made and benefits that may be provided pursuant to this Agreement will be includible in the Executive's federal gross income pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code. This Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed to carry out such intentions, and any provision of this Agreement that cannot be so administered, interpreted and construed shall to that extent be disregarded. However, any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company does not represent, warrant or guarantee that the payments and benefits that may be paid or provided pursuant to this Agreement will not be includible in the Executive's federal gross income pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code, nor does the Company make any other representation, warranty or guaranty to the Executive as to the tax consequences of this Agreement.
 
6.6 . Upon termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, he shall have no mitigation obligation hereunder; it being expressly agreed that if the Executive receives any income, payment or other benefit from a third party after any such termination, such income, payment or benefit shall not be set off against any payments or benefits to be made or provided to the Executive by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.
No Mitigation or Offset
6.7 . Nothing in this Section 6 shall be construed to accelerate the vesting of, extend the term of or otherwise modify any option or other equity-based or long-term incentive award granted to the Executive prior to the Commencement Date. The terms and conditions of any such awards shall be governed by the terms of the agreements pertaining thereto and the underlying plan documents.
No Impact on Prior Grants
7. .
Excise Tax Limitation
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or distribution of any type to or for the benefit of the Executive by the Company, any affiliate of the Company, any person who acquires ownership or effective control of the Company or ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and the regulations thereunder), or any affiliate of such person, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Total Payments") is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in the Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account Executive's applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax), than if the Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments. The Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating compensation or benefits that are treated as being entirely subject to the Excise Tax, starting with the portion thereof which is to be paid the farthest in time from the Determination (as hereinafter defined) and otherwise prioritizing the reduction or elimination of compensation or benefits based upon which elements of such compensation or benefits confer the least after-tax benefit on the Executive or his dependents (as applicable), taking into account the provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1. The Company shall make such determination after consultation with the Executive (or his financial and tax advisors if he so elects); provided, however, that the Company's determination shall be final and binding.
 
(b) The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 7(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the Company from among the four (4) largest accounting firms in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation, to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) days of the Termination Date. Absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive.

By and in consideration of the Company's entering into this Agreement and the Salary, other compensation and benefits to be provided by the Company hereunder (including, but not limited to, the Commencement Option and the Commencement Units), and further in consideration of the Executive's exposure to the proprietary information of the Company, the Executive agrees that the Executive shall not, during the Employment Term and for a period of two (2) years thereafter (the "Restriction Period"), directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed by, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected in any manner, including but not limited to, holding the position of shareholder, director, officer, consultant, independent contractor, employee, partner, or investor, with any Competing Enterprise. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "Competing Enterprise" shall mean any person, corporation, partnership or other entity engaged in a business which is in direct competition with any material or significant business of the Company or any of its affiliates at the relevant time (or, during the Restriction Period, at the date of termination of employment); , the direct or indirect parent of any entity that is in direct competition with the Company shall be considered to be in direct competition with the Company, but that nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from providing services to an entity affiliated with, but not directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by an entity that is in direct competition with the Company so long as the Executive does not, directly or indirectly, provide any services, advice or other assistance to such competing entity.

On December 17 and 18, 2008, the Company announced to impacted employees that certain non-core businesses of its Barnes Group (U.K.) Limited subsidiary will be exited. The non-core activities include the mobile sales force unit, the direct sales to car dealerships unit, and the systems business and catalog unit of Barnes Group (U.K.) Limited. The exit activities include a combination of (i) the sale of certain assets and the transfer of related employees among three purchasers and (ii) the liquidation of assets, termination of related contracts and severing of employees. Ninety-nine employees based in the United Kingdom were affected. The Company approved the proposal to take this action, subject to applicable UK employment law, on October 23, 2008. It is anticipated that the action will be completed by December 31, 2008. The total charges associated with this action are estimated to be approximately $3.7 million before taxes, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. Of the total charges, approximately $0.7 million are employee-related costs, including severance and other termination benefits; approximately $1.5 million are asset impairment charges; approximately $0.4 million are for contract termination costs; and approximately $1.1 million are for other costs. Approximately $2.2 million of the total charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures. These cash expenditures are expected to be largely offset by the sale of the warehouse used in connection with the activities. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $3.7 million will be recorded for the write-off of deferred taxes based on expected recoverability.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading international aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported several recent actions to improve the performance of the Company's Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment in Europe.
BRISTOL, Conn., December 19, 2008
Barnes Group's Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment is exiting certain non-core activities within its U.K. operations. The U.K. Motalink van business, based in Corsham, England, has been sold. In addition, certain assets of the U.K. direct sales to car dealerships unit and the systems business and catalog unit, based in Corsham, England, were sold. Terms of these transactions were not disclosed.
The Logistics and Manufacturing Services management team in Europe is also exiting the Corsham facility, eliminating the telesales and back office functions currently at the site. The Toolcom, U.K., and the Kent, U.K., businesses are not impacted by these actions. The Dunfermline, U.K. site will continue to support the Toolcom and Kent businesses. The results of the discontinued businesses, including the costs of the actions related to the exit, will be segregated and treated as discontinued operations in the Company's 2008 financial statements.
"The Logistics and Manufacturing Services European management team is actively working to stabilize and improve the operational performance and cost structure of the European operations," said Patrick Dempsey, President, Logistics and Manufacturing Services, Barnes Group Inc. "Eliminating non-core underperforming assets in the U.K. will provide for a more focused approach to the market," continued Dempsey.
The total charges associated with these actions are estimated to be approximately $3.7 million before taxes, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $3.7 million will be recorded for the write-off of deferred taxes based on expected recoverability. Revenues associated with the exited businesses were approximately $20.0 million in 2007. The reduction in fixed cost structure is expected to put Barnes Distribution Europe in a stronger position for success in the new year and the longer term.
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE:B) is a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company focused on providing precision component manufacturing and operating service support. Founded in 1857, the 5,700 dedicated employees at more than 70 locations worldwide are committed to achieving consistent and sustainable profitable growth. For more information, visit .

(b) Retirement Agreement with Principal Accounting Officer
On February 11, 2009, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") and Mr. Francis C. Boyle, Jr., the Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company, completed an agreement effective January 12, 2009 pursuant to which Mr. Boyle will retire from the Company effective March 1, 2010.
 
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On February 10, 2009, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company took the following actions with respect to current executive officers of the Company who were "named executive officers" in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 4, 2008, and with respect to Christopher J. Stephens, Jr. who joined the Company effective January 12, 2009:
Each of the awards described below was made pursuant to, and is governed by, the terms of the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan, which has been approved by the Company's stockholders. The Compensation Committee granted these long-term incentive awards at a level that represents an approximately 10% reduction of the fair market value at date of grant as compared to the value of long-term incentive awards made to executive officers in 2008 (with a theoretical fair market value for stock options in each case determined using the binomial valuation method applied consistently with the Company's practice).

Restricted Stock Units
Each restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive, without payment to the Company, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock"), equal to the number of restricted stock units that become vested and to receive dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Common Stock. The restricted stock units vest 33.34% on August 10, 2010 and 33.33% on each of August 10, 2012 and August 10, 2013. Of the restricted stock units granted to Mr. Dempsey, 10,700 units will vest according to the indicated schedule and the remaining 21,800 units will vest 20% on the third anniversary of grant, 20% on the fourth anniversary of grant and 60% on the fifth anniversary of grant.
The restricted stock units become non-forfeitable in the event the holder retires on or after February 10, 2010; provided, that the holder is at least 62 years old and has at least five years of service (a "Qualified Retirement") and executes a covenant not to compete and release of claims.
The restricted stock units will be accelerated and become payable upon termination of the holder due to the holder's death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the holder's termination for any other reason, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be forfeited.
Performance Unit Awards
Under the performance unit awards the executives have the right to receive a cash payment per unit awarded upon the achievement of basic earnings per share goals established by the Committee. The performance unit awards are to be earned as follows: 33.34% for fiscal year 2009 and 33.33% for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011. In the event of a change in control of the Company, all of the performance unit awards shall be deemed to be earned.
In the event of a voluntary termination, involuntary termination with or without cause or a Qualified Retirement, the holder shall forfeit all unearned performance unit awards. In the event of termination due to death or disability, any performance unit awards earned in the year of such termination shall be paid and the reminder shall be forfeited.
On or about March 1 of each year following the year in which the performance unit awards are earned, a specified dollar amount equal to the number of earned units multiplied by the per share fair market value of the Common Stock on the date preceding the payment date will be delivered to the officers.
Stock Options
All of the stock options granted to Messrs. Milzcik, Stephens and Dempsey, and Ms. Gates shall vest at the rate of 33.34% on August 10, 2010 and 33.33% on each of August 10, 2011 and August 10, 2012. The exercise price of each stock option is $11.45, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, determined in accordance with the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan.
 
3
 
 
In the event of a termination due to death, disability or a change in control of the Company, the stock options will become exercisable in full. In the event of a death or disability termination, the stock options may be exercised within one year of such termination.
In the event of an involuntary termination without cause, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options. In the event of an involuntary termination for cause all stock options are forfeited. In the event of a voluntary termination, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and vested options shall terminate as of the last day of employment.
In the event of a Qualified Retirement on or after February 10, 2010, so long as the holder executes a covenant not to compete, stock options shall continue to vest as scheduled. If the holder does not execute such covenant, unvested stock options shall be forfeited. If the holder also executes a release of claims, the holder shall have five years from the retirement date to exercise vested stock options. If the holder does not execute such release, the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options.
Action Regarding Outstanding Long-Term Incentive Grants
With respect to outstanding performance share awards granted to each of Messrs. Milzcik, Arrington, and Ms. Gates in 2006, 2007 and 2008 to be earned in 2008 upon attainment of targeted basic earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that 50% of the target number of shares under 2006, 2007 and 2008 awards available to be earned in 2008, had been earned as set forth below:
Performance Share Awards Earned Based on 2008 Performance
 
Mr. Stephens joined the Company effective January 12, 2009 and therefore did not receive any prior grants of performance share awards.
The Company has implemented a freeze on all salary levels for all salaried employees, including all executive officers.
The Compensation Committee granted the following cash bonuses pursuant to the Company's Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Executive Officers ("PLBP"). The grants were based, in the case of Messrs. Milzcik and Arrington, and Ms. Gates,
 
4
 
 
upon achievement of a 2008 basic earnings per share goal set in December 2007 by the Compensation Committee. By prior agreement, Mr. Dempsey's bonus award is to be paid at a target level bonus based on the performance of the Aerospace unit. Mr. Dempsey was President of the Company's Aerospace unit until October 2007, when he assumed responsibility for the Distribution unit. The Company agreed to provide Mr. Dempsey with the Aerospace bonus at the minimum target level so that he would not have a disincentive to assume the new role. Mr. Stephens joined the Company effective January 12, 2009 and therefore was not eligible for a 2008 award.
 
At its February 10, 2009 meeting, the Compensation Committee established performance goals for 2009 under the PLBP regarding: (a) basic earnings per share of the Company; (b) performance profit after tax ("PPAT"), as previously calculated under the PLBP, of each of the Company's reclassified segments (Logistics and Manufacturing and Precision Components); and (c) a new performance metric established by the Committee based on the working capital of the Company and each of the segments. 80% of each executive's annual incentive award opportunity is based on basic earnings per share of the Company or PPAT of the applicable segment and 20% is based on the working capital metric.
On February 11, 2009, the Company and Mr. Christopher J. Stephens, Jr. completed a severance (change in control) agreement effective as of January 12, 2009 in substantially the same form as generally entered into between the Company and its executive officers. The agreement is automatically extended for one year on each January 1st unless notice not to extend the agreement is provided by September 30 of the preceding year.
The severance agreement provides, among other things, that upon the occurrence of a change in control, Mr. Stephens is entitled to a cash payment equal to a prorated target annual bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs (subject to offset by the amount of annual and other bonuses that are otherwise paid to Mr. Stephens with respect to such year). Also, upon the occurrence of a change in control, Mr. Stephens is fully vested in all options held by him, and other stock-based awards held by Mr. Stephens will vest to the extent provided for in the award agreements evidencing such awards.
In addition, if, following a change in control, Mr. Stephens' employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause or if Mr. Stephens voluntarily terminates employment for good reason, then he is entitled to severance payments and benefits conditioned on him executing a release of all claims and liabilities of any kind relating to his employment and his termination of employment. These payments and benefits consist of: (i) an amount
 
5
 
 
equal to the severance pay to which he would be entitled under the Company's Executive Separation Pay Plan; (ii) a cash payment equal to two times his most recent base salary and two times the highest of his annualized average annual bonus for the years (up to three) prior to his employment termination or the change in control or the target bonus for the year in which separation from service occurs, minus the amount paid in (i) above; (iii) a cash payment equal to a prorated target bonus for the year in which the separation from service occurs (less any pro rata bonus previously paid for the same period); (iv) 24 months of additional age credit, benefit accruals and vesting credit under the Company's non-qualified and qualified retirement plans; (v) an amount equal to 24 multiplied by the value of Mr. Stephens' average monthly perquisites (as in effect on the date of termination); (vi) 24 months continued participation in any welfare plans of the Company in which Mr. Stephens was participating at the time of his employment termination including without limitation health care benefits on a tax-free basis and continued participation in the Company's Senior Executive Enhanced Life Insurance Program to the extent that Mr. Stephens is a participant in that plan at his employment termination.
If Mr. Stephens becomes entitled to health, welfare, pension and other benefits of the same type as referred to above during the 24-month period following employment termination, the Company will stop providing these benefits to him.
The agreement also provides that, if any payment or benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the severance payments and benefits to Mr. Stephens will be reduced if and to the extent that reducing the payments and benefits would result in the executive's retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis, than if he received the entire amount of such payments and benefits.
On February 10, 2009, the Company and Mr. Stephens completed an Incentive Compensation Reimbursement Agreement effective as of January 12, 2009. The reimbursement agreement with Mr. Stephens provides for, in certain circumstances, a "claw-back" of any cash or equity awards earned by Mr. Stephens that are based on achieving specified financial performance targets if, subsequent to the awards, the Company restates financial statements (with exceptions for restatements not caused by misconduct or error) to comply with generally accepted accounting principles requirements and financial results are lower than those upon which awards were calculated. The amount to be potentially clawed back is the excess of awards received (net of taxes paid by Mr. Stephens) over those which would have been earned based on restated financial results. However, the claw-back provision does not apply to amounts received by Mr. Stephens with regard to equity-based compensation that has a vesting schedule based on the passage of time and the continued performance of services, and not on the achievement of any performance objectives or to any award granted Mr. Stephens that has or had alternative vesting criteria unrelated to the performance objectives affected by the mandatory restatement that have otherwise been satisfied at the time of the mandatory restatement. In addition, if Mr. Stephens concludes that the amount to be repaid to the Company in accordance with the claw-back provisions is excessive and inequitable, he may petition the Compensation Committee to review that determination. If the Committee agrees with Mr. Stephens' conclusion, it shall, in its sole discretion,
 
6
 
 
specify an amount to be repaid to the Company that it concludes is equitable and appropriate under the circumstances. If the Compensation Committee does not agree that the formula produces a result that is excessive and inequitable, no adjustment will be made in the amount to be repaid to the Company. The determination, conclusions and other actions of the Compensation Committee will be conclusive.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a leading international aerospace and industrial components manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported a loss of $4.4 million from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2008, or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share, including the after-tax impact from discrete actions, of $14.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share.  The Company reported fourth quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $19.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.  Barnes Groups fourth quarter 2008 sales of $265.4 million were down 25 percent over the same period of 2007.
BRISTOL, Conn., February 19, 2009
For the full year 2008, Barnes Group achieved sales of $1.36 billion, down 4 percent from 2007.  Reported income from continuing operations for the full year 2008, which includes the impact from discrete actions, was $97.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, compared to reported income from continuing operations of $103.6 million or $1.80 per diluted share in 2007.
The Company took significant discrete actions during the fourth quarter to counter the dramatic downturn in the worldwide economy and credit markets.  These actions were proactive steps to position the Company for consistent and sustainable profitable growth over the longer term and when the current uncertain economic environment improves.  These included actions related primarily to workforce reductions, transfer of work to address current and expected market conditions, and the valuation of certain deferred tax assets.
As a result of the actions, included in the 2008 fourth quarter income from continuing operations are pre-tax charges of $12.8 million ($14.3 million after-tax).  Approximately $5.3 million pre-tax ($9.2 million after-tax) is a result of actions taken within the Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment and approximately $7.5 million pre-tax ($5.1 million after-tax) is a result of actions taken within the Precision Components segment.  The after-tax amounts include a provision for the valuation of certain deferred tax assets.
Adjusted income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008, which excludes discrete actions, was $9.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.  For the full year, adjusted income from continuing operations was $111.3 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted non-GAAP results are presented to reflect the financial results of the business if certain discrete actions had not been undertaken.
In addition, during the quarter the Logistics and Manufacturing Services business exited certain non-core activities within the United Kingdom (U.K.).  The results of the discontinued U.K. businesses, including

the costs of the actions related to the exits, have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations in the reported financial statements.
The financial benefits of the progress we made throughout 2008 in streamlining our operations and our organizational structure were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global economy, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  In spite of the global economic crisis, we delivered strong financial performance for 2008 while continuing to position the Company for future growth and expanded profitability.  We have made prudent decisions to align our cost structure with market demands to enable us to remain globally competitive.  We will continue to evaluate our business and explore avenues to create opportunities to weather the current economic storm and prepare for the eventual turnaround.  Barnes Group has been in business for more than 150 years.  No matter the economic down cycle, we have continued to grow and prosper, and we expect to emerge from this one stronger and more competitive than ever, Milzcik added.

Stephens, Jr., Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
We believe that our diversified portfolio of businesses, strong balance sheet, and our recent cost-saving actions position the Company to manage through these challenging economic times.  As a result, the Companys targeted earnings for the full year 2009, based on current market conditions, are $1.20 to $1.50 per diluted share, added Stephens.

NEWS RELEASE
 
BRISTOL, Conn., May 4, 2009
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported financial results for the first quarter 2009.  In the first quarter of 2009 Barnes Group reported income from continuing operations of $11.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $33.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Barnes Groups first quarter 2009 sales totaled $262.2 million, down 31.7 percent from $384.0 million in the first quarter of 2008.
 
 
Despite the macroeconomic pressures impacting all of our businesses, our decisive actions continue to position the Company for short-term and long-term success.  Unprecedented headwinds have continued to affect our sales negatively, particularly those related to the transportation markets, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  The strategic, proactive cost saving actions we implemented last year have enabled the Company to generate positive results during this very difficult first quarter.  Our strategic actions remain on track to deliver targeted savings and our cash flow outlook remains favorable.  We continue to aggressively act on further efficiency improvements in our businesses in addition to those previously announced and believe these actions will provide benefits in the second half of this year.
The Company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with favorable debt maturity schedules and our credit facilities, coupled with cash generated from operations, offer the flexibility to meet our near-term requirements while pursuing our long-term objectives.  During the quarter we paid a cash dividend per share of 16 cents, demonstrating our commitment to returning value to our stockholders.  We continue
Barnes Group Inc.  \ 2
 
to make investments during this downturn to manage our business more efficiently, expecting that our improved operating leverage will establish a more profitable platform and a more competitive position for Barnes Group as the markets recover, Milzcik added.

2009 Outlook
We have focused on aligning our cost structure with changing demand levels, improving working capital to enhance our cash generation, and pursuing growth opportunities when conditions improve, said Christopher J. Stephens, Jr., Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
During the first quarter, cash from operations of $5.4 million improved $15.8 million from the first quarter of 2008.  Though difficult, we have taken the cost saving actions necessary to weather the economic downturn and position our business for an economic recovery.  Nevertheless, greater than expected declines in our transportation end markets combined with recently announced Boeing production reductions have tempered our full year outlook.  As a result, the Companys targeted earnings for the full year 2009, based on current market conditions, are $1.20 to $1.35 per diluted share, the low-end of our previously issued guidance, added Stephens.

On July 1, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $35,000,000 unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Lender and as Administrative Agent. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The available borrowing period under the Credit Agreement is from the Closing Date through December 31, 2009 ("Availability Period"). During the Availability Period the Company may borrow either under (i) Tranche A, which serves as a term loan and will amortize in ten quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2010 or (ii) Tranche B, which serves as a working capital facility, allows for reborrowing of amounts repaid and will amortize in six quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2010; provided, that, the outstanding loans under Tranche B may not exceed the lesser of $20,000,000 or $35,000,000 less any Tranche A loans outstanding from time to time; and provided further, that the aggregate outstanding loans under Tranches A and B of the Credit Agreement may not exceed $35,000,000. At the Company's option, the loans will bear interest either at LIBOR plus 4.25% or at Wells Fargo's Base Rate plus 1.75%. The Company paid an up front fee of $437,500. The Company is to pay a fee quarterly during the Availability Period equal to 0.50% of the unused commitment. The Credit Agreement's covenants are substantially the same as the covenants under the Company's $400,000,000 Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, dated September 19, 2007.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e) On July 22, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") took the following actions affecting certain executive officers of the Company.
(1) The Board authorized the Barnes Group 2009 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DC Plan"). Officers of the Company who are elected or appointed on or after January 1, 2009, which includes our current Chief Financial Officer, Christopher J. Stephens, Jr., are at the Board's discretion eligible to participate in the DC Plan. The DC Plan replaces the Company's Supplemental Senior Officer Retirement Plan which was closed to new participants as of December 31, 2008.
For each DC Plan participant, the Company will credit an annual hypothetical contribution equal to 20% of compensation above the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") Section 401(a)(17) limit (i.e., earnings taken into account for tax-qualified plan purposes, currently $245,000) or such other amount determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"). The hypothetical contributions credited will be adjusted according to the performance of investment options provided under the DC Plan documents and designated by participants. Subject to the Company's amendment and termination rights and other DC Plan and trust provisions, participants generally vest upon attaining the age of 55 and 10 years of service; provided that the Board may reduce the required years of service to 5 years for any given participant; and provided further that, for death and defined disabilities, vesting occurs if a participant is at least age 55 with 5 years of service. Distributions under the DC Plan generally are made in the form of 5 installments over a 4-year period. The Company intends to establish a grantor ("rabbi") trust in connection with the DC Plan and may choose to finance its obligations using that trust.
(2) The Board amended the Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan (the "RBEP") to provide that if an employee meets the minimum participation criteria for the RBEP (i.e., participates in the Company's qualified pension plan and is subject to benefit limitations under that plan because of Code Section 401(a)(17) or 415), the Compensation Committee is not required to individually designate that employee as an RBEP participant, although it has the discretion to exclude the employee from participation. Other RBEP amendments provide (a) that if, at separation from service or death, an employee has satisfied the age and service conditions for payment of a benefit under the DC Plan, an RBEP benefit shall not be paid to that employee and (b) for the payment of any separation from service and death benefits that are payable under the RBEP, in the case of an employee who also participates in the DC Plan, in the form of 5 installments over a 4-year period.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On September 30, 2009, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") authorized the restructure of operations of the Precision Components Segment by moving the operations of two facilities: Burlington, Ontario, Canada (the "Burlington Facility") and Monterrey, Mexico (the "Monterrey Facility"). The assets and related work of these facilities will be transferred to other Precisions Components facilities in the United States to create a more cost effective manufacturing footprint. The movement of operations for the Burlington Facility is expected to be completed by March 2010. The movement of assets at the previously idled Monterrey Facility is expected to be completed by March 2010.
 
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
Burlington Facility
The total pre-tax charges for the Burlington Facility associated with the restructure are estimated to be approximately $5.8 million, of which approximately $2.7 million is expected to be recognized in 2009. The amount recognized in 2009 relates primarily to employee termination costs. The balance of $3.1 million is expected to be recognized in 2010 and beyond. Approximately $2.0 million of the $3.1 million relates to pension costs. The balance relates to equipment relocation costs and transfer costs. Approximately $5.0 million of the approximate $5.8 million in total pre-tax charges is expected to result in future cash expenditures.
Monterrey Facility
The total pre-tax charges for the Monterrey Facility associated with the restructure are estimated to be approximately $1.2 million of which approximately $0.4 million is expected to be recognized in 2009 and the remainder in 2010. Approximately $0.5 million of the total charges are lease related costs and approximately $0.7 million are equipment transfer expenses and other related costs. All of the approximate $1.2 million in pre-tax charges is expected to result in future cash expenditures.
 
Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
Monterrey Facility
In connection with the restructure of the Monterrey Facility it was determined on September 30, 2009 that a non-cash fixed asset impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million is required to be recognized in 2009 related to equipment installation costs and related fixed asset costs at the Monterrey Facility. There will be no cash expenditures related to this impairment charge.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2009.  The Company reported income from continuing operations of $10.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $29.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Included in the third quarter 2009 results are $3.4 million pre-tax ($1.7 million after-tax) of restructuring charges.  Barnes Groups third quarter 2009 sales totaled $260.3 million, down 22 percent from $333.8 million in the third quarter of 2008.
BRISTOL, Conn., October 30, 2009
Barnes Group generated $125.7 million in cash from operations for the first nine months of 2009, reflecting an improvement of 51 percent over the prior year period level of $83.2 million.  Cash flow generation driven by working capital improvements helped reduce debt to $360.7 million, a decline of 23 percent from year-end 2008.  As a result, the Companys third quarter 2009 debt-to-capital ratio improved to 35%.  The Companys September 30, 2009 total debt covenant ratio of 3.26 times was appreciably below the required level of 4.0 times.  On December 31, 2009 the ratio requirement decreases to 3.75 times.
 
Barnes Group Inc. / 2
 
We have not yet seen the sustained signs of a turnaround in the global economy.  The challenges posed in the third quarter were similar to what we have seen for the preceding six months in many of our end markets. However, we are optimistic about the prospects for economic improvement in 2010, so we continue to pursue internal initiatives we feel are essential to positioning Barnes Group for the future, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. During the quarter we strengthened our balance sheet through substantial debt reductions driven by working capital improvements and made strategic investments in people and processes to maximize our competitive position for sustainable long-term growth.
We are confident that we have positioned Barnes Group well to participate fully in a market recovery as conditions normalize.  We are encouraged by the stabilizing trends we are seeing in our transportation and industrial manufacturing businesses and optimistic for an anticipated rebound in aerospace activity in the second half of 2010.  We are committed to strengthening our capital structure, pursuing strategic revenue growth, and controlling costs as we navigate near-term economic challenges to maximize the value we bring to our customers and stockholders, Milzcik added.

On December 11, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") appointed Ms. Marian Acker to the position of Vice President, Controller, effective January 1, 2010. She will serve as the Company's principal accounting officer, replacing Mr. Francis C. Boyle, Jr., Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, in that capacity. Mr. Boyle will continue with the Company until his previously announced retirement on February 28, 2010. Ms. Acker is 47 years old. She joined the Company in 1993 and has held various positions of increasing responsibility in the Company's finance group since she joined the Company.
Effective January 1, 2010, Ms. Acker will receive an annual allowance of $20,000 for costs associated with car, car expenses, any club memberships, cell phones and PDAs. She will continue to participate in the Company's Management Incentive Compensation Plan. Her target incentive for 2010 will be 35% of salary and her maximum payout for 2010 will be 105% of salary, based on corporate results to be set by the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board. Ms. Acker's salary will continue at an annual rate of $220,000. Her salary level will be reviewed on or about February 8, 2010 when the Committee is expected to consider salary actions for the executive officers. In addition, on or about February 8, 2010 when the Committee is expected to consider stock grants to other employees of the Company, Ms. Acker will, subject to her continued employment, be granted under the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the "Stock Plan") a long-term incentive grant with an approximate aggregate "calculated value" of $50,000, as follows:
-        50% ($25,000) of the aggregate calculated value will be granted in the form of performance-vested restricted stock units for the performance period January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012, that will be payable annually between February 1st and March 15th of each year, beginning in 2011, subject to achieving pre-set goals to be set by the Committee,
-        50% ($25,000) of the aggregate calculated value will be granted in the form of time-vested restricted stock units that will vest ratably 18, 30 and 42 months after the grant date.
Dividend equivalents will be payable on both the performance-vested restricted stock units and the time-vested restricted stock units. The dividend equivalents will be determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Company's common stock.
Ms. Acker will participate in all other benefit plans and perquisites which the Company makes available to its officers from time to time, on a basis commensurate with her position, including retirement benefits to be provided under the Company's Salaried Retirement Income Plan, the Retirement Benefits Equalization Plan, and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Ms. Acker will also participate in the Company's Senior Executive Enhanced Life Insurance Program (the "SEELIP"). The Company will pay the premiums on the SEELIP. The insurance policy will be owned by Ms. Acker and will have a death benefit equal to four times her salary. The Company will gross up Ms. Acker for any income tax attributable to the premiums paid by the Company in accordance with the SEELIP.
In connection with her appointment, the Board also authorized a severance (change in control) agreement with Ms. Acker on substantially the same terms generally entered into between the Company and its executive officers. In addition, the Board authorized entering into an incentive compensation reimbursement agreement with Ms. Acker.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Compensation Committee Actions
On February 8, 2010, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company took the following actions with respect to current executive officers of the Company who were "named executive officers" in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 8, 2009 and the Company's Chief Financial Officer:
 
Each of the awards described below was made pursuant to, and is governed by, the terms of the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan, which has been approved by the Company's stockholders.
 
 
Restricted Stock Units
Each restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive, without payment to the Company, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock"), equal to the number of restricted stock units that become vested and to receive dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units by the dividend per share paid on the Common Stock. The restricted stock units vest 33.34% on February 8, 2011 and 33.33% on each of February 8, 2012 and February 8, 2013.
 
The restricted stock units become non-forfeitable in the event the holder retires on or after February 8, 2011; provided that the holder is at least 62 years old and has at least five years of service (a "Qualified Retirement") and executes a covenant not to compete and release of claims.
The restricted stock units will be accelerated and become payable upon termination of the holder due to the holder's death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the holder's termination for any other reason, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be forfeited.
Performance Unit Awards
Under the performance unit awards the executives have the right to receive a cash payment per unit awarded upon the achievement of basic earnings per share goals established by the Committee. The performance unit awards are to be earned as follows: 33.34% for fiscal year 2010 and 33.33% for each of fiscal years 2011 and 2012. In the event of a change in control of the Company, all of the performance unit awards shall be deemed to be earned.
In the event of a voluntary termination, involuntary termination with or without cause or a Qualified Retirement, the holder shall forfeit all unearned performance unit awards. In the event of termination due to death or disability, any performance unit awards earned in the year of such termination shall be paid and the reminder shall be forfeited.
On or about March 1 of each year following the year in which the performance unit awards are earned, a specified dollar amount equal to the number of earned units multiplied by the per share fair market value of the Common Stock on the date preceding the payment date will be delivered to the officers.
Stock Options
All of the stock options granted to Messrs. Milzcik, Stephens and Dempsey shall vest at the rate of 33.34% on August 8, 2011 and 33.33% on each of August 8, 2012 and August 8, 2013. The exercise price of each stock option is $15.265, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, determined in accordance with the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan.
In the event of a termination due to death, disability or a change in control of the Company, the stock options will become exercisable in full. In the event of a death or disability termination, the stock options may be exercised within one year of such termination.
In the event of an involuntary termination without cause, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options. In the event of an involuntary termination for cause all stock options are forfeited. In the event of a voluntary termination, unvested stock options shall be forfeited and vested options shall terminate as of the last day of employment.
In the event of a Qualified Retirement on or after February 8, 2011, so long as the holder executes a covenant not to compete, stock options shall continue to vest as scheduled. If the holder does not execute such covenant, unvested stock options shall be forfeited. If the holder also executes a release of claims, the holder shall have five years from the retirement date to exercise vested stock options. If the holder does not execute such release, the holder shall have one year to exercise vested stock options.
Action Regarding Outstanding Long-Term Incentive Grants
Performance share awards
With respect to outstanding performance share awards granted to each of Messrs. Milzcik, Dempsey and Boyle in 2007 and Messrs. Milzcik and Boyle in 2008 to be earned in 2009 upon attainment of targeted basic earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that the target was not met. Therefore, there were no payouts for 2009.
 
The Compensation Committee set the performance goals for basic earnings per share for 2010 performance for performance share awards to be paid out, upon attainment of earnings per share levels, in the first quarter of 2011. In setting a threshold target the Compensation Committee waived a minimum threshold amount requirement of $1.38 provided for in the performance share agreement for all executive officers other than Mr. Milzcik and modified Mr. Milzcik's agreement to lower each of the performance goals (which had been established for Mr. Milzcik in 2008) to align them with those applicable to other executive officers.
Performance unit awards
With respect to outstanding performance unit awards granted to each of Messrs. Milzcik, Stephens, Boyle and Dempsey in 2009 to be earned in 2009 upon attainment of targeted basic earnings per share levels, the Compensation Committee determined that the target was not met. Therefore, there were no payouts for 2009.
The Compensation Committee set the performance goals for basic earnings per share for 2010 performance for performance units to be paid in the first quarter of 2011.
 
The following salaries are effective April 1, 2010.
 
Mr. Boyle is retiring at the end of February 2010 and therefore did not receive a salary increase.
 
The Compensation Committee granted the following cash bonuses pursuant to the Company's Performance-Linked Bonus Plan for Selected Executive Officers ("PLBP") in the case of Messrs. Milzcik, Stephens and Dempsey and the Management Incentive Compensation Plan, in the case of Mr. Boyle. The awards were based, in the case of Messrs.

The Compensation Committee also established performance goals for 2010 under the PLBP regarding: (a) basic earnings per share of the Company; (b) PPAT of each of the Company's segments (Logistics and Manufacturing Services and Precision Components); and (c) the level of revenues of the Company and each of the segments. 85% of each executive's annual incentive award opportunity is based on basic earnings per share of the Company and 15% is based on the Company's revenues. For the leaders of the business segments, each of the executive's annual incentive award opportunity is based on a combination of corporate and segment performance with (i) 40% of the incentive award opportunity based on (using an 85%/15% split) basic earnings per share of the Company and corporate revenues, and (ii) 60% based on (also using an 85%/15% split) PPAT and revenues of the applicable segment taking into account the performance of the business units in the applicable segment.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009.  The Company reported income from continuing operations of $6.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $5.5 million, or negative $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Included in the fourth quarter 2009 results are $1.3 million after-tax of severance and plant consolidation charges as compared to $14.3 million for severance and plant consolidation charges and a provision for deferred tax assets taken in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Barnes Groups fourth quarter 2009 sales totaled $256.5 million, down 3 percent from $265.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
BRISTOL, Conn., February 18, 2010
For the full year 2009, Barnes Group achieved sales of $1.0 billion, down 24 percent from 2008.  Income from continuing operations for the full year 2009 was $39.0 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.72, compared to income from continuing operations in 2008 of $92.7 million or $1.66 per diluted share.
Barnes Group generated $143.5 million in cash from operations for the 12 months of 2009, reflecting an improvement of 28 percent over the prior year period level of $111.8 million.  Cash flow generation, driven by significant working capital reductions, helped reduce debt to $351.5 million, a decline of 25 percent from year-end 2008.  As a result, the Companys debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2009 improved to 34 percent.  The Companys December 31, 2009 total debt covenant ratio of 3.10 times was below 3.75 times, the level required under the Companys revolving credit agreement.
Reflecting on our year-long focus on cost control and cash management, I am extremely proud of our accomplishments.  We were able to strengthen our balance sheet through effective working capital management and debt reduction.  Rigorous cost control, working capital reductions, and alignment of capital spending with anticipated demand helped us generate cash well beyond our goals during this difficult year, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.
Our 2009 results were affected most by the decline in our revenues due to the global economic downturns impact on our end markets.  We believe the steps we took to deal with the recession have effectively adjusted our cost structure to enhance our profitability at lower volumes and provide incremental profits on revenue gains.  Throughout 2010, we will continue to focus on maintaining our financial discipline, as we shift the Companys attention toward profitable sales growth.  Our efforts will

enable us to successfully transition from the depressed market conditions of 2009 to more favorable conditions this year and further growth in 2011, Milzcik added.

 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported financial results for the second quarter 2010.  The Company reported net income of $14.8 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $10.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.  Barnes Groups second quarter 2010 sales totaled $281.9 million, an increase of 10.5 percent from $255.2 million in the second quarter of 2009.
BRISTOL, Conn., August 2, 2010
 
 
We continue to benefit from improved economic conditions, particularly within our industrial and automotive manufacturing businesses, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc.  Double-digit sales growth coupled with a continued focus on an efficient cost structure through lean initiatives has provided a 67 percent improvement to our operating profit this quarter.
Economic growth, along with a continuation of strong order rates, should allow us to build upon our success, said Milzcik.  However, we continue to remain cautious.  While the level of activity within our distribution and aerospace aftermarket businesses improves, the rate of growth is slow.  As a result, our outlook for the full year 2010 remains the same with full year diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $1.10, based on current and anticipated market conditions.

 Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2010.  The Company reported net income of $15.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $10.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.  Barnes Groups third quarter 2010 sales totaled $289.9 million, an increase of 11.4 percent from $260.3 million in the third quarter of 2009.
BRISTOL, Conn., October 29, 2010
 
 
Continued improvements in the current economic climate, particularly within our industrial and automotive end markets, led to double-digit sales growth for the second consecutive quarter, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes Group Inc. This increase in sales, paired with our continued focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure and productivity, contributed to a meaningful improvement to our third quarter operating profit.
We also experienced continued growth in our backlog and strong order rates, which position us well to build upon our success as we move into the fourth quarter, Milzcik said.  While we are seeing strong growth in Precision Components and increased activity within our distribution and aerospace aftermarket businesses, we continue to remain cautious. Our 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance has been tightened to $0.95 to $1.00 given current and anticipated market conditions.

The CMDC also approved changes to the Company's Senior Executive Enhanced Life Insurance Program, which include (1) closing participation in the program to any employee hired or promoted into an eligible position after April 1, 2011 and (2) eliminating Company-paid premium and related tax gross-up payments following retirement after April 1, 2011, except that the current program will be maintained during retirement for current employees who have attained or will attain age 62 with 10 years of service on or before December 31, 2011.
Long-Term Relative Measure Incentive Program
On February 8, 2011, the CMDC also approved a new long-term Relative Measure Program (the "Program") with respect to Performance Share Awards issued under the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the "Equity Plan"). The Program is designed to assess long-term Company performance relative to the performance of companies included in the Russell 2000 Index, measured over a three-year performance period commencing January 1, 2011 ("Performance Period"). Unlike the previous program, which was based on annual basic earnings per share, the Program is based on the Company's total shareholder return, basic earnings per share growth and operating income before depreciation and amortization growth (weighted equally) as compared to the same measures for companies in the Russell 2000 Index over the Performance Period. Under the Program, participants may earn between 0% and 250% of the target award (determined independently for each measure), depending on the Company's percentile ranking within the Russell 2000 Index. If earned, the Performance Share Awards will be paid in shares of Company common stock.
If a participant voluntarily resigns from employment or the participant's employment is terminated by the Company for cause before the end of the Performance Period, the entire Performance Share Award will be forfeited. If a participant's employment is terminated due to death or disability, then a pro-rata portion of the award, based on the number of days the participant was employed during the Performance Period, will be paid following termination based on target. If (1) a participant terminates employment due to retirement (attainment of age 62 and five years of service) and the participant has been employed for at least two years of the Performance Period or (2) a participant's employment is terminated by the Company without cause, then a pro-rata portion of the award based on the number of days the participant was employed during the Performance Period, will be paid based on the Company's actual performance for the Performance Period. If a participant terminates employment due to retirement and has been employed for less than two years of the Performance Period, then a pro-rata portion of the award based on the number of days the participant was employed during the Performance Period will be paid based on the lesser of target or the Company's actual performance during the Performance Period.
If there is a Change in Control (as defined in the Equity Plan), the Performance Share Award under the Program will vest and accelerate only if a participant's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Named Executive Officer's Severance Agreement) ("double trigger") on or within two years following the Change in Control, except for Mr. Milzcik, for whom the terms of his employment agreement will control. In those cases, the unvested portion of the award will fully accelerate based on actual performance for completed years during the Performance Period and based on target for incomplete years remaining in the Performance Period.
 
On February 9, 2011, the CMDC approved awards under the Relative Measure Program. On that day, the CMDC also approved Option and Restricted Stock Unit awards under the Equity Plan for its employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Except for Mr. Milzcik, for whom the terms of his employment agreement control, Options and Restricted Stock Units granted to the Company's employees include double trigger vesting and will accelerate upon a Change in Control only if the participant's employment has been terminated by the Company without cause, by the participant for Good Reason, or on account of the participant's death, disability or retirement on or within two years following the Change in Control. Upon termination of employment due to retirement, death or disability, in the absence of a Change in Control, the Options and Restricted Stock Units will accelerate only if the participant has been employed for at least one year from the grant date in the case of Options and two years from the grant date in the case of Restricted Stock Units.
The following table summarizes the awards granted to the Company's Named Executive Officers (for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010) on February 9, 2011. Each of the awards described below was made pursuant to, and is governed by, the terms of the Equity Plan.
 
Item 5.03. Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Changes in Fiscal Year.
On February 9, 2011, the Board of Directors the Company (the "Board") amended and restated the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws solely for the purpose of amending the first sentence of Article III, Section 1 thereof to enable the Board to designate as corporate officers individuals who are not also determined by the Board to be "executive officers" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before the amendment the sentence read as follows:
"The officers of the Corporation shall be the President and any Vice President or other person determined by the Board of Directors to be an "executive officer" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."
As amended, the sentence now reads as follows:
"The officers of the Corporation shall be the President and any Vice President or other person designated by the Board of Directors as a corporate officer."
A copy of the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws (as of February 9, 2011) is attached to this report as Exhibit 3.1

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is a called for a date that is not within 30 days before

No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the Chairman of the Board of Directors or such other authorized representative of the Corporation presiding over an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or such other authorized representative shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
SECTION 1. General Powers.
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of the members thereof.
SECTION 2. Number, Classification, Term of Office, and Qualifications.
The number of directors to constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be nine, but such number may from time to time be increased, or diminished to not less than three, by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as may be, with the term of office of one class expiring each year.
 
At the annual meeting of stockholders in 1970, directors of the first class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting, directors of the second class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting and directors of the third class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting. At each annual meeting of stockholders after 1970, successors to the directors whose terms shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for terms expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting, except that any director elected to a directorship newly created since the last annual meeting shall hold office for the same term as the other directors of the class to which such director has been assigned. When the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so assigned among the classes by the Board of Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as may be. Each director shall continue in office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his death or until his resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided. No director need be a stockholder, nor a resident of the State of Delaware.
SECTION 3. Election of Directors.
At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes given at such election.
SECTION 4. Term of Office for Directors Elected to Newly Created Directorships.
In furtherance of Sections 2 and 9 of this Article II, any director elected to a directorship newly created since the last annual meeting shall be elected to serve the term of the class to which such director is assigned; provided, however that the stockholders of the Corporation shall be afforded the opportunity to ratify and approve the election of that director to the director's assigned class at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. If the election of the director is so ratified and approved, the director shall serve out the remainder of the director's term without further stockholder ratification or approval. Any director elected by stockholders to a directorship newly created at an annual meeting of stockholders at which such director is elected shall serve out the term of the class to which such director is assigned without further stockholder ratification or approval.
SECTION 5. Time of Meetings, Notices, etc.
There shall be an organizational meeting of the Board of Directors for the election of officers and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders or as soon as practicable thereafter upon the notice hereinafter provided for a special meeting of the Board of Directors. The directors may, however, without notice, hold the organizational meeting in the city where the annual meeting of stockholders is held and immediately following such annual meeting of stockholders. At the organizational meeting, the directors shall elect one of the directors as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may, but need not, be an officer or other employee of the Corporation. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, any other director selected by those directors attending the meeting, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
 
the President of the Company, shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may be removed as Chairman of the Board of Directors at any time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may provide by resolution for the holding of regular meetings and may fix the time of holding such meetings. Such regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or any three directors. Unless otherwise specified in the notice or waiver of notice thereof, each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the office of the Corporation in Bristol, Connecticut. Notice of each special meeting (a) shall be mailed to each director, addressed to the director at the director's residence or usual place of business, at least seven days before the day on which the meeting is to be held or (b) shall be sent to the director by telecopy (if confirmed) or shall be telephoned or delivered to the director personally, in any such case, not later than three days before the day on which the meeting is to be held, unless the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President determines that circumstances require that a meeting be held on shorter notice. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director, however, if waived by that director in writing. Any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given if all the directors shall be present thereat.
SECTION 6. Quorum and Manner of Acting.
A majority of the directors at the time in office (but not less than one-third of the number necessary to constitute the whole Board of Directors) at a meeting duly assembled shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 9 of this Article II. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present at any meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is available and present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given.
SECTION 7. Resignations.
Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
SECTION 8. Removal of Directors.
Any director may be removed at any time for cause, at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for the purposes of this Section 8 as one class.
 
SECTION 9. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.
Any vacancy occurring among the directors by death, resignation, removal or otherwise and any newly created directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or, in the event such directors are unable to act, by the stockholders. Each director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Each director elected to a newly created directorship shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders.
SECTION 10. Committees.
The Board of Directors, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, may appoint such committees of the Board of Directors as the Board of Directors may determine. Such committees shall have the powers delegated thereto by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors, each committee of the Board of Directors may fix its own rules of procedure and may meet at such place or places and at such time or times as the committee from time to time shall determine. Each such committee shall cause its proceedings to be recorded, and the minutes of committee meetings shall be distributed to the Board of Directors.
SECTION 1. Number, Appointment, Term of Office and Qualifications.
The officers of the Corporation shall be the President and any Vice President or other person designated by the Board of Directors "as a corporate officer". Each officer shall be appointed by the Board of Directors and shall hold office until a successor shall have been duly appointed and qualified or until death or until earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may be removed either with or without cause by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office at any meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present.
SECTION 2. The President and Vice Presidents.
The President, subject to the instructions of the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors, shall have general charge of the business, affairs and property of the Corporation and control over its several officers. The President shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned by the Board of Directors, or any committee of the Board of Directors. At the request of the President or, in his absence or disability, a Vice President designated by the President (or in the absence of such designation, a Vice President designated by the Board of Directors) shall perform all the duties of the President, and when so acting, that Vice President shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all restrictions upon, the President. Any Vice President shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to that Vice President or to Vice Presidents generally by the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors or the President.
SECTION 1. Reimbursement.
Each director and officer of the Corporation shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable expenses incurred in connection with his attention to the affairs of the
 
Corporation, including attendance at meetings. Each employee of the Corporation other than an officer shall be entitled to such reimbursement for that employee's reasonable expenses incurred in connection with his attention to the affairs of the Corporation in accordance with applicable policy of the Corporation or as the Board of Directors or any person designated by it may authorize.
SECTION 2. Indemnification.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certificates for stock of the Corporation shall be issued in the form and bear the signatures required by Delaware law and otherwise shall be as set forth in any applicable resolutions or other action of the Board of Directors. The Corporation and its transfer agents and registrars, if any, shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware. The Board of Directors may make any such policies, rules and regulations as it may deem expedient or advisable concerning the issuance, replacement, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, determined in accordance with applicable law, as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any meeting of stockholders or entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or distribution or to any allotment of rights or to exercise the rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed, and shall be subject to change, by the Board of Directors.
Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the power to amend, alter or repeal these By-Laws and adopt new By-Laws may be exercised by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.

In exchange for my continued employment through the Termination Date (as defined in the attached transition services and separation letter agreement dated as of June 14, 2011(the "Agreement") and the salary and benefits provided to me through such date as set forth in Section 1 of the Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated by reference in this release ("First Release"), I (and anyone acting on my behalf) agree to release every past and present right or claim of any kind, whether legal, equitable or otherwise, against Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company"), including, without limitation, any and all related entities, corporations, partnerships, subsidiaries, joint ventures and divisions of the Company. I give up such rights and claims against the Company, its employee benefit plans and anyone else related to the Company (such as, without limitation, the Company's present and former employees, officers, directors, stockholders, representatives, agents and insurers).
I agree that I executed this First Release on my own behalf and also on behalf of any heirs, agents, representatives, successors and assigns that I have now or may have in the future. These rights and claims include, but are not limited to, those that I may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits age discrimination in employment; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246, which prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex; the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on a handicap or disability; the Equal Pay Act, which prohibits paying men and women unequal pay for equal work; any claims under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar law, which requires, among other things, that advance notice be given of certain work force reductions; and all claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, such as claims relating to pension, profit sharing, or health plan benefits, except as noted in the following paragraph; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; all claims under any state Fair Employment Practices Act as well as any other federal, state or local laws or regulations; all claims for alleged physical or personal injury or emotional distress; and any other claims which could arise from employment or separation from employment, whether in express or implied contract (whether written or oral), or claims for breach of any covenant of good faith and fair dealing (express or implied), or in tort (including without limitation, defamation, assault, battery, false imprisonment, interference with contractual or advantageous business relationship, and invasion of privacy) or for wrongful or retaliatory discharge, whether based on common law or otherwise. The foregoing list is meant to be illustrative rather than inclusive. Nothing in this First Release shall prohibit me from filing a claim with, cooperating with, or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a state Fair Employment Practices Agency (although I acknowledge and agree that I shall not be able to recover any monetary benefits in connection with such claim or proceeding).
I keep any right, however, that I may have to (1) receive severance benefits under the Executive Separation Pay Plan; (2) elect health care coverage under the federal continuation of health coverage law known as "COBRA," or under any applicable state law concerning
 
continuation of health coverage, unless I am ineligible for such coverage under such law; (3) payments or distributions pursuant to any equity awards granted to me by the Company in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and equity award agreements; and (4) indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, any agreement between me and the Company, or the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policies.
This First Release covers both claims that I know about and those I may not know about.

I acknowledge that I have received twenty-one (21) calendar days to review this First Release from when it was first given to me. I acknowledge and agree that any changes made to this First Release before I sign it will not entitle me to an additional twenty-one (21) calendar days to review the new version of this First Release. I also understand that under no circumstances will Enhanced Severance be paid unless I sign this First Release and deliver it to the Company within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the Termination Date and do not revoke the First Release.

As a result of an organizational restructuring to enable the company's Aerospace OEM and Aftermarket businesses to implement a customer-focused go-to-market strategy, the position of President, Precision Components was eliminated effective May 20, 2011. Mr. Burris has been requested to provide transition services to the Company's executive officers through August 20, 2011.

Such representations and warranties of the Company would include, among others, warranties related to corporate matters, the financial condition of the BDE Business, the assignment to Berner of intellectual property rights necessary for Berner to conduct the BDE Business, the absence of significant undisclosed legal disputes which might affect the BDE Business, and the absence of notices from customers or suppliers that could impact the BDE Business.
The Offer was conditioned upon the receipt by Berner from the Company of a letter agreement dated and delivered to Berner on August 20, 2011 (the "Letter Agreement") in which the Company agreed: (i) until the revocation or termination of the Offer not to solicit or enter into any discussions, negotiations, or agreements other than with Berner in connection with a potential sale of the BDE Business or any part of it; and (ii) subject to Berner's compliance with specified terms of the Offer, to reimburse Berner for its costs and expenses incurred

Item 5.02.
    
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(c) Appointment of Principal Officers.
On February 8, 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") appointed Patrick J. Dempsey, 47, to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective February 13, 2012. Mr. Dempsey has held a series of roles of increasing responsibility since joining the Company in October 2000. In November 2004, he was promoted to Vice President, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Barnes Aerospace. In October 2007, he was appointed Vice President, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Barnes Distribution. In October 2008, he was appointed to his most recent position as Vice President, Barnes Group Inc. and President, Logistics and Manufacturing Services.
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Contingent on his appointment by the Company's Board of Directors on February 8, 2012, on February 7, 2012, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "CMDC") approved the following compensation actions with regard to Mr. Dempsey: (1) a base salary increase to $450,000 from $431,000, (2) a target percentage of 50% of base salary for purposes of the annual incentive compensation plan, which is unchanged from his target percentage before the appointment, and (3) a long-term equity grant value of $625,000. The approval of this long-term equity grant resulted in the CMDC making the following awards to Mr. Dempsey on February 8, 2012: an Option to purchase 13,000 shares of Company common stock, a grant of 7,100 Restricted Stock Units and a grant of 11,800 Performance Share Awards. A summary of the terms of these equity awards is included in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2011, and the forms of award agreements were filed as exhibits to the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2011. A slight modification of the terms of the Performance Share Awards is described below.
On February 7, 2012, the CMDC approved a special equity retention grant valued at $750,000 for Christopher J. Stephens, Jr., Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. This resulted in the CMDC making a special grant of 28,200 Restricted Stock Units to Mr. Stephens on February 8, 2012. The award will vest in three equal installments on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.
In addition, the CMDC took the following actions with respect to the Company's named executive officers (as defined in the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and who are currently employed by and have not provided notice of resignation to the Company (the "Named Executive Officers")).
The CMDC approved the target mix of equity awards for 2012 under the Barnes Group Inc. Stock and Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the "Equity Plan"), which has been approved by the Company's stockholders. For 2011, the target mix of equity awards issued under the Equity Plan consisted of one-third each of Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Awards under the Company's long-term Relative Measure Program (the "Program"). For 2012, the approved target mix under the Equity Plan is 20% Options, 30% Restricted Stock Units and 50% Performance Share Awards. A summary of material terms of these equity awards and the Program is included in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2011, and the forms of award agreements were filed as exhibits to the Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2011.
The CMDC also approved a slight modification to the form of Performance Share Award agreement to provide for a complete forfeiture of Performance Share Awards under the Program if the participant's employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause before the first anniversary of the Performance Share Award grant date. This change applies to Performance Share Awards under the Program granted in 2012 and later years. Before this amendment, if a participant's employment was involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause before the first anniversary of the grant date, then a pro-rata portion of the award based on the number of days
2
the participant was employed during the Performance Period would have been paid based on the Company's actual performance for the Performance Period.
On February 8, 2012, the CMDC approved annual equity awards of Options, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Awards under the Program for certain employees, in each case pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan and the relevant forms of award agreements. The following table summarizes the awards granted to the listed Named Executive Officers.
On February 8, 2012, the Board approved an amendment to the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), which provides certain supplemental pension benefits in the form of a monthly supplemental annuity. The approved amendment terminates participation in the SERP for all individuals who are not receiving benefits under the SERP or vested thereunder as of April 1, 2012.
The Board also approved an amendment to the Company's 2009 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("DC Plan") on February 8, 2012. The DC Plan provides participants with certain supplemental retirement benefits if the participant is vested at termination of employment. Vesting typically occurs upon the attainment of age 55 and 10 years of service. In general under the DC Plan, and subject to the the CMDC's determination, participants are credited with an annual hypothetical contribution equal to 20% of any base salary and annual incentive compensation above the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit (i.e., earnings taken into account for tax-qualified plan purposes, currently $250,000), and vested benefits are paid following termination of employment, which is typically in the form of five annual installments. The amendment approved by the Board closed participation to any employee hired, rehired or promoted into an eligible position on or after April 1, 2012.

BARNES GROUP INC. REPORTS
FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2011
FINANCIAL RESULTS
BRISTOL, Conn., February 17, 2012
- Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistics services company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. Fourth quarter 2011 sales totaled $283.3 million, up 9.7% from $258.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Income from continuing operations was $23.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share, up 86% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Barnes Group completed the sale of its Barnes Distribution Europe (BDE) businesses which were comprised of the Company's European KENT, Toolcom and BD France distribution businesses and reported within the Company's Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment. The financial results of BDE, including the loss on sale for the periods presented, have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations for reporting purposes. For the year, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $26.9 million, or ($0.48) per diluted share. The loss on sale of $26.1 million includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $16.8 million.
For the full year 2011, Barnes Group generated sales of $1,169 million, up 13.7%. Income from continuing operations was $91.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $54.0 million, or $0.96 per diluted share in 2010.
Barnes Group's fourth quarter results cap a strong year of performance for our Company, said Gregory F. Milzcik, Barnes Group Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer. We generated solid organic growth with meaningful margin flow-through leading to an expansion in operating margins to 10.9%, up 250 basis points for the year. Coupled with our continuing focus on profitable growth and improved productivity, we delivered a 70% increase in income from continuing operations for 2011. In addition, we exit 2011 having achieved strong fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, and a healthy backlog of $582 million, up 21% from 2010.

2012 Outlook
During 2011, we experienced improving conditions across our end-markets and generated a double-digit increase in both orders and backlog. We expect our positive momentum to continue into 2012, especially with the strength in the global commercial aerospace industry. Further, with the sale of BDE, a greater level of management's attention can be directed toward expanding our operations both organically and through acquisitions, bringing new products and processes to market and growing our geographic reach, added Milzcik.
Barnes Group Inc. expects 2012 revenue to grow 6% to 9% from 2011 and forecasts operating margins of approximately 12%. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share are forecasted to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.93, up 9% to 18% from 2011.
Our improved financial performance and generally favorable end-markets will allow us to invest further in our businesses. For 2012, we expect capital expenditures to increase to a range of $45 to $50 million and cash conversion of greater than 90%, said Christopher J. Stephens, Jr., Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.

); provided, however, that Section 3.12(a) does not identify any International Plan (i) the existence of which is required by applicable Law, or (ii) which is an employment, retention, severance, consulting or similar agreement with any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that provides for total annual compensation that is not in excess of $200,000. All ERISA Plans and Non-ERISA Plans (collectively, 
Benefit Plans
) are being maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with all Laws applicable to such plans and the terms and conditions of the respective plan documents. The Internal Revenue Service (the 
IRS
) has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each ERISA Plan (or, in the case of an ERISA Plan that is based upon a prototype plan, an opinion letter with respect to the underlying pre-approved plan) that is intended to be a qualified plan within the meaning of 401(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of such ERISA Plan. No ERISA Plan is subject to Title IV or 302 of ERISA or 412 of the Code and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no liability with respect to any such employee benefit plan or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on behalf of any such employee benefit plan. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV or 302 of ERISA or 412 of the Code.

COBRA
), no Benefit Plan provides life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to current or former employees, officers or directors or beneficiaries or dependents thereof after termination of employment. The Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material respects with the requirements of COBRA.

No actions, suits, claims or proceedings with respect to the assets of any Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by or before any Authority. No fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) that is the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Person that is a fiduciary of any ERISA Plan, has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the investment or administration of the assets of any ERISA Plan (including any liability under an indemnification agreement) which is reasonably likely to result in a material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
(e)    Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies each Benefit Plan that:
(i) is
maintained in whole or in part outside the United States; (ii) is subject to Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or a political subdivision thereof; or (iii) is maintained for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens (an

6.05.    
Confidentiality
. Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby have been consummated, the Purchaser will, and will ensure that its representatives and other agents will, hold in strict confidence and not use in any way except in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, all confidential information obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby from the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Sellers or any of their respective representatives, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.05

Exclusive Dealing.
During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company, each Seller and the Seller Representative shall not take, nor shall they permit any of their Affiliates, officers, directors, executive employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, or in the case of providing information or negotiating on Purchasers behalf, officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and other agents) concerning any purchase of any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries equity securities or any merger, sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business or similar transaction involving or relating to any Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than the exercise of outstanding options and other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business (each such transaction, an Acquisition Transaction), and the Company, each Seller and the Seller Representative, and their Affiliates, officers, directors, executive employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other agents, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and other communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any such Acquisition Transaction.

6.07.    
Notice of Developments.
If the Company or the Sellers become aware prior to Closing of any event, fact or condition or nonoccurrence of any event, fact or condition that may constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or the Sellers or may constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Sellers if such representation or warranty were made on the date of the occurrence or discovery of such event, fact or condition or on the Closing Date, then the Company or the Seller Representative will promptly provide the Purchaser with a written description of such fact or condition. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company and the Seller Representative shall have the continuing obligation to promptly supplement the information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Sellers Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered, which, if in existence on the date hereof and known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. Neither the supplementation of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the obligation in this
Section 6.07
nor any disclosure after the date hereof of the untruth of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement shall operate as a cure of the failure to disclose the information, or a cure of the breach of any representation or warranty made herein, but such supplementation or disclosure shall not give Purchaser the right to terminate this Agreement unless the subject matter with respect thereto would reasonably be expected to result in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in
Sections 7.01(a)
or
7.01(c)
; and determination of any liability for breach of representations or warranties either at signing or at Closing shall be made without reference to any supplements and with reference only to the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule as they stand on the date of this Agreement;
provided
, that if Purchaser determines to consummate the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby and not terminate this Agreement following supplementation or disclosure of a fact, event, circumstance or condition (or the nonexistence thereof) that has resulted in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in
Sections 7.01(a)
or
7.01(c)
, then the Sellers shall have no indemnification or contribution obligations with respect to such fact, event, circumstance or condition (or the nonexistence thereof), whether under this Agreement or otherwise.
6.08.    
Section 280G
. Prior to the Closing Date, (a) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a written waiver from each disqualified individual (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) who is entitled to receive payments or other benefits that may constitute parachute payments for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of his or her right to such payments or other benefits to the extent that they exceed one dollar less than three times such individuals base amount, as defined in Section 280g(b)(3)(a) of the Code, if such payments or other benefits are not approved by the Stockholders as described in clause (b) below (the 
280G Waivers
), and (b) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite Stockholder approval of any and all such payments and other benefits such that, upon obtaining such Stockholder approval, such payments and other benefits will not constitute parachute payments for purposes of  Section 280G of the Code (the 
280G Approval
)
.
  The form of waiver and solicitation materials, including all disclosure materials related thereto, shall be prepared by the Company and approved by Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
6.09.    
Additional Stockholders
. From and after the date hereof, the Company and the Seller Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Stockholders of
37
    
the Company who are not a party hereto (each, an 
Additional Stockholder
), to execute as soon as practicable after the date hereof a joinder to this Agreement agreeing to all of the terms hereof applicable to a Seller hereunder, other than with respect to obligations set forth in
Section 8.08
and
Section 8.09
, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit E
(the 
Additional Stockholder Joinder
). Within two (2) Business Days after the date hereof, the Seller Representative shall exercise its rights as the Drag-Along Seller (as defined in the Securityholders Agreement) under the terms of the Securityholders Agreement to (i) require that 100% of the Common Stock owned by the Additional Stockholders be sold to the Purchaser on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cause such Additional Stockholders to execute and deliver the Additional Stockholder Joinder, and upon such execution and delivery thereof such Additional Stockholder shall constitute a Seller for all purposes hereunder, with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Seller herein.  The Seller Representative shall take all actions required of the Drag-Along Seller under the terms of the Securityholders Agreement in connection with the Drag-Along Right (as defined in the Securityholders Agreement) and shall promptly provide the Purchaser notice of any material objections raised by any such Additional Stockholder. The execution and delivery of such Additional Stockholder Joinder shall not require the consent of the Purchaser any other Seller hereunder.  The rights and obligations of each Seller hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any Additional Stockholder as a party to this Agreement. In furtherance of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.09
, the Seller Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts to pursue through litigation a remedy, including injunctive relief, to cause the Additional Stockholders to fully comply with their respective obligations under the Securityholders Agreement and shall keep the Purchaser reasonably and promptly apprised of any material developments relating thereto.

(c)    The obligations of the Purchaser under this
Section 8.04

Covered Employees
) with: (i) base pay at a rate that is not less than the rate applicable immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) other compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements (except for defined benefit plans and equity compensation) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate,
as
those provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. It is expressly acknowledged that the obligations of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries under their respective Benefit Plans will continue as obligations of the Company and/or the applicable Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date, and the Sellers shall have no continuing liability with respect thereto;

provided
, that in no event shall such service crediting result in a duplication of benefits and in no event shall such service be credited for the purposes of benefit accrual under a U.S. defined benefit pension plan. For the avoidance of doubt, all severance or termination liabilities that arise as a result of a termination or constructive termination of an employee of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary triggered solely as a result of the Transaction (
i.e.
, any severance payable to an employee who has an immediate walk right upon the Closing of the Transaction, without any other condition) shall be deemed a Company Transaction Expense;
provided
,
however
, that any severance or termination liabilities arising from a termination or constructive termination resulting from any action taken by the Purchaser and its Affiliates on or following the Closing Date shall not be deemed a Company Transaction Expense.
(c)    After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any medical or dental benefit plans of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such limitations, waiting periods or physical examinations were met, not required to be met, or waived under the analogous Benefit Plans, and any deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles and co-pays under the health plans of the Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent such deductibles and co-pays were credited under analogous Benefit Plans.

(e)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Section 8.05
shall create any third party beneficiary right in any Person, and no provision in this Agreement shall create any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the Purchaser, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this
Section 8.05
or any other provision of this Agreement: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan or program, agreement; or (ii) limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program or agreement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

Section 8.05
creates an obligation for the Purchaser to continue to employ any Person.
8.06.    
Agreements Relating to Taxes
.
(a)    From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (severally, but not jointly, as set forth in
Article IX
) indemnify the Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates harmless from and against any Loss attributable to Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (each such taxable period shall be referred to as a 
Pre-Closing Tax Period
) including, for this purpose, any Taxes that would be payable by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period but for deductions that were taken into account in the calculation of the Income Tax Benefit Amount, to the extent such Taxes and Losses exceed the amount, if any, taken into account in determining Closing Net Working Capital and provided that any rights for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 8.06(a)
shall survive for 4 years after the Closing Date and any indemnification (other than, in the case of such indemnification, with respect to income Taxes payable in respect of income recognized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period from January 1, 2012 to the Closing Date) shall be subject to the limitation of
Section 9.02(b)(iii)
.
(b)    In order to apportion any Taxes relating to any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, services or transactions (including, income, sales, use, transfer, withholding, payroll and other employment Taxes) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of any other Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period.
44
    
(c)    All Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of Tax refunds) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or credit (net of any expenses, including Taxes attributable to such refund or credit) within 30 days after receipt or entitlement thereto; provided, that Sellers shall not be entitled to any such refund or credit to the extent (i) such refund or credit was taken into account in determining Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) such refund or credit is attributable to the carryback of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries from a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, or (iii) such refund or credit is received after 4 years from the Closing Date.
(d)    For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries filed after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed (except as otherwise required by Law, in a manner consistent with past practices) with the appropriate taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed; provided, however, that Purchaser shall (i) provide such Tax Returns to the Seller Representative for its review and comment 30 days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns in the case of income Tax Returns and 10 days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns as in the case of all other Tax Returns and (ii) accept and incorporate in such Tax Returns all reasonable comments made by the Seller Representative;
provided further
, that with respect to any income Tax Returns of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2011 that are not filed as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not be required to provide such income Tax Returns to the Seller Representative for its review and comment any earlier than 14 days prior to the filing of such income Tax Returns.
(e)    
Tax Claims
.
(i)    If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
Section 8.06(a)
then the Purchaser shall give notice to the indemnifying party in writing of such claim and of any counterclaim the Purchaser proposes to assert (a 
Tax Claim
); provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Sellers have been prejudiced as a result of such failure;
(ii)    With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) for which the Seller Representative has acknowledged in writing the indemnification obligations of the Sellers for any Taxes ultimately found to be owing with respect thereto, Sellers may elect to control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that the Purchaser, and counsel of its own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if it reasonably determines that such Tax Claim could have an
45
    
adverse impact on the Taxes of the Purchaser, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date; and
(iii)    The Sellers and the Purchaser shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, and shall bear their own respective costs and expenses. Neither the Sellers nor the Purchasers shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(f)    The Seller Representative, the Company, each of Companys Subsidiaries and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.
(g)    The Purchaser shall not amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the written consent of the Seller Representative, if such amendment could result in an increase in any indemnification obligation of the Sellers pursuant to
Section 8.06(a)
or
Section 9.02
.
(h)    For purposes of this
Section 8.06
, the Sellers indemnification obligations with respect to Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Sellers entitlement to Tax refunds (or credit in lieu of Tax refunds) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be calculated without regard to deductions to be taken into account in the computation of the Income Tax Benefit Amount.
8.07.    
Confidentiality
. Each Seller agrees not to disclose or use any Confidential Information, except that if and as long as a Seller is an employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries such Seller may use the Confidential Information in the ordinary course of his employment on behalf of the Company or such Company Subsidiary so long as such use is in compliance with all policies and agreements applicable to such Seller. Upon termination of such employment, each Seller will deliver promptly to Purchaser or destroy, at the request and option of Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information that are in his possession. In the event that any Seller is requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigation demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will notify Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 8.07
. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;
provided
,
however
, that the disclosing Seller shall use such Sellers reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the request of Purchaser, an order or other assurance that
46
    
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Purchaser shall designate. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information that is (i) generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of disclosure unless such Confidential Information is so available due to the actions of a Seller, or (ii) included in materials prepared by Seller Representatives Parent and its Affiliates, or the Other Institutional Sellers and their respective Affiliates, for delivery to investors and prospective investors.
8.08.    
Covenant Not to Compete
. During the Restricted Period, each of the Seller Representative, the Seller Representatives Parent and each of the Restrictive Covenant Individual Parties will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner (whether on such Sellers or Seller Representatives Parents own account, or as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent or otherwise), anywhere in the Applicable Area, engage directly or indirectly in the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date, or own any interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent, representative or otherwise), or consult with or render services for any Person that is engaged in the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date;
provided
,
however
, that no owner of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation shall be deemed to be engaged in the Business solely by reason of such publicly traded corporations engagement in its business.
8.09.    
Covenant Not to Solicit
. During the Restricted Period, each of the Seller Representative, the Seller Representatives Parent and each of the Restrictive Covenant Individual Parties will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner (whether on such Sellers or Seller Representatives Parents own account, as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent or otherwise), (a) call upon, solicit or provide services to any Customer with the intent of selling or attempting to sell any products or services similar to those offered by the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date, (b) hire or engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or engage or enter into any business relationship with any Person employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or induce or attempt to induce any Person to leave such employment (
provided
, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any Person outside the Restrictive Covenant Individual Parties
who responds to a general advertisement for employment), (c) make any negative or disparaging statements or communications regarding the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their operations, officers, directors or investors to any employee, network, Customer, sales representative, broker, supplier, licensee or other business relation (or any prospective customer, supplier, licensee or other business relationship) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (d) recommend any senior executive of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
8.10.    
Enforcement
. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of
Section 8.08
or
Section 8.09
is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closer to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after
47
    
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. In the event of litigation involving
Section 8.08
or
Section 8.09
, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The existence of any claim or cause of action by any Seller against the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Affiliates, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Purchaser of the provisions of
Section 8.08
or
Section 8.09
, which Section will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by the Purchaser or the Company.
8.11.    
Release
. If and only if the Closing occurs, each Seller and the Seller Representatives Parent, for itself, and its heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the

Released Claims
), and hereby irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any suit, action, or proceeding of any kind, in any court or before any tribunal, against any Released Party based upon any Released Claim. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this
Section 8.11
, Released Claims does not include, and the provisions of this
Section 8.11
shall not release or otherwise diminish, (a) the obligations of any Party set forth in or arising under any provisions of this Agreement or the agreements contemplated in connection herewith, (b) if such Seller is an employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in respect of (i) the current years accrued but unpaid compensation and (ii) such employees outstanding benefits under the benefit plans of the Company as of the Closing Date, and (c) the rights of any Person under the D&O Tail Insurance Policy.

Procedures for Third-Party Claims
.
(a)    Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX
in respect of any claim by any third party (each a 
Third-Party Claim
) shall give the Indemnifying
50
    
Party from whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought (i) prompt written notice (but in no event more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party acquires knowledge thereof) of such Third-Party Claim and (ii) copies of all documents and information received with respect to such Third-Party Claim within ten (10) days of their being obtained by the Indemnified Party;
provided
, that the failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify or provide copies to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party for any liability hereunder except to the extent that such failure shall have materially and actually prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
(b)    The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, and expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim with respect to which it is the Indemnifying Party and to be represented by counsel of its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party is contesting or defending the same with reasonable diligence and in good faith or (ii) the third party claim involves only money damages and does not seek a material injunction or other equitable relief;
provided
, that the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense;
provided
further
, that the Indemnifying Party may not enter into a settlement of any such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or involves other matters not binding upon the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of the claim hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof or if the Indemnifying Party is not or is no longer entitled to assume the defense thereof pursuant to this
Section 9.05(b)
, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, subject at all times to the Indemnified Partys obligations under
Section 9.06
hereof, to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all material developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the claim.
9.06.    
Mitigation
. Each Indemnified Party must take and must cause their respective Affiliates to take commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the Losses to the extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses, including without limitation at the Indemnifying Partys reasonable request and at the cost of the Indemnifying Party using commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and obtain recoveries from third parties other than the Indemnifying Party hereunder (including, without limitation, any insurance company or other insurance provider) who are legally responsible to reimburse such Indemnified Party for any Losses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Losses of any Person under this
Article IX
shall be net of the amount, if any, received by the Indemnified Party from any third party less any costs incurred in pursuing such claims not reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, including without limitation, any insurance company or other insurance provider, and shall be net of the amount of any Tax benefit, in each case in respect of or attributable to the Losses suffered thereby (each, a 
Third Party Reimbursement
). If, after receipt by the Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder, such Indemnified
51
    
Party receives a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses for which indemnification was made and such Third Party Reimbursement was not taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification, then the Indemnified Party shall turn over all of such Third Party Reimbursement to the Indemnifying Party less any costs not reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as set forth above up to the amount of the indemnification paid pursuant hereto. In addition, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain, following the Closing, insurance coverage reasonably appropriate to its business activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 9.06
shall not apply to proceeds recoverable by the Indemnified Parties under any insurance policy that is purchased by the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to cover breaches or liabilities arising under this Agreement.
9.07.    
Tax Treatment of Indemnification
. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article IX
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.
9.08.    
No Duplication of Recovery; Losses
. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. For purposes of this
Article IX
, 
Losses
 shall mean all losses, liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) actually incurred or paid by an Indemnified Party, net of (i) any insurance proceeds which such Indemnified Party has received relating to such Loss (net of any costs associated with obtaining recovery from the related insurer) and (ii) any Tax benefits which such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates has realized (by way of a Tax refund or an actual reduction in cash Taxes otherwise payable, in the case of the Purchaser, as certified by its Vice President-Taxes) as a result of the facts giving rise to such Loss;
provided
, Losses shall not include any loss, liability, damage or expense to the extent relating directly or indirectly to any item included in the computation of Closing Net Working Capital (all of which such losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, to the extent then known, shall be addressed and resolved exclusively in accordance with
Section 2.07
);
provided further
, that, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of fraud, Losses shall not include (other than with respect to Third Party Claims), and no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement, for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.
9.09.    
Exclusive Remedy After the Closing
. OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED IN THIS
ARTICLE IX

52
    
9.10.    
Other Indemnification Matters
. For purposes of determining whether there has been any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms material, materiality, in all material respects, Material Adverse Effect or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining the amount of Losses under this
Article IX
, the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them.
ARTICLE X
TERMINATION
10.01.    
Termination
. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:
(a)    by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative;
(b)    by the Purchaser by giving written notice to the Seller Representative at any time (i) if the Sellers or the Company has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement in a manner that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Purchaser has notified the Seller Representative of the breach and the breach has continued uncured for a period of 15 days after the notice of breach or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2012 (the 
Initial Outside Date
) by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
Section 7.01

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On August 27, 2012, Barnes Group Inc. (the Company) completed the acquisition of Synventive Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation (Synventive) pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 16, 2012 among the Company, Synventive, the stock and option holders of Synventive, and Cetus Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Seller Representative (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"). Together with its subsidiaries, Synventive, which is headquartered in Peabody, Massachusetts, is a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered and customized hot runner systems and components and provides related services.
Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Synventive for total consideration of approximately $341 million in cash, net of cash acquired, including estimated adjustments for Synventive's working capital and certain transaction related tax benefits.
The Company used borrowings under its bank credit facility, as discussed below in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to cash on hand to fund the acquisition. Additional information and details regarding the Company's acquisition of Synventive were previously disclosed in Item 1.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 17, 2012, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stock Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 17, 2012, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On August 24, 2012, to fund a portion of the acquisition of Synventive described under Item 2.01 above, the Company borrowed $309 million available under the Company's existing fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement"), with certain participating banks and financial institutions, including Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent for the lenders. 
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.10% to 1.70% depending on the Company's leverage ratio at the time of the borrowings.  The interest rate on the borrowings for the Synventive purchase was 1.50%.  Borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Company's debt agreements. As of June 30, 2012, the most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant in any agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, of not more than 3.25 times for the four fiscal quarters then ending. The Company's debt agreements also contain other financial covenants that require the maintenance of a certain other debt ratio, Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times and a certain interest coverage ratio, Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, of at least 4.25 times, at June 30, 2012. 
In connection with the July 10, 2012 exercise of the accordion feature under the Amended Credit Agreement increasing the total borrowing availability of the Company from $500 million to $750 million, the Company's lenders required that the Company's Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA did not exceed 3.5 times on the date of acquisition, including the borrowings to fund the acquisition and including the acquired EBITDA of Synventive over the prior four quarters.  On the acquisition date of August 27, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Amended Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

As permitted by Item 9.01(a)(4) of Form 8-K, the financial statements required by Item 9.01(a) of Form 8-K will be filed by amendment no later than 71 calendar days after the date this Current Report on Form 8-K is required to be filed.
(b) Pro forma financial information.

ARTICLE II
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SECTION 1. General Powers.
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of the members thereof.
SECTION 2. Number, Classification, Term of Office, and Qualifications.
The number of directors to constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be nine, but such number may from time to time be increased, or diminished to not less than three, by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as may be, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. At the annual meeting of stockholders in 1970, directors of the first class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting, directors of the second class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting and directors of the third class shall be
9
elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting. At each annual meeting of stockholders after 1970, successors to the directors whose terms shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for terms expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting, except that any director elected to a directorship newly created since the last annual meeting shall hold office for the same term as the other directors of the class to which such director has been assigned. When the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so assigned among the classes by the Board of Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as may be. Each director shall continue in office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his death or until his resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided. No director need be a stockholder, nor a resident of the State of Delaware.
SECTION 3. Election of Directors.
At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes given at such election.
SECTION 4. Term of Office for Directors Elected to Newly Created Directorships.
In furtherance of Sections 2 and 9 of this Article II, any director elected to a directorship newly created since the last annual meeting shall be elected to serve the term of the class to which such director is assigned; provided, however that the stockholders of the Corporation shall be afforded the opportunity to ratify and approve the election of that director to the director's assigned class at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. If the election of the director is so ratified and approved, the director shall serve out the remainder of the director's term without further stockholder ratification or approval. Any director elected by stockholders to a directorship newly created at an annual meeting of stockholders at which such director is elected shall serve out the term of the class to which such director is assigned without further stockholder ratification or approval.
SECTION 5. Time of Meetings, Notices, etc.
There shall be an organizational meeting of the Board of Directors for the election of officers and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders or as soon as practicable thereafter upon the notice hereinafter provided for a special meeting of the Board of Directors. The directors may, however, without notice, hold the organizational meeting in the city where the annual meeting of stockholders is held and immediately following such annual meeting of stockholders. At the organizational meeting, the directors shall elect one of the directors as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may, but need not, be an officer or other employee of the Corporation. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, any other director selected by those directors attending the meeting, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President of the Company, shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may be removed as Chairman of the Board of Directors at any time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may provide by resolution for the holding of regular meetings and may fix the time of holding such meetings. Such regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or any three directors. Unless otherwise specified in the notice or waiver of notice thereof, each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the office of
10
the Corporation in Bristol, Connecticut. Notice of each special meeting (a) shall be mailed to each director, addressed to the director at the director's residence or usual place of business, at least seven days before the day on which the meeting is to be held or (b) shall be sent to the director by telecopy (if confirmed) or shall be telephoned or delivered to the director personally, in any such case, not later than three days before the day on which the meeting is to be held, unless the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President determines that circumstances require that a meeting be held on shorter notice. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director, however, if waived by that director in writing. Any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given if all the directors shall be present thereat.
SECTION 6. Quorum and Manner of Acting.
A majority of the directors at the time in office (but not less than one-third of the number necessary to constitute the whole Board of Directors) at a meeting duly assembled shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 9 of this Article II. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present at any meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is available and present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given.
SECTION 7. Resignations.
Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
SECTION 8. Removal of Directors.
Any director may be removed at any time for cause, at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for the purposes of this Section 8 as one class.
SECTION 9. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.
Any vacancy occurring among the directors by death, resignation, removal or otherwise and any newly created directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or, in the event such directors are unable to act, by the stockholders. Each director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Each director elected to a newly created directorship shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders.
SECTION 10. Committees.
The Board of Directors, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, may appoint such committees of the Board of Directors as the Board of Directors may determine. Such committees shall have the powers delegated thereto by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided in a resolution of the Board of
11
Directors, each committee of the Board of Directors may fix its own rules of procedure and may meet at such place or places and at such time or times as the committee from time to time shall determine. Each such committee shall cause its proceedings to be recorded, and the minutes of committee meetings shall be distributed to the Board of Directors.
ARTICLE III

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BARNES GROUP INC.
ADOPTS WIDE-RANGING
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ENHANCEMENTS
Bristol, Connecticut, October 19, 2012 --
Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B) today announced that its Board of Directors has voted to recommend declassifying the Board so that all directors are elected annually, a change that must be approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2013 Annual Meeting. If the change is approved, beginning in 2014, directors whose terms are expiring will stand for election for one-year terms, with all directors being elected to one-year terms beginning in 2016. The Board also voted to recommend the elimination of supermajority voting requirements concerning the election, appointment and removal of directors. To become effective, the elimination of these supermajority requirements must also be approved by the stockholders at the 2013 Annual Meeting.
In addition, the Board amended its Corporate Governance Guidelines to add a majority voting policy under which any director who receives more withhold than for votes in an uncontested election must tender to the Board, for its consideration, an offer to resign. The Board further amended the Guidelines to provide for enhanced responsibilities for the lead independent director when the Chairman of the Board is not an independent director. The independent directors of the Board elected the Company's current presiding director, William J. Morgan, to serve as lead independent director, effective immediately. The amended Corporate Governance Guidelines are accessible on the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website, www.bginc.com.
The Board also amended the Company's By-Laws to permit shareholders holding at least 40% of the Company's common shares to call special meetings, as well as addressed certain technical matters, including matters
in response to recent Delaware court litigation unrelated to the Company.
Over the last several years, we have been engaged in a dialogue with our stockholders regarding the corporate governance structures for our Company. Today's announcement to implement wide-ranging corporate governance changes demonstrates the Board's commitment to enacting sound and responsive shareholder-focused corporate governance policies that our stockholders
have indicated they support, said Gary G. Benanav, Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee.
As part of our ongoing commitment to sound corporate governance, we will continue to evaluate our corporate governance practices, added Thomas O. Barnes, Chairman of the Board.

NEWS RELEASE
BARNES GROUP INC. REPORTS
THIRD QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
BRISTOL, Conn., October 26, 2012
- Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), an international aerospace and industrial manufacturing and service provider, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2012. Net sales increased 2 percent to $306.1 million from $298.6 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Sales growth included a 5 percent benefit from the Synventive acquisition, offset by a 1 percent decrease in organic sales and 2 percent from unfavorable foreign exchange.
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was down 17 percent to $20.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, from $24.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, a year earlier. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter included $5.1 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share, of short-term purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these acquisition related items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.44. A table highlighting adjusted results in the quarter and year-to-date is included at the end of this press release.
During the quarter, we closed on the Synventive deal, the largest acquisition in Barnes Group's history and we're pleased with the initial operating performance delivered by this business. We believe that a growing Synventive, coupled with another record level of aerospace backlog, provides us with positive momentum, said Gregory F. Milzcik, Barnes Group Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer. Even with an uncertain near-term economic outlook, our continued investments in growth and our sustained focus on operational efficiencies, lead us to anticipate 2012 to be one of our better earnings years on record.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Synventive Acquisition Inc. and Subsidiaries
Peabody, Massachusetts
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synventive Acquisition, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Synventive Acquisition, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company
Synventive Acquisition, Inc. and its subsidiaries (SAI or the Company) are engaged in the business of designing, engineering and manufacturing hot runners that are used in molding processes for plastic and composite parts. The Company also provides parts and services for its installed equipment. The Company's largest market consists of toolmakers and suppliers to the automotive industry. Other significant customer segments for the Company include electronic equipment manufacturers and their suppliers, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers of high precision plastic parts. The Company usually sells directly to the manufacturer of the production tooling, but also has technical and specification relationships with the manufacturer of the plastic parts.
The Company has manufacturing facilities in Peabody, Massachusetts, Bensheim, Germany, and Suzhou, China. In addition, the Company has sales and service offices located in several countries in western, eastern and central Europe, and in India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil. In other geographical areas, agents represent the Company.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Synventive Acquisition, Inc. (Parent) and all of its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company has a 51% interest in one sales office. The results of operations and the balance sheet for this entity are included in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reports the income or loss and equity for the portion of the subsidiary that it does not own as noncontrolling interest in subsidiary.
Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, warranty reserves and deferred tax asset valuation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Revenues for products that require installation for which the installation is essential to functionality and is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon completion of installation. Revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation and warranty costs accrued. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to customers, and the related costs are included in the cost of sales. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis. The Company records the amounts collected as a current liability and relieves such liability upon remittance to the taxing authority without impacting revenues or expenses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers certificates of deposit and other highly liquid instruments

with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Bank Acceptances
Bank acceptances represent financial instruments accepted from certain Chinese customers in lieu of cash paid on trade receivables. Bank acceptances range from 3 to 6 months until maturity and are guaranteed by the bank. Bank acceptances can be converted to cash prior to maturity at a discount. Bank acceptances can also be used in certain circumstances to pay Chinese vendors. Bank acceptances represent a level 2 financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy as described in the fair value measurements policy note.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents monies escrowed in accordance with the long-term debt agreements. There was no restricted cash at December 31, 2011.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when received. A trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than 90 days.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (firstin, firstout) or market value. Inventory costs include material, labor, and manufacturing and engineering overhead. Inventories are reported net of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory items.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The Company is required to report in its financial statements, in addition to its net income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), which includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, including foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Company's only other comprehensive income (loss) item is its foreign currency translation adjustment.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Construction in progress is capitalized as costs are incurred. Depreciation or amortization does not commence until the asset is placed in service. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvement, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs of a routine nature are charged against earnings while those that improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment. The Company performs an annual assessment to determine if there is indication that goodwill or other indefinite lived assets are impaired. The Company works with a third party valuation specialist to conduct its impairment analysis each year in the fourth quarter using multiple analyses of the discounted cash flows based on historical and forecasted operating results and a market analysis. Based on the third party valuation performed in the fourth quarter of 2011, no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded for the year ending December 31, 2011. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets was recorded in the amounts of $15,806 and $1,152, respectively in 2010.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held for use is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the related asset group. No impairment of definite lived intangible assets was recorded in 2011 but $5,778 of impairment was recorded in 2010. Assets held for sale would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Debt Issuance Costs
Costs related to obtaining the term loans and senior debt financing in January 2008 were capitalized and amortized over the life of the respective terms of the debt of 6 years. The Company's restructuring of debt (the Restructuring), which closed on May 5, 2011 (the Restructuring Date), qualified for accounting in accordance with the standards for troubled debt restructuring. Under the standards for troubled debt restructuring, unamortized costs associated with the extinguished debt are expensed and costs, primarily legal and other professional fees, associated with negotiations regarding restructuring of the Company's debt first reduce the gain on cancellation of debt and then are charged to debt restructuring expense as incurred. Accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs was $0 and $4,173 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization of deferred financing costs charged to operations was $0 and $911 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in amortization expense.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits represent down payments in connection with the sale of equipment and parts or installment billings in advance of shipment. Customer deposits were $1,287 and $967 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
Expenses relating to the development of new products and improvements of existing products were $3,276 and $3,675 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were charged against earnings as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation
The U.S. Dollar is the Company's reporting currency for all years presented. Subsidiaries' accounts are remeasured to their respective functional currencies prior to translation. All asset and liability accounts of non-U.S. subsidiaries have been translated from their functional currency to U.S. Dollar at current exchange rates at the balance sheet date and related revenues and expenses have been translated at average rates of exchange in effect during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The resulting cumulative translation gains and losses are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit) and other comprehensive income (loss). Currency transaction gains and losses are recorded as other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. Translation gains and losses related to the dollar denominated bank debt

in foreign subsidiaries are also recorded as remeasurement gains and losses and reported in the statements of operations.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are used for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes. The fair value of each derivative is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet within current or long-term assets and liabilities depending on the length of the contract. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized immediately in the income statement for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of cash flow derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as hedges are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company's only derivative instrument is an interest rate cap contract, which does not qualify for hedge accounting.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company also reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. This methodology requires estimates and judgments in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and in the calculation of certain tax liabilities. In addition, the Company is required to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the positions as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the position are recognized. The more-likely-than-not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. In addition, the calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company records liabilities for estimated tax obligations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. These estimated tax liabilities include the provision for taxes that may become payable in the future. The Company will account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense. The Company files income tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for periods prior to 2008.
Advertising Expense
The Company follows the policy of charging the cost of advertising to expense, as incurred.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements by recognizing all share-based payments to employees, including grants of restricted stock, stock options and modifications to existing stock options, in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on the date of grant or modification.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of options granted. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the stock price, estimated based on third party valuations and other transactions, and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company does not have a history of market prices of the common stock as it is not a public company, and as such volatility is estimated using historical volatilities of similar public entities. The expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of paying no dividends. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Share-based

New Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs
. This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB, and collectively the Boards) on fair value measurement. The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011-04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value. The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. This ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company is evaluating the impact of the ASU on its financial statements. The FASB has issued ASU No. 2011-05,
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
(ASU 2011-05). This ASU allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The ASU does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. This ASU is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2012. The Company is evaluating the impact of the ASU on its financial statements.

The value of intangible assets increased (decreased) by $86 and $(1,464) in 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of changes in the currency translation, which is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). No impairment of goodwill or intangible assets was recorded in 2011 but impairment of goodwill and intangible assets totaling $15,806 and $6,930, respectively, were recorded in 2010. The impairment was recorded in the European reporting unit only. The impairment was the result of a decline in the overall hot runner market and sales volume due to the global financial crisis in the 2009-2010 timeframe. The impairment charge is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets in the European reporting unit, and the carrying value of the European reporting unit, as a whole, over their respective fair values. Fair value was determined by management based on a third party valuation using discounted cash flows and market analyses.

LONGTERM DEBT AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING
On December 31, 2010, the Company had $90,634 of outstanding principle due to the senior lenders on January 15, 2011 and $69,670 of outstanding principle and PIK interest due to the subordinated lenders in July of 2011. The Company and its shareholders held continuing discussions with the term loan and senior subordinated note holders beginning in March of 2010 relative to restructuring the obligations and recapitalizing the Company.
On May 5, 2011, the Company, its lenders and its owners entered into a master settlement and restructuring support agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Series A and B Senior Subordinated Note holders converted 100% of the subordinated notes plus accrued interest to common stock in Synventive Acquisition, Inc. Simultaneously, one of the Series A Note holders exchanged a portion of their senior term debt for common stock. This same lender had acquired most of the Company's subordinated debt as of the Restructuring Date and as such became the new majority shareholder in the Company. Immediately prior to the conversion transactions, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000 to 1,000,000 and also authorized 3,000 shares of new preferred stock.
The common stock issued in exchange for the senior and subordinated debt was recorded at fair value in accordance with accounting rules for troubled debt restructuring. Fair value of the debt exchanged and equity issued was determined based on transactions between the lenders up to and as of the transaction date and a third party valuation. The difference between the carrying value of the debt converted to equity and the fair value of the stock issued in exchange was recorded as a gain on extinguishment of debt in 2011 totaling $64,513. Lender, legal and financial advisor costs incurred in connection with the Restructuring totaled $4,705 and $5,301 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Costs incurred in 2011 reduced the gain and costs incurred in 2010 were charged to operating expense. All restricted common stock issued by the Company or exercisable under the equity incentive plan was considered worthless and cancelled in the Restructuring. The promissory notes executed to buy the restricted common stock were forgiven in the Restructuring. The Company implemented a new equity incentive plan in 2011 (Note 8).
The remaining term loans and revolving line of credit were amended as follows:
$59,000 of senior secured term loans are due and payable on December 31, 2015 and carry a variable interest rate calculated as follows: for LIBOR based loans, a floor of 1.5% for the first year and 2.0% for all subsequent years plus 3.75%, 4.25%, 5.25%, 6.75% and 7.75% for years 2011 through 2015, respectively, or the Bank's base rate plus 2.75%, 3.25%, 4.25%, 5.75% and 6.75%, respectively for base rate term loans. The Company entered into an interest rate cap contract, caps the LIBOR base rate at 2%. The fair value of the contract is de minimus and amounts paid for the contract were charged to interest expense. Interest paid on the new senior secured notes totaled $2,059 at December 31, 2011. The term loan covenants were amended to include fixed charge coverage and senior leverage ratios and a limit on capital expenditures. The loan is secured by all assets and cross-collateralized with the revolving line of credit.

On a pro-rata basis, the senior lenders exchanged $1,000 of term loans for new unsecured term loans in the same amount which hold a conversion-to-equity option if the term loan is not repaid by the maturity date of May 5, 2015. The notes are convertible into 100% of the new Series A-1 and A-2 preferred stock plus 3% of the outstanding common stock if certain triggering events occur, including default on the secured and/or unsecured term notes. The notes bear interest at 8.0% which accrues on the compounded balance semi-annually. Accrued interest on the unsecured senior term loans at December 31, 2011 totaled $53.
Management has reviewed the conversion feature of the debt and determined that it is not a derivative that needs to be bifurcated and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. Furthermore, management has evaluated the terms of the conversion feature and determined that it did not represent a beneficial conversion feature and as such has no value at inception.
A $7,250 revolving line of credit, less a sublimit of $1,000 for the issuance of standby letters of credit, was extended to the Company in connection with the restructuring and the existing line of credit was terminated. The maturity date of the new line of credit is May 5, 2015 and has an interest rate calculated as follows: for LIBOR based loans, a floor of 2.0% plus a 6.75% spread or for base rate loans, the bank's base rate plus a 5.75% spread. The revolver is also subject to a 1.0% annual charge on the unused balance, the total of which was $45 for the year ending December 31, 2011. The revolving line of credit contains the same collateral, forbearance and security arrangements as the term loan agreement. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no borrowings under the revolving credit agreement.
The fair value of the long-term debt approximates its carrying value at December 31, 2011. The fair value of the term loans approximated their carrying value at December 31, 2010. The fair value of the senior subordinated notes was approximately $7,000 at December 31, 2010. Fair value estimates are determined by management based on third party appraisals and recent transactions.

In April of 2008, the Company approved the issuance of an aggregate of 370 shares of restricted common stock, or 25% of the outstanding common stock, as of the effective date of the restricted stock plan. Shares were issued to certain officers and key employees on April 29, 2008 for $388.125 per share. Payment of the purchase price was made either (A) in cash, or (B) a promissory note bearing interest at 2.85% secured by the stock plus personal recourse for 50% of the note balance. The Board determined the value of the common stock based on a valuation prepared by a third party. The restricted stock vested over time and vesting would be accelerated upon a change in control of the Company provided that the stockholder was still employed by a Synventive entity or still an officer of the Company. In the event a restricted stockholder terminated employment, the Company had a call option on vested shares at fair value and on unvested shares at the lower of the issue price or fair value.
As a result of the Restructuring, the restricted stock was deemed to be worthless and was cancelled. The respective promissory notes and accrued interest used to purchase the restricted stock was charged to compensation as of the transaction date of May 5, 2011.
Equity Incentive Plan
On the Restructuring Date, 82,604 shares of SAI common stock were reserved for executive management incentive purposes. On July 31, 2011, executive management was granted non-qualified stock options totaling 63,179 shares. 19,425 shares are held in reserve as of December 31, 2011. Based on an external valuation of the Company and the sale of stock between owners on the Restructuring Date, the strike price of the options was set at $61.09 per share. The options vest and become exercisable with respect to 20% of the shares on the first anniversary of the Restructuring Date and shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 20% on each of the three subsequent anniversaries of the Restructuring Date, the final 20% vest and become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) a Change in Control or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the Restructuring Date provided the Optionee is employed by the Company on the date of such anniversary. All options vest on the earlier of a change of control or the aforementioned vesting dates.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the schedule below.

Warrants
In 2008, 110 common stock warrants were issued to the subordinated debt holders in exchange for their forgiveness of accrued default interest. The warrants could be exercised for 10% of the common stock in the Company for $.01 per share. The warrants were valued in 2008 at $415.84 each based on an option pricing valuation model and were adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date. The warrants were recorded as a liability in the balance sheet in the amount of $46 as of December 31, 2010, and were terminated in connection with the Restructuring on May 5, 2011.
Following is a summary of the income tax provision (benefit):
Differences between the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 34 percent and the effective rate is primarily due to international tax rates that differ from this rate and the valuation allowance which was increased in 2010 due to continued U.S. losses and which was released in 2011 as a result of the debt restructuring.

Deferred taxes are maintained in their respective jurisdictions. Deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these investments is not practicable.
The US Federal and state tax loss carryforwards were fully utilized in 2011 as a result of the Restructuring. The US Federal and state tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2010 were $23,410 and $22,604, respectively. There are US foreign tax credits at December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $961 and $474, respectively, which start to expire in 2012. The Company has established a valuation allowance on these credits given the uncertainty of utilizing them.
There are no tax loss carryforwards in Germany as of December 31, 2011 because of the Restructuring. There were $3,456 of tax loss carryforwards in Germany at December 31, 2010. There are tax loss carryforwards of $514 and $506 in Singapore at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The full amount of this loss is expected to be utilized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in other tax jurisdictions in Europe; however, given the uncertainty of utilizing these net operating losses, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against the losses.
The Company's manufacturing operations in China were exempt from corporate income tax and local income tax for the first two profit making years (after deducting losses incurred in previous years) and are also entitled to a 50% tax reduction for the succeeding three years (through 2010). The 50% tax rate reduction was extended for an additional two years (through 2012) as a result of certain patent filings in China.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company's U.S. net operating loss (NOL), foreign tax credit and State NOL were adjusted in the amounts of $1,875, $425 and $1,346, respectively, against the valuation reserve as a result of its more likely than not assessment. As of December 31, 2011, there were no adjustments to the NOLs as they were fully utilized in 2011 and the foreign tax credit was decreased by $425.

No direct asset allocation is held in relation to the Company's insurance contracts with Delta. Therefore, the fair value of the plan assets cannot be determined based on a certain asset allocation. As a result, the Company, with the assistance of their actuary, has estimated the fair value of the plan assets based on the accrued pension rights and actuarial rates. The Company funds the pension at a level required by Dutch law. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they are incurred rather than amortizing them over the projected benefit period.
The components of net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are:

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Prior to the Restructuring, the Company had agreed to pay an annual management fee to Advent International, the Company's former majority owner. This management fee was not to exceed $500 annually plus out of pocket expenses not to exceed $150 annually. During the year ended December 31, 2008, an amendment to the Company's Credit and Guaranty Agreement prohibited cash payments of the management fee, other than out of pocket expenses, until the senior lenders were paid in full. Management fees for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $648, which includes a fee of $132 to an officer of the Company. Accrued management fees totaled $2,732 as of December 31, 2010, and were included in related party payables. Also accrued in related party payables was $641 for unreimbursed costs paid by Advent on behalf of the Company. As a result of the Restructuring, the balance owed to Advent as of the Restructuring Date of $3,544 was cancelled and was charged to paid in capital in accordance with the accounting standards for troubled debt restructuring. In accordance with the revised credit agreement, the Company must pay an annual management fee to the Company's new majority owner, not to exceed $500 annually plus out of pocket expenses not to exceed $200 annually. For the year ended December 31, 2011, management fees were $171 and $558 under the former and current agreements, respectively. Additional management fees to an officer of the Company were $83, for total management fees of $812 for the year ended December 31, 2011. All management fees incurred under the new agreement were paid except for out of pocket expenses totaling $15 which are included in related party payable at December 31, 2011.
The Company warrants to the original purchaser of its products that it will repair or replace, without charge, products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect within a specified period. The warranty period is one year for components and parts and two to five years for hot runner systems. The Company estimates the cost that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company's warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. The Company uses historical trends to assist in determining the appropriate warranty accrual levels. Charges are included in cost of sales.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Under the FASB's authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various methods including market, income and cost approaches. Based on these approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value:
Bank acceptances
- given short term nature of maturities and quality of bank guarantee, the carrying value approximates fair value.
Common stock warrants
- the fair value of the common stock warrants was determined through the use of a third party valuation specialist and an option pricing model.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows:

There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2011. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2010 are summarized as follows:
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not make significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities. Common stock warrants were cancelled in connection with the Restructuring resulting in extinguishment of debt income.
The Company held $7,000 of Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2010. In accordance with Regulation S-X,  the Company was required to classify its Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010 in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.  The Preferred Stock was redeemable under certain circumstances within the control of the holders.  The preferred stock was subsequently cancelled in connection with the equity and debt restructuring on May 5, 2011.
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through April 30, 2012, the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. There were no additional matters requiring accrual or disclosure in the financial statements.

Synventive Acquisition Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") are engaged in the business of designing, engineering and manufacturing hot runners that are used in molding processes for plastic and composite parts. The Company also provides parts and services for its installed equipment.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information. The consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Synventive Acquisition, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.
The unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 as included as Exhibits 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A of Barnes Group, Inc. to which these statements are included as an exhibit.
Inventories consisted of the following as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011:
On May 5, 2011, the Company, its lenders and its owners entered into a master settlement and restructuring support agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Series A and B Senior Subordinated Note holders converted 100% of the subordinated notes plus accrued interest to common stock in Synventive Acquisition, Inc. Simultaneously, one of the Series A Note holders exchanged $30,634 of their senior term debt for common stock. The Company's balances of the subordinated notes and senior term debt, prior to the debt restructuring, were $49,000 and $90,634, respectively. The subordinated notes and senior term debt balances were $0 and $60,000, respectively, following the debt restructuring. The senior term debt was originally denominated in Euros, however it was denominated in US dollar and British Pound Sterling following the restructuring. The restructuring resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt during the six months ended July 2, 2011 of $60,093. The gain was reduced by lender, legal and financial advisor costs incurred in connection with the restructuring that totaled $4,421 during the six months ended July 2, 2011.
Interest expense was $1,840 and $5,324 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and July 2, 2011. The interest expense related to the senior debt was $1,723 and $1,835 during the 2012 and 2011 periods. The interest on the subordinated notes, which were also canceled on May 5, 2011, was $0 and $3,420 during the 2012 and 2011 periods. Foreign exchange gains were $438 and $7,732 during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and July 2, 2011. The foreign exchange gain of $7,732 in the 2011 period includes a gain of $7,938 that resulted from the senior term debt while it was Euro denominated.
The Company's effective tax rate for the first six months of 2012 was 28.1%. In 2011 the Company's effective tax rate was 16.3% in the first six months of the year and 14.6% for the full year. The tax rate for the first six months of 2011 includes $10,643 of discrete tax expense related to pre-tax income of $64,514 from the extinguishment of debt ($60,093 net of related fees). The increase in the 2012 effective tax rate was driven primarily by the absence of the discrete item as well as the change in the forecasted mix of earnings attributable to higher taxing jurisdictions or jurisdictions where losses cannot be benefited in 2012.
On August 27, 2012, the Company was sold to Barnes Group Inc. ("Barnes Group) pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 16, 2012 among Barnes Group, the Company, the stock and option holders of the Company, and Cetus Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Seller Representative (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Barnes Group acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $351,620, consisting of $306,083 in cash (including cash acquired of $9,366) and the assumption of $45,537 of debt.
Subsequent events have been evaluated through November 9, 2012, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

Exhibit 99.3
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On August 27, 2012, Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Synventive Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation (Synventive) pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 16, 2012 among the Company, Synventive, the stock and option holders of Synventive, and Cetus Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Seller Representative (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Synventive for an aggregate purchase price of $351,620, consisting of $306,083 in cash (including cash acquired of $9,366) and the assumption of $45,537 of debt. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, the Company paid $45,156 of the assumed debt, primarily using cash on hand. The remaining purchase price was financed primarily with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.
The attached unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the acquisition of Synventive. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income combine the historical statements of income of the Company and Synventive giving effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2011. The historical information of the Company and Synventive for the six months ended June 30, 2012 is unaudited. The historical information for the Company and Synventive for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 is derived from the audited financial statements of the Company and Synventive. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to matters that are (1) directly attributable to the acquisition, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes to the unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information and:
The unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and may differ from our final acquisition accounting as our final purchase price allocation is subject to post-closing adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
The unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information is presented for informational purposes only. It has been prepared in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had we completed the acquisition at the dates indicated, nor does it purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company. It also does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that we may achieve with respect to the combined company nor the costs necessary to achieve those costs savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements, or to integrate the operations of the Company and Synventive. The unaudited proforma condensed combined statements of income also include certain purchase accounting adjustments, including items expected to have a continuing impact on combined results, such as the effect of debt financing necessary to complete the acquisition as well as increased depreciation and amortization expense on acquired assets. The unaudited proforma condensed combined statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was not adjusted to exclude a $59,808 gain on extinguishment of debt.

Note 1  Purchase Price Allocation
The Company acquired Synventive for an aggregate purchase price of $351.6 million, consisting of $306.1 million in cash (including cash acquired of $9.4 million) and the assumption of $45.5 million of debt. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, the Company paid $45.2 million of the assumed debt, primarily using cash on hand. The remaining purchase price was financed primarily with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired, net of cash acquired, and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition (in millions):
Note 2 - Interest Expense on New Borrowings
The Company borrowed $308.4 million under its existing fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement") to fund the acquisition of Synventive. For purposes of the unaudited proforma combined condensed financial information, we have assumed our borrowing under our $750 million revolving credit facility was at an annual interest rate of 1.96% (based on our committed interest rate at the time of borrowing on August 24, 2012). As such, we have included approximately $3.0 million and $6.1 million of interest expense in our Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively, to reflect the interest expense had the transaction occurred on January 1, 2011. Additional interest expense totaled $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011. The additional expense during these periods relates primarily to the impact of higher interest rates as a result of the incremental debt associated with the financing of the acquisition.
As our interest rates under our revolving credit facility are not fixed, the actual rates of interest can change from those that are assumed above. If the actual interest rates incurred when the debt was actually drawn were to increase or decrease by 1/8% from the rates we have assumed in estimating the proforma interest expense adjustment, proforma interest expense on the incremental borrowings to fund the acquisition would increase or decrease by approximately $0.4 million per year.
Note 3 - Interest Expense on Borrowings
The Company paid a portion of the outstanding senior term debt that was held by Synventive in connection with the acquisition on August 27, 2012. We have excluded approximately $1.8 million and $7.1 million of interest expense in our Unaudited Proforma Combined Condensed Statement of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011,
respectively, to reflect the interest expense had the transaction occurred on January 1, 2011.
Note 4 - Intangible Asset Amortization - Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
As set forth in Note 1 above, the Company allocated $126.6 million of the purchase price to intangible assets. Of this balance, the Company has allocated $79.3 million of the purchase price to customer relationships with estimated economic lives of 15 years and $0.7 million to tradenames (product names) with estimated economic lives of 10 years. The incremental semi-annual and annual amortization expense for these acquired intangible assets will increase by approximately $2.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, using straight-line amortization, and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively.
Note 5 - Foreign Exchange Gains
The Company assumed a portion of the term debt of Synventive in conjunction with the acquisition. This debt was subsequently paid by the Company, partially through use of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign exchange gains of $0.4 million and $6.2 million have been excluded from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively, as the gains were associated with the term debt that was assumed by the Company. Such gains would not have been recorded had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2011.
Note 6 - Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
Synventive entered into a master settlement to restructure its debt on May 5, 2011. The troubled debt restructuring resulted in a gain of $59.8 million. Pursuant to the SEC reporting requirements, this gain was not removed from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
Note 7 - Amortization and Depreciation Expense - Cost of Sales
As set forth in Note 1 above, the Company allocated $126.6 million of the purchase price to intangible assets. Of this balance, acquired patents have been allocated a value of $35.4 million and have an estimated life of seven years. This adjustment represents the additional amortization related to the acquisition of patents and the step-up in fixed assets acquired had the business combination occurred on January 1, 2011. These adjustments include incremental amortization of $2.4 million and $4.8 million related to the acquired intangible assets during the six month period ended June 30, 2012 and the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011, respectively. The Company has also recorded a step-up in value of approximately $5.0 million related to Synventives property, plant and equipment. The step-up in value relates to depreciable assets with an average economic life of approximately seven years, resulting in annual depreciation of $0.7 million. The estimated semi-annual and annual depreciation expense for the step-up in value of these acquired assets is approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million using straight-line amortization, and has been included in cost of sales within the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively.
Note 8 - Bank Facility Fees
As discussed in Note 2 above, we borrowed $308.4 million under our Amended Credit Agreement to fund the acquisition of Synventive. These additional borrowings resulted in incremental bank facility fees of $1.3 million annually. Additional expenses, recorded as Other Expense within the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, approximated $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Note 9 - Tax Adjustments
We have reflected the applicable tax provision on the proforma adjustments presented in the unaudited proforma condensed combined statements of income. The proforma adjustments pertain primarily to the U.S. tax jurisdiction, and are subject to a 35% federal tax rate, plus applicable state taxes. However, certain acquisition-related proforma adjustments reflect limitations on taxability. These rates are estimates and do not take into account any possible future tax events that may occur for the combined Company.
Note 10 - Non-Recurring Acquisition Expenses
This adjustment of $1.3 million represents acquisition-related expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2012. We have removed these expenses from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 on the basis that they are non-recurring. No adjustment was made for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as there were no such costs incurred prior to January 1, 2012.
Note 11 - Equity Awards
Adjustments of $0.2 million and $0.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively, represent incremental expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted to Synventive employees on the date of the acquisition.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
BRISTOL, Conn., February 22, 2013
- Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), an international aerospace and industrial manufacturer and service provider, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Fourth quarter 2012 sales totaled $327.4 million, up 16% from $283.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, driven primarily by the sales contribution of the Synventive business. Income from continuing operations was $29.8 million or $0.54 per diluted share, up 26% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the full year, Barnes Group generated sales of $1,230 million, up 5% from last year. Income from continuing operations was $98.3 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share in 2011. Income from continuing operations in 2012 included $5.9 million pre-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, of short-term purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these acquisition related items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.86 for 2012. A table reconciling these non-GAAP adjusted results to our GAAP results is included at the end of this press release.
We delivered record fourth quarter Net Income despite lingering challenges in some of our global markets, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer of Barnes Group Inc. We've continued to transform our business by executing on our strategy of differentiated product and processes resulting in margin expansion. Even as some of our end-markets continued to reflect top-line softness, we generated improvement in operating margins. In addition, we completed the largest acquisition in the Company's history with Synventive and we end 2012 with a record year-end backlog of $677 million, up 16% from 2011. Milzcik continued, We're optimistic about 2013, with an expectation of continued growth in sales and profitability and furthering the substantial progress made in 2012.

The transaction, which is subject to customary conditions and approvals, is expected to close in late March or early in the second quarter of 2013. The BDNA business had 2012 revenues of approximately $300 million.
We're very pleased to announce the sale of our BDNA business to MSC Industrial Direct, said Gregory F. Milzcik, President and Chief Executive Officer of Barnes Group Inc.

As addressed in the Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2012 earnings release on February 22, 2013, Barnes Group will report BDNA as discontinued operations beginning with the first quarter of 2013. BDNA's financial results had been reported within the Company's Distribution segment. In addition, the remaining business within the Distribution segment, Associated Spring Raymond, has been realigned into the Company's Industrial segment.
The supplement has been compiled to provide financial results for 2008 to 2012 in a comparable manner to how current results of operations will be reported and is available on the investor relations, webcasts and presentations section of the Company's website at

.
Updates 2013 Full-Year Outlook and US Tax Court Decision
In addition, Barnes Group today updates its 2013 full-year guidance to include the impacts of the completed sale of BDNA and the Company's previously announced CEO transition.
Barnes Group now expects 2013 revenue from continuing operations to grow 17% to 20% from 2012. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are anticipated to be in the range of $1.71 to $1.86. Excluding $10.5 million pre-tax, or $0.12 per share, of non-recurring CEO transition costs associated with the modification of outstanding equity awards to the Company's former President & CEO, adjusted operating margins are expected to be approximately 14%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.98, up 20% to 30% from 2012's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.52.
On April 16, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court rendered an unfavorable decision against the Company, rejecting the Company's objections to a $16.5 million tax adjustment arising out of an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and imposing penalties. The Company is currently evaluating its options, including appealing the decision. The Company's guidance does not include any impact on expected earnings or cash flow as a result of the court's decision.

Pursuant to the terms of the APA, the total cash consideration for the BDNA Business was $550 million before adjustments for its estimated net working capital, subject to certain post closing adjustments.
The attached unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the sale of the BDNA Business. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company, which are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income reflect the Company's results as if the sale of the BDNA Business had occurred as of January 1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 reflects the Company's position as if the sale of the BDNA Business had occurred on that date.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to matters that are (1) directly attributable to the sale of the BDNA Business, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information and the historical audited financial statements of the Company included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 25, 2013.

Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the sale of the North American distribution business (the "BDNA Business"). The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company, which are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income reflect the Company's results as if the sale of the BDNA Business had occurred as of January 1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 reflects the Company's position as if the sale of the BDNA Business had occurred on that date.
Pro Forma Adjustments
On April 22, 2013, Barnes Group Inc. (the Company) completed the previously announced sale of its BDNA Business to MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. ("MSC") pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 22, 2013 (the "APA") between the Company and MSC. Pursuant to the terms of the APA, the total cash consideration for the BDNA Business was $550 million before adjustments for its estimated net working capital, subject to certain post closing adjustments.
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2012:
(1) The "Sale of the BDNA Business" column includes amounts representing the revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity attributable to the BDNA Business which were included in the Company's historical financial statements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the amounts eliminated on the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations do not include certain indirect corporate overhead included in general and administrative as such amounts would have been absorbed by the Company in the absence of the BDNA Business.
(2) The proceeds, net of related transaction costs, and the resulting net gain from the sale of the BDNA Business has been summarized below:
The above balances are preliminary and are subject to adjustments in future periods.
(3) Amounts represent the income tax provision and the taxes payable on the estimated pre-tax gain related to the sale of the BDNA Business. Taxes payable were impacted by the recognition of deferred taxes that had been earlier established and the utilization of net operating losses in the US and Canada. The income tax provision is based on the respective statutory rates effective for the transaction and reflects the impact of the non-deductible goodwill at the BDNA Business and the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses in Canada.
(4) The calculation of the gain on the sale of the BDNA Business includes estimated transaction costs that are directly attributable to the sale, but are not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income. Transaction costs include professional fees and other costs directly related to the sale of the BDNA Business.

BRISTOL, Conn., April 26, 2013
- Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), an international aerospace and industrial manufacturer and service provider, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Net sales from continuing operations increased 18% to $263.5 million from $222.8 million in the first quarter of 2012, driven by the sales contribution of the Synventive business. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was down 12% to $15.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, from $17.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, a year ago. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter included $10.5 million pre-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share, of non-recurring CEO transition costs associated with the modification of outstanding equity awards granted to the Company's former President & CEO. Excluding this item, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.40 for the first quarter of 2013, up 25% from last year. A table reconciling the non-GAAP adjusted results presented in this release to our GAAP results is included at the end of this press release.
Barnes Group delivered a solid first quarter of performance to begin the year, said Patrick J. Dempsey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Barnes Group Inc. We've continued to drive margin expansion through the successful execution of our corporate strategy to deliver sustainable profitable growth.

Updated 2013 Outlook
Barnes Group now expects 2013 revenue from continuing operations to grow 17% to 20% from 2012. GAAP Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are anticipated to be in the range of $1.71 to $1.86. This guidance includes the impacts from the sale of Barnes Distribution North America which closed on April 22, 2013, and the Company's previously announced CEO transition.
Excluding $10.5 million pre-tax, or $0.12 per share, in non-recurring costs associated with the Company's CEO transition, adjusted operating margins are expected to be approximately 14%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.98, up 20% to 30% from 2012's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.52.
On April 16, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court rendered an unfavorable decision against the Company, rejecting the Company's objections to a $16.5 million tax adjustment arising out of an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and imposing penalties. The Company is currently evaluating its options, including appealing the decision. The Company's guidance does not include any impact on expected earnings or cash flows as a result of the court's decision.
The Company expects cash flows to be negatively impacted by approximately $13 million in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the decision. In addition, in the second quarter of 2013, following the Company's evaluation, the Company could record an income tax charge of up to approximately $20 million and a reduction in its deferred tax assets to reflect the utilization of a portion of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards.

(1) Results for 2012 have been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect the impact of the BDNA discontinued operations, including a reallocation of corporate overhead expenses, and the segment realignment.
(2) The Company has excluded short-term purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs related to its Synventive acquisition in 2012 and CEO transition costs associated with the modification of outstanding equity awards in 2013 from its "as adjusted" financial measurements. On April 16, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court rendered an unfavorable decision against the Company, rejecting the Companys objections to a $16.5 million tax adjustment arising out of an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and imposing penalties. The Company is currently evaluating its options, including appealing the decision. The Companys guidance does not include any impact on expected earnings or cash flows as a result of the courts decision. Management believes that these adjustments provide the Company and its investors with an indication of our baseline performance excluding items that are not considered to be reflective of our ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's performance. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use.
