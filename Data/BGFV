Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV), the leading sporting goods retailer in the western United States, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2003 first quarter that ended on March 30, 2003.
El Segundo, CA  May 1, 2003 
For the 2003 first quarter, net sales increased by $7.4 million, or 4.7%, to $164.5 million from $157.1 million in the first quarter of 2002. Same store sales increased 0.6% versus the first quarter last year, representing the company's twenty-ninth consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales over comparable prior periods. Gross profit margin increased 0.2% during the first quarter to 35.2% from gross profit margin of 35.0% for the same period last year. Selling and administration expenses were 27.4% of net sales, compared with 26.8% of net sales for the same period last year.
Net income available to common stockholders for the 2003 first quarter, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), increased to $3.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income available to common stockholders of $1.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year. Results for the fiscal 2003 first quarter include $875,000, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to a charge associated with the redemption of $20.0 million face value of the company's 10.875% senior notes. Excluding this charge, net income available to stockholders for the 2003 first quarter was $4.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This compares to 2002 first quarter pro forma net income available to stockholders of $4.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, which excludes certain effects related to the company's initial public offering (IPO) and exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option in mid-2002.

"We are delighted to have achieved our twenty-ninth consecutive quarter of positive same store sales performance and to have provided earnings that exceeded our guidance, despite a significantly challenging business environment," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We faced a generally lackluster retail climate, diverted consumer interest caused by the war in Iraq and, during the first half of the quarter, record warm weather conditions in our primary markets that adversely affected sales of winter-related products. We overcame these challenging circumstances and produced solid results on the strength of positive performance in our footwear, hardgoods and non-winter-related apparel categories. The fact that we performed so well during this difficult quarter is a real credit to the strength of our experienced team and proven merchandising formula."
Big 5 also announced that during the first quarter, the company had completed the previously-announced redemption of $20.0 million face value of its 10.875% senior notes and had finalized a new three-year $140.0 million non-amortizing revolving credit facility with a group of banks led by The CIT Group.
Big 5 reports net income and earnings per diluted share in accordance with GAAP and additionally on a pro forma basis to exclude certain effects of the company's IPO, including the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. The company raised a total of $84.0 million of net proceeds from the IPO, which occurred in June 2002, during the company's second fiscal quarter, and the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, which occurred in July 2002, during the company's third fiscal quarter. During the company's third fiscal quarter, the company utilized IPO proceeds and borrowings under its credit facility to redeem all of Big 5's outstanding senior discount notes and preferred stock and to repurchase approximately 500,000 shares of common stock from non-executive employees. The pro forma figures assume that the IPO took place at the beginning of the periods presented and exclude the effects of certain one-time IPO-related and over-allotment expenses, use of funds generated from the reduction of the redemption premium otherwise applicable to the redemption of preferred stock to pay bonuses in connection with the IPO, interest payments and premiums payable on debt redeemed in connection with the IPO, dividends and premiums payable on preferred stock redeemed in connection with the IPO and related income tax effects. Big 5 uses this pro forma reporting internally to evaluate its operating performance without regard to certain non-recurring financial effects of the IPO and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into its operating results. A reconciliation of the pro forma adjustments to GAAP appears in the financial statements portion of this release.
Big 5 expects to realize same store sales in the slightly negative to low single-digit positive range for the second fiscal quarter of 2003, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.28 to $0.31. For the fiscal year ending December 28, 2003, the company currently expects to realize same store sales in the low single-digit positive range, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.18 to $1.23. The quarterly estimate of earnings per diluted share is calculated in accordance with GAAP. The full-year estimate of earnings per diluted share excludes $0.04 per diluted share, recorded in the fiscal 2003 first quarter, related to the charge associated with the partial redemption of the company's senior notes.

Our sales trends improved during the 2003 third quarter over the first half of the year, benefiting from the return of more normal weather patterns as well as indications of a healthier consumer environment.

(xvii) There are no pending actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect, or would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or which are otherwise material in the context of the sale of the Offered Securities; and no such 4
actions, suits or proceedings are, to the Company's knowledge, threatened or contemplated. (xviii) The financial statements included in each Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly the financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates shown and their results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown, and such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis and the schedules included in each Registration Statement present fairly the information required to be stated therein; and the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial data included in each Registration Statement and the Prospectus provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the transactions or events described therein, the related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and the pro forma data reflect the proper application of those adjustments to the corresponding historical financial statement amounts. (xix) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, since the date of the latest audited financial statements included in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, except as disclosed in or contemplated by the Prospectus, there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of its capital stock.

(xxi) All material Tax returns required to be filed by the Company and each of its subsidiaries have been filed and all such returns are true, complete, and correct in all material respects. All material Taxes that are due or claimed to be due from the Company and each of its subsidiaries have been paid other than those (i) currently payable without penalty or interest or (ii) being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), adequate reserves have been established on the books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. There are no proposed, material Tax assessments against the Company or any of its subsidiaries as to which the Company has been notified. To the Company's knowledge, the accruals and reserves on the books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax liability for any taxable period not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments of Tax for any such period. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "TAX" and "TAXES" shall mean all federal, state, local and foreign taxes, and other assessments of a similar nature (whether imposed directly or through withholding), including any interest, additions to tax, or penalties applicable thereto. 5
(xxii) Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which would reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or resale of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that the Company does not make any representation or warranty about the activities of the Selling Stockholder in this clause (xxii); (xxiii) KPMG LLP, who have certified the audited financial statements included in each Registration Statement and the Prospectus, are independent public auditors as required by the Act and the Rules and Regulations.

(xxiv) The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (A) has received notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that substantial capital improvements or other material expenditures will have to be made in order to continue such insurance or (B) has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. (xxv) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA"); no "reportable event" (as defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any "pension plan" (as defined in ERISA) for which the Company would have any liability; the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur material liability under (A) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any "pension plan" or (B) Section 412 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("CODE"); and each "pension plan" for which the Company and each of its subsidiaries would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification. (xxvi) The Amendment to the Credit Agreement of Big 5 Corp., dated as of October 31, 2003 (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT") has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Big 5 Corp., and the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement Amendment will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (A) any statute, any rule, 6
regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties, (B) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject, except for such breaches, violations or defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (C) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any such subsidiary. (xxvii) The redemption of $35,000,000 in principal amount of the 10.875% senior notes due 2007 of Big 5 Corp. has been duly authorized by Big 5 Corp., Big 5 Corp. has provided all notices required in order to redeem the 10.875% senior notes due 2007, and such redemption will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (A) any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties, (B) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject, except for such breaches, violations or defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (C) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any such subsidiary.

(ii) All information furnished by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement and Prospectus is, and on the Effective Date will be, true, correct, and complete in all material respects, and does not, and on the Effective Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make such information not misleading. Such Selling Stockholder confirms as accurate (x) the information in the Prospectus under the caption "Selling Stockholder" and (y) the information in the Prospectus under the caption "Principal and Selling Stockholders" as such information relates to the Selling Stockholder. 7
(iii) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between such Selling Stockholder and any person that would give rise to a valid claim against such Selling Stockholder or any Underwriter for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment in connection with this offering. (iv) Such Selling Stockholder has reviewed the Registration Statement and the sale of the Offered Securities by such Selling Stockholder pursuant hereto is not prompted by any information concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is not set forth in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto. (v) Neither the Selling Stockholder, nor any of its affiliates, has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which would reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or resale of the Offered Securities. 3. Purchase, Sale and Delivery of Offered Securities. On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Selling Stockholder agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Selling Stockholder, at a purchase price of $17.214 per share, that number of Firm Securities (rounded up or down, as determined by Credit Suisse First Boston LLC ("CSFB") in its discretion, in order to avoid fractions) obtained by multiplying 5,200,000 shares of Firm Securities by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Firm Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule A hereto and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Firm Securities. Certificates in negotiable form for the Offered Securities to be sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder have been placed in custody, for delivery under this Agreement, under a Custody Agreement made with the Company, as custodian ("CUSTODIAN"). The Selling Stockholder agrees that the shares represented by the certificates held in custody for the Selling Stockholder under such Custody Agreement are subject to the interests of the Underwriters hereunder, that the arrangements made by the Selling Stockholder for such custody are to that extent irrevocable, and that the obligations of the Selling Stockholder hereunder shall not be terminated by operation of law, whether by the death of any general partner of the general partner of the Selling Stockholder or the occurrence of any other event. If any general partner of the general partner of the Selling Stockholder should die, or if any other such event should occur, or if the Selling Stockholder is dissolved or terminated, before the delivery of the Offered Securities hereunder, certificates for such Offered Securities shall be delivered by the Custodian in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if such death or other event or termination had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Custodian shall have received notice of such death or other event or termination. The Custodian will deliver the Firm Securities to the Representative for the accounts of the Underwriters against payment of the purchase price in Federal (same day) funds by official bank check or checks or wire transfer to an account at a bank acceptable to CSFB drawn to the order of Green Equity Investors, L.P., at the office of Irell & Manella LLP, 1800 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 900, Los Angeles, California 90067, at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on November 21, 2003, or at such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as CSFB and the Company determine, such time being herein referred to as the "FIRST CLOSING DATE". For purposes of Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, the First Closing Date (if later than the otherwise applicable settlement date) shall be the settlement date for 8
payment of funds and delivery of securities for all the Offered Securities sold pursuant to the offering. The certificates for the Firm Securities to be delivered will be in definitive form, in such denominations and registered in such names as CSFB requests and will be made available for checking and packaging at the above office of Irell & Manella LLP at least 24 hours prior to the First Closing Date. In addition, upon written notice from CSFB given to the Selling Stockholder from time to time not more than 30 days subsequent to the date of the Prospectus, the Underwriters may purchase all or less than all of the Optional Securities at the purchase price per Security to be paid for the Firm Securities. The Selling Stockholder agrees to sell to the Underwriters the respective numbers of shares of Optional Securities specified in such notice. Such Optional Securities shall be purchased from the Selling Stockholder for the account of each Underwriter in the same proportion as the number of shares of Firm Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name bears to the total number of shares of Firm Securities (subject to adjustment by CSFB to eliminate fractions) and may be purchased by the Underwriters only for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the sale of the Firm Securities. No Optional Securities shall be sold or delivered unless the Firm Securities previously have been, or simultaneously are, sold and delivered. The right to purchase the Optional Securities or any portion thereof may be exercised from time to time and to the extent not previously exercised may be surrendered and terminated at any time upon notice by CSFB to the Selling Stockholder. Each time for the delivery of and payment for the Optional Securities, being herein referred to as an "OPTIONAL CLOSING DATE", which may be the First Closing Date (the First Closing Date and each Optional Closing Date, if any, being sometimes referred to as a "CLOSING DATE"), shall be determined by CSFB but shall be not later than five full business days after written notice of election to purchase Optional Securities is given. The Custodian will deliver the Optional Securities being purchased on each Optional Closing Date to the Representative for the accounts of the several Underwriters against payment of the purchase price therefor in Federal (same day) funds by official bank check or checks or wire transfer to an account at a bank acceptable to CSFB drawn to the order of Green Equity Investors, L.P., at the above office of Irell & Manella LLP. The certificates for the Optional Securities being purchased on each Optional Closing Date will be in definitive form, in such denominations and registered in such names as CSFB requests upon reasonable notice prior to such Optional Closing Date and will be made available for checking and packaging at the above office of Irell & Manella LLP at a reasonable time in advance of such Optional Closing Date. 4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Offered Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Prospectus. 5. Certain Agreements of the Company and the Selling Stockholder. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters and the Selling Stockholder that: (a) The Company will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with subparagraph (3) (or, if applicable and if consented to by CSFB, subparagraph (5)) of Rule 424(b) not later than the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company will advise CSFB promptly of any such filing pursuant to Rule 424(b). If an additional registration statement is necessary to register a portion of the Offered Securities under the Act but the Effective Time thereof has not occurred as of such execution and delivery, the Company will file the additional registration statement or, if filed, will file a post-effective amendment thereto with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 462(b) on or prior to 10:00 P.M., New York time, on the date of this Agreement or, if earlier, on 9
or prior to the time the Prospectus is printed and distributed to any Underwriter, or will make such filing at such later date as shall have been consented to by CSFB. (b) The Company will advise CSFB promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and will not effect such amendment or supplementation without CSFB's consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld; and the Company will also advise CSFB promptly of the effectiveness of each Registration Statement (if its effective time is subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement) and of any amendment or supplementation of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of a Registration Statement and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued. (c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company will promptly notify CSFB of such event and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither CSFB's consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6. (d) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months after the date of this Agreement, the Company will make generally available to its securityholders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or, if later, the effective date of any additional Registration Statement) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act. (e) The Company will furnish to the Representative copies of each Registration Statement (six of which will be signed and will include all exhibits), each related preliminary prospectus, and, so long as a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case in such quantities as CSFB requests. The Prospectus shall be so furnished on or prior to 3:00 P.M., New York time, on the business day following the later of the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All other documents shall be so furnished as soon as available. The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Underwriters all such documents. (f) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as CSFB designates and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution. (g) For a period of 90 days after the date of this Agreement, the Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to, any additional shares of its 10
Securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its Securities, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of CSFB, except grants of employee stock options pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, issuances of Securities pursuant to the exercise of such options and the filing with the Commission of a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such options and Securities. (h) The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, for any filing fees and other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with qualification of the Offered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as CSFB designates and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any applicable filing fee incident to the review by the NASD of the Offered Securities, for any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of the Offered Securities, and for expenses incurred in distributing preliminary prospectuses and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) to the Underwriters. The Selling Stockholder agrees with the several Underwriters to pay (directly or by reimbursement) all fees and expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement which are not otherwise specifically provided for herein, including but not limited to any transfer taxes on the sale by the Selling Stockholder of Offered Securities to the Underwriters and the fees and expenses of such Selling Stockholder's counsel. (i) The Selling Stockholder agrees to deliver to the Company, as Custodian under the Custody Agreement, on or prior to the First Closing Date a properly completed and executed United States Treasury Department Form W-9 (or other applicable form or statement specified by Treasury Department regulations in lieu thereof). The Company agrees to file a Form 1099 on behalf of the Selling Stockholder in connection with the sale of Securities by the Selling Stockholder. (j) The Selling Stockholder agrees, for a period of 90 days after the date of this Agreement, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any additional shares of the Securities of the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of Securities, enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Securities, whether any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of the Securities or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of CSFB. 6. Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Firm Securities on the First Closing Date and the Optional Securities to be purchased on each Optional Closing Date will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Selling Stockholder herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company and the Selling Stockholder of their obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent: 11

(c) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as one enterprise which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representative, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Offered Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (iv) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange; (v) any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (vi) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities; or (vii) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States or (viii) any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representative, the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, act, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities. 13
(d) The Representative shall have received an opinion, dated such Closing Date, of Irell & Manella LLP, counsel for the Company, to the effect that: (i) Each of the Company and Big 5 Corp. has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; and each of the Company and Big 5 Corp. is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in each jurisdiction listed in a schedule to be attached to the legal opinion; (ii) The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the Prospectus. Except as set forth in the Prospectus, to such counsel's knowledge, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, any securities convertible into, or any contracts or commitments to issue or sell, shares of the Company's capital stock or any such options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or obligations; (iii) The Offered Securities and all other issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and its subsidiary Big 5 Corp., have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and all of the capital stock of Big 5 Corp. is owned of record by the Company; (iv) The Offered Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus; (v) Other than the agreements listed in Schedule B, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings known to such counsel between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the Act with respect to any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to include such securities in the securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement or in any securities being registered pursuant to any other registration statement filed by the Company under the Act; (vi) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Offered Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940; (vii) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required to be obtained or made by the Company under any law which in such counsel's experience is generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the sale of the Offered Securities, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Exchange Act and such as may be required by the NASD or under state securities laws; 14
(viii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (A) any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or its subsidiary Big 5 Corp. or any of their properties which in our experience is generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, (B) or any agreement or instrument that is included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to which the Company or such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or such subsidiary is subject, or (C) the charter or by-laws of the Company or such subsidiary; (ix) The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Act as of the date and time specified in such opinion, the additional Registration Statement (if any) was filed and became effective under the Act as of the date and time (if determinable) specified in such opinion, the Prospectus either was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) specified in such opinion on the date specified therein or was included in the Registration Statement or the additional Registration Statement (as the case may be), and, to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act, and each Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement thereto, as of their respective effective or issue dates, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations; and (x) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. In addition, such counsel shall state that they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public or certified public accountants for the Company and with representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon (except for the opinions explicitly given above) and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except for the opinions explicitly given above) and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to their attention which would lead them to believe that either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date or as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief as to the financial statements or schedules or other financial or statistical data derived therefrom, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto). 15
(e) The Representative shall have received an opinion, dated such Closing Date, of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel for the Selling Stockholder, to the effect that: (i) The Selling Stockholder has all requisite limited partnership power and authority to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the Offered Securities delivered by such Selling Stockholder on such Closing Date hereunder; (ii) Upon payment of the purchase price therefor in accordance with this Agreement and assuming that neither the Representative nor any Underwriter has notice of any adverse claims (within the meaning of Section 8105 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted and in effect on the date hereof in the State of California (the "UCC")) with respect to the stock certificates or the Offered Securities represented thereby delivered on the date hereof, upon delivery (within the meaning of Section 8301(a)(1) of the UCC) to the Representative of such stock certificates endorsed in blank by an effective endorsement (within the meaning of Section 8106(b)(1) of the UCC), each Underwriter will acquire its interest in such stock certificates (and the Offered Securities represented thereby) free of any adverse claims (as defined in Section 8102(a)(1) of the UCC) under Section 8303(b) of the UCC; (iii) The execution, delivery and performance of the Custody Agreement and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein and herein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, the limited partnership agreement of the Selling Stockholder; (iv) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required to be obtained or made by the Selling Stockholder under any law which in such counsel's experience is generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and the Custody Agreement for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Custody Agreement or this Agreement in connection with the sale of the Offered Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and such as may be required under the Exchange Act and state securities laws; (v) The execution, delivery and performance of the Custody Agreement and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein and herein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (a) any statute, any rule or regulation which in such counsel's experience is generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and the Custody Agreement, (b) any order of any governmental agency or any court having jurisdiction over the Selling Stockholder identified to us by the Selling Stockholder or (c) any of the agreements listed on Schedule A to such counsel's opinion [schedule to include exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Form S-3 shelf registration statement]; (vi) The Custody Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Selling Stockholder and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Selling Stockholder enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to 16
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and (vii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Selling Stockholder. (f) The Representative shall have received from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated such Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the Registration Statements, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representative may require, and the Selling Stockholder and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (g) The Representative shall have received a certificate, dated such Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that: the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct; the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to such Closing Date; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission; the additional Registration Statement (if any) satisfying the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (3) of Rule 462(b) was filed pursuant to Rule 462(b), including payment of the applicable filing fee in accordance with Rule 111(a) or (b) under the Act, prior to the time the Prospectus was printed and distributed to any Underwriter; and, subsequent to the dates of the most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in the Prospectus or as described in such certificate. (h) The Representative shall have received a certificate, dated such Closing Date, of two executive officers of the general partner of the Selling Stockholder in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder in this Agreement are true and correct and that the Selling Stockholder has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to such Closing Date. (i) The Representative shall have received a letter, dated such Closing Date, of KPMG LLP, which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section 6, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three days prior to such Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection. (j) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Representative shall have received lockup letters from each of the executive officers and directors of the Company. The Selling Stockholder and the Company will furnish the Representative with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representative reasonably requests. CSFB may 17
in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder, whether in respect of an Optional Closing Date or otherwise. 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (c) below; and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Offered Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Offered Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter, and if the Prospectus (as so amended and supplemental) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. (b) The Selling Stockholder will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Selling Stockholder will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, 18
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (c) below; provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (b) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Offered Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Offered Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter, and if the Prospectus (as so amended and supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability; provided, further, that the Selling Stockholder shall only be subject to such liability to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is based upon information provided by the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Selling Stockholder consists of the information set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Selling Stockholder" and the information set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Principal and Selling Stockholders" as such information relates to the Selling Stockholder; and provided, further, that the liability under this subsection of the Selling Stockholder shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds after underwriting commissions and discounts, but before expenses, to the Selling Stockholder from the sale of Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder. (c) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, and the Selling Stockholder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Selling Stockholder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the fourth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting." 19
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; provided, however, that (i) the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure and (ii) the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholder or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably 20
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (f) The obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholder under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed a Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Default of Underwriters. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder on either the First or any Optional Closing Date and the aggregate number of shares of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of shares of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date, CSFB may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Selling Stockholder for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by such Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate number of shares of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of shares of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to CSFB, the Company and the Selling Stockholder for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Stockholder, except as provided in Section 9 (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Optional Securities after the First Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Securities or any Optional Securities purchased prior to such termination). As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 8. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 9. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Selling Stockholder, of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment 21
for the Offered Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by them pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company, the Selling Stockholder, and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of Section 6(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. 10. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to the Representative, c/o Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10010-3629, Attention: Transactions Advisory Group, or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation, 2525 East El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245, Attention: Gary Meade, Esq., or, if sent to the Selling Stockholder, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to Leonard Green & Associates, L.P., 11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, California 90025, Attention: Jonathan A. Seiffer; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7 will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to such Underwriter. 11. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective personal representatives and successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 12. Representation. The Representative will act for the several Underwriters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any action under this Agreement taken by the Representative will be binding upon all the Underwriters. 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement. 14. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW AND NEW YORK CIVIL PRACTICE LAWS AND RULES 327(b). The Company hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 22

Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure
     On November 21, 2003, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") closed the public offering of 5,200,000 shares of its common stock at $18.12 per share. All of the shares were sold by Green Equity Investors, L.P. As a result of the completion of the offering, and without giving effect to the possible exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, Green Equity Investors, L.P.'s beneficial ownership of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from approximately 27.4% to approximately 4.5%.

Robert Jaffe PondelWilkinson MS&L (323) 866-6007
Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) today reported financial results for the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter and full year that ended on December 28, 2003.
El Segundo, CA  February 11, 2004 
For the 2003 fourth quarter, net sales increased by $15.1 million, or 8.5%, to $191.8 million from $176.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Same store sales increased 3.6% versus the fourth quarter last year, representing the company's thirty-second consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales over comparable prior periods. Net income available to common stockholders for the 2003 fourth quarter, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), increased to $9.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared with net income available to common stockholders of $8.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income available to stockholders for the 2003 fourth quarter includes a charge of $1.2 million, net of taxes, associated with the redemption of $35.0 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes. Excluding this charge, net income available to stockholders for the 2003 fourth quarter was $11.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share.
For fiscal 2003, net sales increased by $42.2 million, or 6.3%, to $709.7 million from $667.5 million for fiscal year 2002. Same store sales for fiscal 2003 increased 2.2% versus fiscal 2002. Net income available to common stockholders for fiscal 2003, reported in accordance with GAAP, increased to $26.3 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income available to common stockholders of $11.1 million, or $0.57 per diluted share in the same period last year. Net income available to stockholders for fiscal 2003 includes a charge of $2.1 million, net of taxes, associated
 
Big 5 Sporting Goods 2-2-2
with the redemption of $55.0 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes. Excluding this charge, net income available to stockholders for fiscal 2003 was $28.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares with pro forma net income available to common stockholders for fiscal 2002 of $24.6 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, which excludes certain effects related to the company's initial public offering.
Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report another outstanding quarter and full year for Big 5 Sporting Goods. The fourth quarter was our strongest comp store quarterly performance of the year and represented our 32nd consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales. Our comp store performance was solid in each of our five geographic regions and for each of our three major merchandise categories  footwear, apparel and hard goods. Our positive sales results, combined with higher profit margins, sound expense controls and lower interest costs enabled us to deliver excellent bottom-line results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2003. We believe we are well positioned to continue this strong performance in 2004."
Big 5 reports net income and earnings per diluted share in accordance with GAAP and additionally on a pro forma basis to exclude certain effects of the company's senior note redemption (as described above) and to exclude certain effects of the company's fiscal 2002 IPO. The company raised a total of $84.0 million of net proceeds from the IPO, which were used along with borrowings under its credit facility to redeem all of Big 5's then outstanding senior discount notes and preferred stock and to repurchase approximately 500,000 shares of common stock from non-executive employees. The pro forma figures for fiscal 2002 assume that the IPO took place at the beginning of 2002 and exclude the effects of certain one-time IPO-related and over-allotment expenses, use of funds generated from the reduction of the redemption premium otherwise applicable to the redemption of preferred stock to pay bonuses in connection with the IPO, interest payments and premiums payable on debt redeemed in connection with the IPO, dividends and premiums payable on preferred stock redeemed in connection with the IPO and related income tax effects. Big 5 uses this pro forma reporting internally to evaluate its operating performance without regard to certain non-recurring financial effects of the IPO and certain financial effects of the 2003 partial senior note redemptions and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into its operating results. A reconciliation of the senior note redemptions and IPO-related pro forma adjustments to GAAP appears in the financial statements portion of this release.
Store Openings
During the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter, Big 5 opened 11 new stores, including three in Arizona, two each in California, Idaho, and Colorado, and one each in Nevada and Washington. These openings brought the company's year-end store count to 293 versus 275 at the end of fiscal 2002. The company anticipates opening between 15 and 20 stores in fiscal 2004.
EPS Guidance
Big 5 expects to realize same store sales growth in the mid-single-digit range for the first fiscal quarter of 2004, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.25. For the 2004 fiscal year, the company currently expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.47 to $1.53. Fiscal 2004 will include 53 weeks for accounting purposes, with the extra week being included in the company's fourth quarter results. This additional week should add approximately 1.75% to fiscal 2004 sales versus fiscal 2003, but should not have a material impact on earnings results for the fourth quarter or year.

Big 5 reports net income and earnings per diluted share in accordance with GAAP and additionally on a pro forma basis to exclude certain effects of the company's senior note redemptions (as described above). Big 5 uses this pro forma reporting internally to evaluate its operating performance without regard to certain financial effects of its partial senior note redemptions and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into its operating results. A reconciliation of the senior note redemptions pro forma adjustments to GAAP appears in the financial statements portion of this release. STORE OPENINGS The company ended the fiscal 2004 second quarter operating 295 stores, opening one new store during the quarter. The company anticipates opening between 13 and 16 additional new stores by the end of fiscal 2004. EPS GUIDANCE Big 5 expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.34 to $0.36. For the 2004 fiscal year, the company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and expects pro forma earnings to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.61 per diluted share, which is unchanged from previous guidance. The full year estimate of earnings per diluted share excludes the $0.02 per diluted share charge recorded in the second quarter associated with a redemption of $15.0 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes. Fiscal 2004 will include 53 weeks for accounting purposes, with the extra week being included in the company's fourth quarter results. This additional week should add approximately 1.75% to fiscal 2004 sales versus fiscal 2003, but should not have a material impact on earnings results for the fourth quarter or fiscal year. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION Big 5 will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific) to discuss financial results for the quarter ended June 27, 2004. The webcast will be available at www.big5sportinggoods.com and archived for 30 days.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1

John Mills Integrated Corporate Relations, Inc. (310) 395-0259
Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2004 third quarter and nine months ended September 26, 2004.
El Segundo, CA  October 27, 2004 
For the 2004 third quarter, net sales increased 6.8% to $195.8 million from $183.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Same store sales calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") increased 2.6% versus the same quarter last year, representing the company's 35th consecutive quarter of same store sales growth over comparable prior periods. Excluding the effect of the implementation of a sales return allowance discussed below, same store sales increased 3.6% versus the same quarter last year. Management uses this measure to analyze the company's performance without regard to the effect of the implementation of the sales return allowance and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into the company's operating results and a more consistent basis for comparing the company's current operating results with those of prior periods. Net income increased to $8.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the 2004 third quarter, compared to net income of $6.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
For the nine-month period ended September 26, 2004, net sales increased 8.4% to $561.3 million from $517.9 million in the same period last year and same store sales calculated in accordance with GAAP increased 3.9% versus the same nine months of 2003. Excluding the effect of the implementation of a sales return allowance discussed below, same store sales increased 4.2% versus the same period last year. Management uses this measure to analyze the company's performance without regard to the effect of the implementation of the sales return allowance and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into the company's operating results and a more consistent basis for comparing the company's current operating results with those of prior periods. Net income
 
Big 5 Sporting Goods - -2-
increased to $22.7 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared to net income of $16.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 include a second quarter charge of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, net of taxes, associated with the redemption of $15.0 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes, and results for the same period in fiscal 2003 include a similar debt redemption charge of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, net of taxes.
"We are pleased to announce very positive third quarter earnings results which exceeded both our range of guidance and analyst estimates," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved our 35th consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales, and once again we produced comp store gains across each of our five geographic regions and for each of our three major merchandise categories  footwear, apparel and hard goods. We believe that we are well positioned to continue this momentum through the remainder of 2004 and beyond.
"We are also excited to announce the opening today of our 300th store, located in San Diego, California. Our achievement of this milestone is a credit to the strength and dedication of the entire Big 5 team."
Initiation of Quarterly Cash Dividend
The company also announced that its Board of Directors has voted to initiate a cash dividend, at an annual rate of $0.28 per share of outstanding common stock. The first quarterly payment, of $0.07 per share, will be paid on December 15, 2004, to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2004.
"Our consistently strong operating results and disciplined debt management strategy have positioned us not only to continue to grow, but also to deliver excess cash from operations to our stockholders," said Steven G. Miller. "While we plan to use cash flow from operations to expand our store base in the same manner as we have in the past and to continue to pay down our debt, we are pleased to further enhance stockholder value with this dividend."
Planned Redemption of Senior Notes
The company also announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Big 5 Corp., is pursuing an enhancement of its current revolving debt facility that will allow it to repurchase the remaining $33.1 million principal amount outstanding of its 10.875% senior notes. The senior notes were issued in November 1997 and originally totaled $131 million. As part of this redemption plan, Big 5 Corp. has provided notice of its intention to redeem $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes on November 30, 2004 using funds available under the company's revolving credit facility.
Big 5 expects to complete the redemption in the fourth quarter, and, based on current interest rates, estimates that the redemption will result in annualized interest expense savings of approximately $1.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
The senior notes will be redeemed at 101.825% of their face value and taking into account the write-off of unamortized financing fees and original issue discount, the company will recognize a resulting after-tax charge of approximately $650,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the 2004 fiscal fourth quarter.
 
Big 5 Sporting Goods - -3-
Sales Returns Allowance
During the fiscal 2004 third quarter, Big 5 changed its accounting for sales returns by establishing an allowance for estimated sales returns. This resulted in a cumulative adjustment in the third quarter to establish the allowance, which will be adjusted based on the company's estimated sales returns at the end of each quarter going forward. The cumulative effect of this accounting change resulted in a reduction of approximately $1.9 million in net sales, $0.7 million in gross profit, and $0.4 million in net income, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the third quarter and nine months. In prior periods, the company's net sales were reported net of actual sales returns. The difference between recording actual sales returns and establishing an allowance for sales returns is not material to the company's prior period financial statements.
Store Openings
Big 5 opened three new stores during the 2004 third quarter and two additional stores subsequent to the end of the quarter, bringing its current total store count to 300. Big 5 plans to complete its fiscal 2004 store openings with the addition of nine more stores before year-end, resulting in a year-end store count of 309 stores.
EPS Guidance
Big 5 expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. For the 2004 fiscal year, the company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and expects earnings to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.62 per diluted share, up from previous guidance of $1.55 to $1.61 per diluted share. The full year estimate of earnings per diluted share excludes the $0.02 per diluted share charge recorded in the second quarter associated with the redemption of $15.0 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes, as well as an anticipated $0.03 per diluted share charge to be recorded in the fourth quarter associated with the anticipated redemption of the remaining $33.1 million principal amount of the company's 10.875% senior notes in the fourth quarter. Management uses this measure to evaluate the company's operating performance without regard to certain financial effects of its partial senior note redemptions and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into the company's operating results. Calculated in accordance with GAAP, the full year earnings estimate is in the range of $1.53 to $1.57 per diluted share. Fiscal 2004 will include 53 weeks for accounting purposes, with the extra week being included in the company's fourth quarter results. This additional week should add approximately 1.75% to fiscal 2004 sales versus fiscal 2003, but should not have a material impact on earnings results for the fourth quarter or fiscal year.
Conference Call Information
Big 5 will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific) to discuss financial results for the quarter ended September 26, 2004. The webcast will be available at www.big5sportinggoods.com and archived for 30 days.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On December 15, 2004, Big 5 Corp. ("Big 5 Corp."), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company"), and Big 5 Services Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Corp. ("Big 5 Services" and, together with Big 5 Corp., the "Borrowers"), entered into, and consummated the closing of, a Second Amended and Restated Financing Agreement (the "Amended Credit Facility") dated as of December 15, 2004 with The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (as Agent and as Lender) and the other Lenders named therein. The Amended Credit Facility increased the aggregate amount of available loans to the Borrowers from $140 million to $160 million . The Amended Credit Facility provides for a new $20 million term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility") and a $140 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility").
     Upon the closing of the Amended Credit Facility, Big 5 Corp. borrowed $20.0 million under the Term Loan Facility. Big 5 Corp. will use these proceeds, together with drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to redeem all of its remaining 10.875% senior notes due 2007 on December 22, 2004.
     The Term Loan Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 1.00% when the term loan balance is $10,000,000 or less, and LIBOR plus 3.50% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 1.50% when the term loan balance is greater than $10,000,000.
     The Term Loan Facility is repayable as follows: $6,666,667 in principal amount of the Term Loan Facility will be due and payable on each of the first and second anniversary dates of the Amended Credit Facility, and the remaining balance will be due and payable on the third anniversary date of the Amended Credit Facility. The Borrowers may prepay the Term Loan Facility at any time without penalty; provided, however, that the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid only in whole or in $5.0 million increments of principal thereof and only so long as the Borrowers have at least $25.0 million in availability under the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to any such prepayments during the months of February through September of any year or $35.0 million after giving effect to any such prepayments during the months of October through January of any year. Each prepayment of the Term Loan facility will be applied to the then last maturing installment of principal under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, the Term Loan Facility will become due and payable in full upon the termination of the Amended Credit Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility.
     From the date of the Amended Credit Facility through June 30, 2005, the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate. From July 1, 2005 and thereafter, the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at various rates based on the Borrowers' performance and the average balance of revolving loans and undrawn letters of credit, with a floor of LIBOR plus 1.25% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of LIBOR plus 2.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 0.50%. An annual fee of 0.325%, payable monthly, is assessed on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Borrowers' maximum eligible borrowing available under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited to the lesser of 75% of the aggregate value of eligible inventory or 88% of the liquidation value of such inventory during October through December and the lesser of 70% of the aggregate value of eligible inventory or 85% of the liquidation value of such inventory during the remaining months of the year.
     The Amended Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the ability of the Borrowers to, among other things: (i) incur liens; (ii) incur additional indebtedness; (iii) transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) merge, consolidate or alter their line of business; (v) guarantee obligations; (vi) in the case of Big 5 Corp., declare or pay dividends in excess of certain permitted amounts or make other distributions or repurchase its stock; and (vii) make advances, loans or investments.
Table of Contents
     The Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to pay when due amounts in respect of the Term Loan Facility; failure to pay any other amounts under the Amended Credit Facility for 10 days after becoming due; failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility for a period of 15 days after Agent's discovery of such non-compliance; acceleration of more than $3.0 million of certain other indebtedness; and certain bankruptcy events.
     Both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a general lien and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers, including accounts receivable, documents, equipment, general intangibles and inventory. Any proceeds of the collateral will be applied first to amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and then to amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The Company has guaranteed the obligations of the Borrowers under the Amended Credit Facility.
     The Amended Credit Facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least 90 days prior written notice before any anniversary date, commencing with its anniversary date on March 20, 2008. The Borrowers may terminate the Amended Credit Facility by giving at least 30 days prior written notice, provided that if the Borrowers terminate the Amended Credit Facility prior to March 20, 2008, they must pay, depending on the date of such termination, an early termination fee between 0.25% and 0.75% of the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility. Unless it is terminated, the Amended Credit Facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on March 21, 2008.
     The terms of the Amended Credit Facility were established in an arms-length negotiation in which The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. acted as agent for the various lenders. There are no material relationships between the Agent and the other lenders under the Amended Credit Facility and the Company or the Borrowers, other than that the Agent served as agent and as a lender, and the lenders under the Amended Credit Facility were lenders, under the Borrowers' prior credit facility. The Agent will receive customary fees in connection with its services as agent under the Amended Credit Facility. The outstanding amount of indebtedness under the Borrowers' prior revolving credit facility, which was approximately $100.0 million as of December 15, 2004, was unchanged as a result of the Borrowers' entering into the Amended Credit Facility.
     The above description of the Amended Credit Facility does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Amended Credit Facility and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Any information disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or the exhibits hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material.

Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date as if made on and as of such date.

(b) Each borrowing by the Companies hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Companies as of the date of such loan or advance that each of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Financing Agreement have been satisfied and are true and correct, except as the Companies and the Agent and/or the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree herein or in a separate writing. SECTION 3. REVOLVING LOANS 3.1. The Revolving Lenders, acting through the Agent, agree, subject to the terms and conditions of this Financing Agreement from time to time, and within (x) the Availability and y) the Line of Credit, but subject to the Agent's and the Revolving Lenders' (acting through the Agent) rights to make "Overadvances", to make loans and advances to the Companies on a revolving basis, and subject to the limitations set forth herein, the Companies may borrow, repay and re-borrow Revolving Loans. All Revolving Loans shall be made by the Revolving Lenders simultaneously and in accordance with their pro rata shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, nor shall any commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) no failure by any Revolving Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder shall excuse any other Revolving Lender from its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Revolving Lender hereunder shall be several, not joint and several. Such loans and advances shall be in amounts up to the lesser of (i) during the months of October, November, and December of each year, the lesser of seventy-five percent (75%) of the value of Eligible Inventory or eighty-eight percent (88%) of the orderly liquidation value (net of all costs and expenses) of the Eligible Inventory; and (ii) during the months of January through September of each year, the lesser of seventy percent (70%) of the value of the Eligible Inventory or eighty-five percent (85%) of the orderly liquidation value (net of all costs and expenses) of the Eligible Inventory. The value of Eligible Inventory shall be determined at cost, by the cost inventory method, using a valuation on a first in, first out basis in accordance with GAAP excluding capitalized buying, handling and distribution costs, as reflected on the Companies' books and records. The net orderly liquidation value of the Eligible Inventory shall be determined from time to time in the -17-
Agent's Reasonable Discretion taking into account the results of the latest appraisal. Companies shall pay the cost of the appraisal, provided that so long as no Event of Default has occurred (unless such Event of Default has been cured to the extent permitted by and under the terms of this Financing Agreement), Companies shall not be charged with the cost of such appraisal more than once per calendar year. All requests for loans and advances (other than LIBOR Loans) must be received by an officer of the Agent no later than 2:00 p.m. New York time on the Business Day on which such loans and advances are required. Should the Companies request advances in excess of the limitations set forth in this Section 3.1, such advances shall be considered "Overadvances" and, shall be made by the Agent only with the consent of the Required Lenders and in the sole discretion of the Required Lenders, subject to any additional terms the Required Lenders deem necessary, and subject to the terms and provisions of clause (c) of Section 12.10 hereof. 3.2. In furtherance of the continuing collateral assignment and security interest in each Company's Accounts and Inventory, each Company shall deliver to the Agent not later than: (1) if and when requested in writing by Agent, an aging of such Company's Trade Accounts Receivable in such form and manner as the Agent may reasonably require but consistent with the current practices of such Company; (2) fourteen (14) days after the end of each month (other than October, November and December), a monthly inventory confirmation statement stating the aggregate amount of Eligible Inventory of the Companies; and (3) five (5) Business Days after each Sunday in the months of October, November and December, a weekly Inventory confirmation statement stating the aggregate amount of Eligible Inventory of the Companies. With respect to all such reports, each Company will provide to the Agent such additional information and material as the Agent may reasonably request to effectively evaluate the Trade Accounts Receivable and the collectability thereof and the mix of the Inventory and such other information as the Agent may reasonably require to evaluate the Companies' Trade Accounts Receivable and Inventory, such as returns, claims, credits, allowances and information identifying and describing the Trade Accounts Receivable. Failure to provide the Agent with the foregoing information will in no way effect, diminish, modify, or limit the security interest granted herein. Such reports are to be executed by a responsible officer of each Company. 3.3. Each Company hereby represents and warrants that: (a) sales of Inventory are, and shall be, based upon actual and bona fide sales and deliveries of Inventory (x) in the ordinary course of such Company's business, (y) in connection with the liquidation of an immaterial portion of the Inventory or (z) after the occurrence of a casualty loss, bulk sales of salvageable Inventory, and that, in any instance, the Inventory being sold and the proceeds thereof are the exclusive property of such Company and are not and shall not be subject to any lien, charge, arrangement, encumbrance, security interest, or financing statement whatsoever other than the Permitted Encumbrances, provided, however that if there is then no Default or Event of Default, the Companies may make charitable transfers of Inventory in an aggregate amount for both Companies not to exceed $1,500,000 in any fiscal year; (b) invoices representing Trade Accounts Receivable or credit card receipts evidencing credit card sales are in the name of such Company and except for disputes, offsets, defenses, counterclaims, contras, returns or credits, all arising in the normal course of such Company's business or except as may be promptly disclosed to the Agent, the purchasers of such Inventory owe and are obligated to pay the amount stated in the invoices -18-
or credit card receipts; and (c) except for the Permitted Encumbrances, any and all taxes and fees relating to its business are such Company's sole responsibility and that same will be paid when due (except as otherwise provided in this Financing Agreement), and that none of said taxes or fees represent a lien on or claim against the proceeds of any sale of Inventory. Each Company agrees to issue credit memoranda promptly. Each Company also warrants and represents that it is a duly and validly existing corporation and is qualified to transact business in all states where the failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business of such Company or the ability of such Company to enforce collection of Trade Accounts Receivable due from Persons residing in that state. 3.4. During the term of this Financing Agreement, the Company may and will, at its expense, consistent with such Company's existing business practices, enforce, collect and receive all amounts owing on the Accounts. Except for the Retained Cash, all checks or cash from the sale of Inventory must be deposited promptly to the Depository Accounts, and promptly thereafter and therefrom, to a Blocked Account. Each Company shall require that all amounts due under credit card sales be remitted by the credit card companies to a Blocked Account. Each Company agrees that it will only direct the flow of funds from the Depository Accounts and the credit card remitters to the Blocked Accounts. The institutions holding such Blocked Accounts will be instructed that when it is satisfied that such funds on deposit are "good funds", such institution will remit such "good funds" to the applicable Company's operating account. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if (x) there is then an Event of Default or (y) the Companies have Availability of less than zero ($0) for three (3) consecutive Business Days, then the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, may advise the banks holding the Blocked Accounts to remit all proceeds of Collateral to the Agent for the account of the Lenders. The Agent will immediately rescind these instructions (a) upon the waiver of the Event of Default and (b) when the Companies have Availability of zero ($0) or greater. All amounts received by the Agent for the account of the Lenders will be credited to the Obligations upon the Agent's receipt of "good funds" at its bank account in New York, New York on the Business Day of receipt if received no later than 2 p.m. New York time or on the next succeeding Business Day if received after 2 p.m. New York time. No checks, drafts or other instruments received by the Agent will constitute final payment unless and until such instruments have actually been collected. If the loan account reflects a zero Revolving Loan balance and there is then no Event of Default, then the Agent shall promptly remit to the operating accounts of the Companies any credit balances in the loan account. 3.5. (a) The Agent shall maintain a single separate account on its books in the name of both of the Companies' in which the Companies will be charged with loans, advances and payments under the Letter of Credit Guaranty, made to either Company or for its account, and with any other Obligations, including any and all reasonable costs, expenses and reasonable and documented attorney's fees which the Agent may incur in connection with the exercise of any of the rights or powers herein conferred or in the prosecution or defense of any action or proceeding to enforce or protect any rights of the Agent or of any Lender in connection with this Financing Agreement or the Collateral assigned hereunder, or any Obligations owing by the Companies. The Companies will be credited with all amounts received by the Agent from the Companies or from others for the Companies' account, including, as above set forth, all amounts received by the Agent in payment of Accounts and -19-
such amounts will be applied to payment of the Obligations. In no event shall prior recourse to any Accounts or other security granted to or by the Companies be a prerequisite to the Agent's right to demand payment of any Obligation. Further, it is understood that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to perform in any respect any of either Company's contracts or obligations relating to the Accounts. (b) The Companies are engaged in an integrated operation that requires financing on a basis permitting the availability of credit from time to time to each Company as required for the continued successful operation of each Company. Each Company expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from such availability since the successful operation of each Company is dependent on the continued successful performance of the functions of the integrated group. In order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of the Companies in the most efficient and economical manner, and in order to facilitate the handling of the accounts of the Companies on the Agent's books, the Companies have requested, and the Agent has agreed to handle accounts of the Companies on the Agent's books on a combined basis. Accordingly, in lieu of maintaining separate accounts on the Agent's books in the name of each of the Companies, the Agent shall maintain one account. Loans and advances made by the Agent to the Companies will be charged to the account indicated above, along with any charges and expenses under this Financing Agreement. The loan account will be credited, with all amounts received by the Agent from either of the Companies or from others for their account. It is expressly understood and agreed by each Company that the Agent shall have no obligation to account separately to either Company. It is expressly understood and agreed by each of the Companies that the Agent shall have no responsibility to inquire into the correctness of the apportionment, allocation, or disposition of (X) any loans and advances made to either of the Companies or (Y) any of the Agent's expenses and charges relating thereto. The Companies jointly and severally unconditionally guarantee to the Agent and the Lenders the prompt payment in full of (A) all loans and advances made and to be made by the Agent and/or the Lenders to any of them under this Financing Agreement, as well as (B) all other Obligations of the Companies to the Agent and/or the Lenders and hereby expressly confirm in all respects the suretyship waivers and cross-guaranties executed by each of the Companies in the Agent's and/or the Lenders' favor. All collateral security now or hereafter given to the Agent and/or the Lenders by any of the Companies, shall secure all loans and advances made by the Agent and/or the Lenders to any of the Companies, and shall be deemed to be pledged to the Agent as security for any and all other Obligations of the Companies to the Agent and/or the Lenders as set forth under any Financing Document. It is understood that, notwithstanding the fact that each Company is a distinct and separate legal entity, the handling of the accounts of the Companies in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, has been done solely at the Companies' request and as an accommodation to the Companies, and that the Agent shall incur no liability to the Companies as a result thereof. To induce the Agent and the Lenders to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Company hereby agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Agent and/or the Lenders by any of the Companies or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred solely by reason of (1) the method of handling the accounts of the Companies as herein provided, (2) the Agent relying on any instructions of any of the Companies, or (3) any other action taken by the Agent in accordance with this Section 3.5(b) of this Financing -20-
Agreement, provided, however that Companies shall not be liable for the foregoing indemnification obligations in the event such liability, expense, loss or claim arises primarily from such indemnified party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 3.6. After the end of each month, the Agent, on its own behalf and/or acting on behalf of the Lenders, shall promptly send the Companies a statement showing the accounting for the charges, loans, advances, payments under the Letter of Credit Guaranty, and other transactions occurring between the Agent, on its own behalf, and/or acting on behalf of the Lenders and the Companies during that month. The monthly statement shall be deemed correct and binding upon the Companies and shall constitute an account stated between the Companies, the Agent, and the Lenders unless the Agent receives a written statement of the exceptions within thirty (30) days of the date of the monthly statement. 3.7. In the event that (a) the outstanding balance of Revolving Loans exceeds (b) the amount calculated as (i) the lesser of (A) the Line of Credit or (B) the Borrowing Base, minus (ii) the Availability Reserves, any such nonconsensual Overadvance shall be due and payable to Agent immediately upon Agent's demand therefor; provided, however, that any consensual Overadvance made pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof shall be due as and when specified in the requisite consent of Required Lenders. SECTION 4. LETTERS OF CREDIT In order to assist the Companies in establishing or opening i) documentary Letters of Credit with an Issuing Bank to cover the purchase and importation of inventory and ii) standby Letters of Credit with an Issuing Bank to cover such other matters as the Companies may so decide, other than for the purchase of Inventory or to secure present or future Trade Accounts Payable, the Companies have requested the Agent, acting on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, to join in the applications for such Letters of Credit, and/or guarantee payment or performance of such Letters of Credit and any drafts or acceptances thereunder through the issuance of the Letters of Credit Guaranty, thereby lending the Revolving Lenders' credit to the Companies, and the Revolving Lenders, acting through the Agent, have agreed to do so. These arrangements shall be handled by the Agent, acting on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. 4.1. Within the Line of Credit and subject to Availability, the Revolving Lenders, acting through the Agent, shall assist the Companies in obtaining such Letters of Credit in an aggregate amount for both Companies outstanding at any one time not to exceed the Letter of Credit Sub-Line. The Agent's assistance with respect to Letters of Credit for amounts in excess of the limitations set forth herein shall at all times and in all respects be in the Agent's sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Default and/or an Event of Default, the Agent's assistance with respect to any Letters of Credit shall be in the Agent's sole discretion unless such Event of Default is waived in writing, or such Default is cured to the Agent's satisfaction in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment during any applicable grace or cure period. 4.2. The Agent, acting on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, shall have the right, without notice to the Companies, to charge the loan account with the amount of any and all indebtedness, liability or obligation of any kind paid or incurred under the Letters of -21-
Credit Guaranty at the earlier of: a) payment by the Agent under the Letters of Credit Guaranty, or b) termination of this Financing Agreement in accordance with Section 10 of this Financing Agreement. Any amount so charged to the loan account shall be charged against any credit balances then in the loan account, and if there are then insufficient credit balances then to the extent of such insufficiency such amount shall be deemed a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall incur interest at the rate provided for in Section 7.1 of this Financing Agreement. 4.3. [Intentionally Left Blank]. 4.4. In connection with any Letter of Credit, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for: the existence, character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of the goods purporting to be represented by any documents; any difference or variation in the character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of the goods from that expressed in the documents; the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of any documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged, other than as a result of the gross negligence of the Agent and/or any Revolving Lender; the time, place, manner or order in which shipment is made; partial or incomplete shipment, or failure or omission to ship any or all of the goods referred to in the Letters of Credit or documents; any deviation from instructions; delay, default, or fraud by the shipper and/or anyone else in connection with any Inventory which is the subject of any Letter of Credit or the shipping thereof; or any breach of contract between the shipper or vendors and either Company. Furthermore, without being limited by the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any act or omission with respect to or in connection with any Inventory which is the subject of any Letter of Credit. 4.5. In connection with any Letter of Credit, the Companies agree that any action taken by the Agent, if taken in good faith, or any action taken by any Issuing Bank, under or in connection with the Letters of Credit, the guarantees, the drafts or acceptances, or the Collateral, shall, as between the Companies and the Agent, be binding on the Companies and shall not put the Agent or any Revolving Lender in any resulting liability to the Companies other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such Revolving Lender. After the occurrence of an Event of Default which is not waived, the Agent shall have the full right and authority to clear and resolve any questions of non-compliance of documents; to give any instructions as to acceptance or rejection of any documents or goods; to execute any and all steamship or airways guaranties (and applications therefor), indemnities or delivery orders; to grant any extensions of the maturity of, time of payment for, or time of presentation of, any drafts, acceptances, or documents; and to agree to any amendments, renewals, extensions, modifications, changes or cancellations of any of the terms or conditions of any of the applications, Letters of Credit, drafts or acceptances; all in the Agent's sole name, and the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to comply with and honor any and all such documents or instruments executed by or received solely from the Agent, all without any notice to or any consent from the Companies, provided, however, that the Agent shall give the applicable Company notice of the acceptance or rejection of any goods. -22-
4.6. In connection with any Letter of Credit, without the Agent's express consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and, where applicable, endorsement in writing, the Companies agree: a) not to execute any and all applications for steamship or airway guaranties, indemnities or delivery orders; to grant any extensions of the maturity of, time of payment for, or time of presentation of, any drafts, acceptances or documents; or to agree to any amendments, renewals, extensions, modifications or changes of any of the terms or conditions of any of the Letters of Credit, applications, drafts or acceptances; and b) after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is not waived, not to i) clear and resolve any questions of non-compliance of documents, or ii) give any instructions as to acceptance or rejection of any documents or goods. 4.7. In connection with any Letter of Credit, the Companies agree that any necessary import, export or other licenses or certificates for the import or handling of the Inventory will have been promptly procured, and all foreign and domestic governmental laws and regulations in regard to the shipment and importation of the Inventory, or the financing thereof will have been promptly and fully complied with, except to the extent that any such non-procurement or non-compliance will not have a material adverse effect on such Inventory; and any certificates in that regard that the Agent, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, may at any time reasonably request will be promptly furnished. In this connection, each Company warrants and represents that, to its actual knowledge, all shipments made under any of the Letters of Credit are in accordance with the laws and regulations of the countries in which the shipments originate and terminate, and are not prohibited by any such laws and regulations, except to the extent that any failure to so comply will not have a material adverse effect on such shipments. The Companies assume all risk, liability and responsibility for, and agree to pay and discharge, all present and future local, state, federal or foreign taxes, duties, or levies in connection with any Inventory or goods purchased, imported or acquired under the Letter of Credit. Any embargo, restriction, laws, customs or regulations of any country, state, province, city, or other political subdivision, where the Inventory is or may be located, or wherein payments are to be made, or wherein drafts may be drawn, negotiated, accepted, or paid, shall be solely the Companies' risk, liability and responsibility. 4.8. Upon any payments made to the Issuing Bank under the Letter of Credit Guaranty, the Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, shall acquire by subrogation, any rights, remedies, duties or obligations granted or undertaken by either Company to the Issuing Bank in any application for Letters of Credit, any standing agreement relating to Letters of Credit or otherwise, all of which shall be deemed to have been granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders and apply in all respects to the Agent and the Revolving Lenders and shall be in addition to any rights, remedies, duties or obligations contained herein. 4.9. Nothing in this Financing Agreement is intended to relieve any Issuing Bank from any liability to any Person. -23-
SECTION 4.A. TERM LOAN 4.A.1 Each Company hereby agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent on behalf of the Term Lenders the Term Loan Promissory Notes, to evidence the Term Loan to be extended by the Agent on behalf of the Term Lenders. 4.A.2 Upon the Agent's receipt of the Term Loan Promissory Notes, the Term Lenders hereby agree to extend to the Companies the Term Loan. 4.A.3 Subject to Section 4.A.4 below, the principal amount of the Term Loan shall be repaid by the Companies to the Agent on behalf of the Term Lenders as follows: Six Million Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($6,666,667) on the date occurring one (1) year from the Closing Date; Six Million Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($6,666,667) on the date occurring two (2) years from the Closing Date; and the remaining principal balance, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the date occurring three (3) years from the Closing Date; provided, however, the Companies may prepay, without penalty, the principal amount of the Term Loan, at any time, at their option, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or, if less, the remaining balance thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that at the time of any such prepayment and after giving effect thereto, (a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under the Financing Agreement and (b) the Availability under the Revolving Loans shall be at least $25,000,000 after giving effect to any prepayment made during the months of February through September of any year or $35,000,000 after giving effect to any prepayment made during the months of October through January of any year. Once repaid in whole or in part, the Term Loan may not be reborrowed under this Financing Agreement. Prepayments of the Term Loan will be applied to principal installments in inverse order of maturity. 4.A.4 In the event this Financing Agreement or the Line of Credit is terminated by the Agent, the Required Lenders or the Companies or any one of them pursuant to the terms of this Financing Agreement, the Term Loan shall become due and payable on the effective date of such termination notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Term Loan Promissory Notes or this Financing Agreement. 4.A.5 Each Company hereby authorizes the Agent to charge the Companies' loan account with the amount of all Obligations owing under this Section 4A hereof as such amounts become due. 4.A.6 Upon any repayment of the Term Loan and so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Line of Credit will automatically increase by an amount equal to such repayment and the Commitment of each Term Lender who is also a Revolving Lender with respect to Revolving Loans shall increase in an amount equal to its pro rata share of such repayment. Upon any such automatic increase, there shall be a settlement among the Revolving Lenders so as to ensure that, as of the date of such automatic increase, the Revolving Lenders shall have their proportionate share of all outstanding Obligations relating to the Revolving Loans. -24-
SECTION 5. COLLATERAL 5.1. As security for the prompt payment in full of all loans and advances made and to be made to the Companies from time to time by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders pursuant hereto, as well as to secure the payment in full of the other Obligations, each Company hereby pledges and grants to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a continuing general lien upon and security interest in all of its: (a) Accounts; (b) Documents of Title; (c) Equipment; (d) General Intangibles; (e) Inventory; and (f) Other Collateral. 5.2. The security interests granted hereunder shall extend and attach to: (a) All Collateral which is presently in existence and which is owned by either Company or in which either Company has any interest (but only to the extent of such interest), whether held by either Company or others for its account; (b) All Inventory and any portion thereof which may be returned, rejected, reclaimed or repossessed by the Agent or either Company from any of either Company's customers, as well as to all supplies, goods, incidentals, packaging materials, labels and any other items which contribute to the finished goods or products manufactured or processed by either Company, or to the sale, promotion or shipment thereof. 5.3. Each Company agrees to take reasonable steps, consistent with current business practices, to safeguard, protect and hold all Inventory and make no disposition thereof except in the manner or for the purpose described in Section 3.3 of this Financing Agreement. Inventory may be sold and shipped by each Company to its customers in the ordinary course of such Company's business, and such Company will collect all proceeds of such sales, consistent with reasonable business practices in existence on the date of execution of this Financing Agreement or consistent with the business practices of like companies in the retail industry, provided, however, that all proceeds of all such sales (including cash, checks and instruments for the payment of money), other than the Retained Cash, are promptly deposited in accordance with Section 3.4 of this Financing Agreement. Upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition of Inventory, as herein provided, the security interest in the Inventory provided for herein shall, without break in continuity and without further formality or act, continue in, and attach to, the proceeds, including any instruments for the payment of money, accounts receivable, contract rights, documents of title, shipping documents, chattel paper and all other cash and non-cash proceeds of such sale, exchange or disposition. As to any such sale, exchange or other disposition, the Agent -25-
on behalf of the Lenders shall have a security interest in all of the rights of each Company as an unpaid seller, including stoppage in transit, replevin, rescission and reclamation. Each Company hereby agrees to immediately forward any and all proceeds of Collateral (other than Retained Cash) to the Depository Account, and to hold any such proceeds (including any notes and instruments), in trust for the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, pending delivery to the Agent. Irrespective of the Agent's perfection status in any and all of the General Intangibles, including, without limitations, any Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights or licenses with respect thereto, each Company hereby irrevocably grants the Agent a royalty free license to sell, or otherwise dispose of or transfer, in accordance with Section 9.3 of this Financing Agreement, and the applicable terms hereof, any of the Inventory upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which has not been waived in writing by the Agent. 5.4. The rights and security interests granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders hereunder are to continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the termination of this Financing Agreement or the fact that the loan account on the books of the Agent may from time to time be temporarily in a credit position, until the satisfaction in full of all Obligations and the termination of this Financing Agreement. Any delay or omission by the Agent to exercise any right hereunder, shall not be deemed a waiver thereof, or be deemed a waiver of any other right, unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the Agent. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion. Upon satisfaction in full of all Obligations and the termination of this Financing Agreement, the Agent will take, at the Companies' request and expense, all actions and do all things reasonably necessary to release the rights and security interests in the Collateral, and upon any partial release of Collateral, the Agent will take, at the Companies' request and expense, all actions and do all things reasonably necessary to release the rights and security interests in the Collateral that is the subject of such partial release. 5.5. To the extent that the Obligations are now or hereafter secured by any assets or property other than the Collateral or by the guarantee, endorsement, assets or property of any other person, then the Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine which rights, security, liens, security interests or remedies the Agent shall at any time pursue, foreclose upon, relinquish, subordinate, modify or take any other action with respect to, without in any way modifying or affecting any of them, or any of the Agent's or any Lenders' rights hereunder. 5.6. Any reserves or credit balances in the loan account and any other property or assets of either Company in the possession of the Agent may be held by the Agent as security for any Obligations and applied in whole or partial satisfaction of such Obligations when due. The liens and security interests granted herein and any other lien or security interest the Agent may have in any other assets of the Companies, shall secure payment and performance of all now existing and future Obligations. The Agent may, in its Reasonable Discretion, charge any or all of the Obligations to the loan account when due. 5.7. Each Company possesses all General Intangibles and rights thereto necessary to conduct its business as conducted as of the Closing Date and each Company shall maintain its rights in, and the value of, the foregoing in the ordinary course of its -26-
business, including, without limitation, by making timely payment with respect to any applicable licensed rights. Each Company shall deliver to the Agent, and/or shall cause the appropriate party to deliver to the Agent, from time to time such pledge or security agreements with respect to General Intangibles (now or hereafter acquired) of such Company and its subsidiaries as the Agent shall reasonably require to obtain valid first liens thereon (subject to the Permitted Encumbrances set forth in the definition thereof in clauses (i) (if and to the extent consented to by Lenders as senior liens), (ii), (vi), (vii), (ix), (x), (xi), and, with respect to such clauses only, (xii)). In furtherance of the foregoing, each Company shall provide timely notice to the Agent of any additional Patents, Trademarks, trade names, service marks, Copyrights, brand names, trade names, logos and other trade designations acquired or applied for subsequent to the Closing Date and each Company shall execute such documentation as the Agent may reasonably require to obtain and perfect its lien thereon. Each Company hereby irrevocably grants to the Agent a royalty-free, non-exclusive license in the General Intangibles, including trade names, Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, licenses, and any other proprietary and intellectual property rights and any and all right, title and interest in any of the foregoing, for the sole purpose, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, of having the right to advertise for sale and sell or transfer any Inventory bearing any of the General Intangibles, and apply the proceeds thereof to the Obligations hereunder, all as further set forth in this Financing Agreement and irrespective of the Agent's lien and perfection in any General Intangibles. SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 6.1. Each Company hereby warrants and represents that: i) the fair value of its assets exceed the book value of its liabilities; ii) such Company is generally able to pay its debts as they become due and payable; and iii) such Company does not have unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as it is currently conducted absent extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances. Each Company further warrants and represents that except for the Permitted Encumbrances and liens of which the Agent is aware on the date hereof, each of the security interests granted herein constitute and shall at all times constitute the first and only liens on the Collateral. Further, that except for the Permitted Encumbrances, each Company is or will be at the time additional Collateral is acquired by it, the absolute owner of the Collateral with full right to pledge, sell, consign, transfer and create a security interest therein, free and clear of any and all claims, consignments, or liens in favor of others, and that such Company will, at its expense, defend the same from any and all claims and demands (other than the Permitted Encumbrances) of any other person. 6.2. Each Company agrees to maintain accurate books and records pertaining to the Collateral. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Agent, accompanied by the Lenders or their respective agents may, from time to time (but no more than twice per fiscal year of the Companies) upon reasonable notice, enter upon each Company's premises at any time during normal business hours, or at such other times as the Agent and the Companies may agree upon, for the purpose of inspecting the Collateral and any and all records pertaining thereto, all at the Agent's and the applicable Lender's expense. During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent, accompanied by the Lenders or their respective agents may, at the Companies' expense, enter each Company's premises, -27-
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, and as often as the Agent deems reasonably necessary, to inspect the Collateral and the books and records of each Company. Each Company agrees to afford the Agent prior written notice of any change in the location of any Collateral, other than to locations that are known to the Agent and at which the Agent has otherwise fully perfected its liens thereon. Set forth on Schedule I hereto is a list of all of each Company's retail stores and the addresses of such stores. Each Company is also to advise the Agent promptly, in sufficient detail, of any material adverse change relating to the type, quantity or quality of the Collateral or on the security interests granted to the Agent therein. 6.3. [Intentionally Left Blank]. 6.4. Each Company agrees to comply with the requirements of all state and federal laws in order to grant to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders valid and perfected first security interests in the Collateral, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances. The Agent is hereby authorized by each Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to file any financing statements covering the Collateral whether or not the Company's signature appears thereon and the Agent agrees to provide the Companies with copies of such financing statements. Each Company hereby consents to and ratifies any and all execution and/or filing of financing statements on or prior to the Closing Date by the Agent. Each Company agrees to do whatever the Agent may reasonably request, from time to time, by way of: filing notices of liens, financing statements, amendments, renewals and continuations thereof; cooperating with the Agent's employees and agents; keeping Inventory stock records; transferring proceeds of Collateral to the Agent's possession in accordance with the terms of this Financing Agreement; and performing such further acts as the Agent on behalf of the Lenders may reasonably require in order to effect the purposes of this Financing Agreement. 6.5. Each Company agrees to i) maintain on Inventory, insurance under such policies of insurance, with such insurance companies, in such reasonable amounts and covering such insurable risks on as is reasonably acceptable to the Agent and ii) maintain or caused to be maintained on Real Estate and Equipment, insurance under such policies of insurance with such insurance companies selected by the Companies, on terms no less favorable than the insurance coverage in place as of the date hereof (other than with respect to the deductible amounts and limits of such coverage). All policies covering the Inventory are, subject to the rights of any holders of Permitted Encumbrances holding claims senior to the Agent, to be made payable to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under a standard non-contributory "mortgagee", "lender" or "secured party" clause and are to contain such other provisions as the Agent may reasonably require to fully protect by insurance the Agent's interest in the Inventory and to any payments to be made under such policies with respect to the Inventory. All original policies or true copies thereof or certificates thereof are to be delivered to the Agent, with all premiums current with the loss payable endorsement in the Agent's favor, and shall provide for not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the Agent of the exercise of any right of cancellation. If either Company fails to maintain such insurance, the Agent may arrange for such insurance, but at the Companies' expense and without any responsibility on the Agent's or any Lender's part for: obtaining the insurance, the solvency of the insurance companies, the adequacy of the coverage, or the collection of -28-
claims. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which is not waived, the Agent shall, subject to the rights of any holders of Permitted Encumbrances holding claims senior to the Agent, have the sole right, in the name of the Agent or either Company, to file claims under any insurance policies with respect to the Inventory, to receive, receipt and give acquittance for any payments that may be payable thereunder with respect to the Inventory, and to execute any and all endorsements, receipts, releases, assignments, reassignments or other documents that may be necessary to effect the collection, compromise or settlement of any claims with respect to the Inventory under any such insurance policies. In the event of any loss or damage by fire or other casualty, insurance proceeds relating to Collateral shall be deposited in the Depository Accounts in accordance with Section 3.4 of this Financing Agreement. 6.6. Each Company agrees to pay, when due, all local, domestic and foreign (as applicable) taxes, assessments, and other charges (herein "taxes") lawfully levied or assessed upon such Company or the Collateral, provided, however, that such taxes need not be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof if: i) such taxes are being diligently contested by the Companies in good faith and by appropriate proceedings; ii) the Companies establish such reserves as may be required by GAAP; iii) such taxes are not secured by a filed lien which is senior to the liens of the Agent on the Collateral and iv) such taxes secured by a filed lien are not due the United States of America. To prevent the imminent foreclosure of any tax liens (whether such liens are senior or junior to the liens of the Agent) or in the event the Agent on behalf of the Lenders is exercising its remedies as a secured creditor on Collateral, then the Agent may, on the Companies' behalf, pay any taxes then due and secured by a lien on the Collateral and the amount thereof shall be an Obligation secured hereby. 6.7. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.6 above, each Company: (a) agrees to comply with all acts, rules, regulations and orders of any legislative, administrative or judicial body or official, including, but not limited to, the Fair Labor Standards Act, as set forth in Section 201 through Section 219 of Title 29 of the United States Code, which the failure to comply with would have a materially adverse impact on the Collateral, or on the operation of the business of such Company, provided that the Companies may contest any acts, rules, regulations, orders and directions of such bodies or officials in any reasonable manner which will not materially adversely effect the Agent's liens or priority in the Collateral; and (b) agrees to comply with all environmental statutes, acts, rules, regulations or orders as presently existing or as adopted or amended in the future, applicable to the ownership and/or use of its Real Estate and operation of its business, which the failure to comply with would have a materially adverse impact on any material part of the Collateral, or on the operation of the business of either Company. The Companies shall not be deemed to have breached any provision of this Section 6.7 if (i) the failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.7 resulted from good faith error or innocent omission, (ii) the applicable Company promptly commences and diligently pursues a cure of such breach and such cure is eventually, within a reasonable time frame based upon the circumstances and the amount of work required, completed and (iii) such failure has not resulted in a materially adverse effect on any material portion of the Collateral or the business, financial condition or operations of either Company. -29-
6.8. Until termination of this Financing Agreement and satisfaction in full of all Obligations due hereunder, Big 5 agrees that, unless the Agent shall have otherwise consented in writing, Big 5 will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Agent, not later than: (a) one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year of Big 5, an audited Consolidated Balance Sheet as at the close of such year and consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, shareholders' equity and reconciliation of surplus of the Parent, Big 5 and their Subsidiaries for such year, audited by independent public accountants selected by Big 5 and satisfactory to the Agent, (the Agent hereby agrees that KPMG Peat Marwick is satisfactory to the Agent); (b) forty-five (45) days after the end of each month, other than a month that constitutes a fiscal year end, a Consolidated Balance Sheet as at the end of such period and consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Parent, Big 5 and their Subsidiaries for such period, certified by an authorized financial or accounting officer of Big 5; and (c) a reasonable time after request, such further information regarding the business affairs and financial condition of the Companies as the Agent may reasonably request, including, without limitation, annual cash flow projections in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

Notwithstanding anything in this Financing Agreement to the contrary, should the Parent purchase the assets of, or capital stock of, a Person, or create or incorporate another Person of which it owns a majority of such Person's capital stock, then the references to Consolidated Balance Sheet shall mean the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Big 5 and its Subsidiaries only and all references to Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, without further action, be immediately deleted from this Section 6.8. 6.9. Big 5 shall pay and satisfy in full the Senior Notes no later than December 22, 2004. 6.10. Until termination of this Financing Agreement and satisfaction of all Obligations due hereunder, each Company agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Agent, except as otherwise herein provided, such Company will not: A.

The change in the interest rate margins for the Term Loan will become effective the first Business Day after the Term Loan balance is reduced to $10,000,000 or less. Interest on the Revolving Loans and the Term Loan will be computed on a per annum basis, on the average of the net balances owing by the Companies in the Companies' account at the close of each day during such month. The Companies may elect to use Libor as to any new or then outstanding Revolving Loans or Term Loan portion provided x) there is then no Default or Event of Default, unless such Default or Event of Default has been waived in writing by Agent, and y) the Companies have so advised the Agent of their election to use Libor and the Libor Period selected no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed borrowing or, in the case of a Libor election with respect to a then outstanding Revolving Loan or Term Loan portion, three (3) Business Days prior to the conversion of any then outstanding Revolving Loans or Term Loan portions to Libor Loans and z) the election and Libor shall be effective, provided, there is then no unwaived Default or Event of Default, on the fourth Business Day following said notice. The Libor elections must be for $100,000 or whole multiples thereof. If no such election is timely made or can be made, then the Agent shall use the Chase Bank Rate and the applicable interest rate margin set forth above to compute interest. In the event of any change in the Chase Bank Rate, the interest rate hereunder shall change, as of the first day of the month following any change, so as to reflect the changed Chase Bank Rate. The rates hereunder shall be calculated based on a 365-day year. The Agent shall be entitled to charge the Companies' account at the rate provided for herein when due until all Obligation have been paid in full. Interest on the Term Loan will be for the ratable benefit of the Term Lenders and interest on the Revolving Loans will be for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Lenders. 7.4. In consideration of the Letter of Credit Guaranty, the Companies shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of Revolving Lenders, the Letter of Credit Guaranty Fee which shall be an amount equal to one and one-quarter percent (1 1/4%) per annum, payable monthly, on the face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit less the amount of any and all amounts previously drawn under such Letter of Credit. 7.5. Any charges, fees, commissions, costs and expenses charged to the Agent for either Company's account by any Issuing Bank in connection with or arising out of Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Financing Agreement or out of transactions relating thereto will be charged to the loan account in full when charged to or paid by the Agent and when made by any such Issuing Bank shall be conclusive on the Agent. 7.6. The Companies shall reimburse or pay the Agent, as the case may be, for: a) all Out-of-Pocket Expenses and b) any applicable Documentation Fees. 7.7. Upon the last Business Day of each month, commencing with December 31, 2004, the Companies shall pay the Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders the Line of Credit Fee. -39-
7.8. The Companies shall pay to the Agent all amounts under the Fee Letter on the Closing Date. 7.9. [Intentionally Left Blank]. 7.10. Immediately upon the advice to the Agent by the Companies of the Companies' election of a Libor Loan, the Companies shall pay to the Agent for the Agent's account only the Libor Processing Fee which shall be non-refundable. 7.11. The Companies shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders such amount or amounts as shall compensate the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants (as defined below), if any, for any loss, costs or expenses incurred by the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants if any, (as reasonably determined by the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants if any) as a result of: (i) any payment or prepayment on a date other than the last day of a Libor Period for such Libor Loan, or (ii) any failure of the Companies to borrow a Libor Loan on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice; such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to any loss or expense suffered by the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants if any, during the period from the date of receipt of such payment or prepayment or the date of such failure to borrow to the last day of such Libor Period if the rate of interest obtained by the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants if any, upon the reemployment of an amount of funds equal to the amount of such payment, prepayment or failure to borrow is less than the rate of interest applicable to such Libor Loan for such Libor Period. The determination by the Agent, the Lenders or their Participants, if any, of the amount of any such loss or expense, when set forth in a written notice to the Companies, containing the calculations thereof in reasonable detail, shall constitute prima facie evidence thereof. 7.12. The Companies may at any time, on ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to the Agent, reduce the Line of Credit provided that: (i) any reduction shall be permanent and irrevocable; (ii) a reduction must be for at least $5,000,000 or whole multiples thereof; and (iii) the Companies shall immediately repay the Agent the amount by which the Obligations exceed the amount of the Borrowing Base less the Availability Reserve. 7.13. Each Company hereby confirms and authorizes the Agent, and the Agent hereby agrees, to charge the loan account with the amount of all Obligations due hereunder as such payment becomes due. In the unlikely event the Agent is unable or unwilling to charge any such Obligation to the loan account, then the Agent shall so notify the Companies in writing and, without limiting any of the Agent's and Lenders' rights and remedies hereunder, the amount so requested shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after such demand. SECTION 8. POWERS Subject to the last paragraph in this Section 8, each Company hereby constitutes the Agent on behalf the Lenders or any person or agent the Agent may reasonably designate as its attorney-in-fact, at each Company's cost and expense, to exercise all of the following -40-
powers, which being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until all Obligations to the Agent and the Lenders have been satisfied and this Financing Agreement terminated: (a) To receive, take, endorse, sign, assign and deliver, all in the name of the Agent or such Company, any and all checks, notes, drafts, and other documents or instruments relating to the Collateral for i) deposit to a Blocked Account (consistent with the terms of Section 3.4 of this Financing Agreement) or ii) after the acceleration by the Agent of the Obligations for application to satisfaction of the Obligations consistent with the terms of Section 9.3 hereof; (b) To request, not more frequently than two (2) times per fiscal year, from customers indebted on Trade Accounts Receivable, in the name of such Company or the Agent's designee, information concerning the amounts owing on the Trade Accounts Receivable provided, however, that such request made be made only if the then aggregate balance of the Trade Accounts Receivable is in excess of $3,500,000; (c) To request from customers indebted on Trade Accounts Receivable at any time, in the name of the Agent, information concerning the amounts owing on the Trade Accounts Receivable; (d) To transmit to customers indebted on Trade Accounts Receivable notice of the Agent's interest therein and to notify customers indebted on Trade Accounts Receivable to make payment directly to the Agent for such Company's account; and (e) To take or bring, in the name of CITBC or such Company, all steps, actions, suits or proceedings reasonably deemed by CITBC necessary or desirable to enforce or effect collection of the Accounts. Notwithstanding anything hereinabove contained to the contrary, the powers set forth in (a), (c), (d) and (e) above may only be exercised after the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time as such Event of Default is waived. SECTION 9. EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES 9.1. Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, the Agent acting for the Lenders may terminate this Financing Agreement immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following (herein "Events of Default"): (a) cessation of business of either Company or the calling of a general meeting of the creditors of either Company for purposes of compromising the debts and obligations of such Company; (b) either Company admits in writing its inability to generally pay its debts as they mature; -41-
(c) the commencement by either Company of any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization, receivership or similar proceedings under any federal or state law; (d) the commencement against either Company of any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization, receivership or similar proceedings under any federal or state law provided, however, that such Default shall not be deemed an Event of Default if the proceeding, petition, case or arrangement is dismissed within sixty (60) days of the filing of, or the commencement of, such petition, case, proceeding or arrangement; (e) material breach by either Company of any warranty, representation (representations and warranties referred to in this subparagraph e shall be deemed made as of each i) Reporting Date, whether or not any report is in fact given to the Agent or ii) request for a Revolving Loan or iii) request for the Agent's assistance in obtaining a Letter of Credit or iv) the posting of any Obligation to the loan account) or any covenant contained herein (other than those otherwise referred to in this Section 9) or in any other agreement between either Company and the Agent relating to this Financing Agreement, provided that such Default by either Company of any of the warranties, representations or covenants referred to in this clause (e) shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default unless and until such Default shall remain unwaived or unremedied to the Agent's reasonable satisfaction for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of the Agent's discovery of such breach (the Agent shall endeavor to notify the Companies of such breach but the failure to so notify shall not detract from the Agent's rights or give the Companies any claim, course of action or defense); (f) breach by either Company of any warranty, representation or covenant of: i) the first sentence of Section 3.3; or ii) Section 3.4; or iii) Section 5.3; or iv) Section 6.5 (only as it relates to insurance on the Inventory); or v) Section 6.6; or vii) Section 6.10 (other than sub-paragraphs A (ii), B and F thereof); or Section 6.17; (g) breach by either Company of sub-paragraphs A (ii), B or F of Section 6.10, provided that such Default by either Company shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default unless and until such Default shall remain unwaived or unremedied for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such Default; (h) (i) failure of the Companies to pay when due any amounts in respect of the Term Loan, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 7.12 of this Financing Agreement, failure of the Companies to pay any other Obligations within ten (10) days of the due date thereof; (i) either Company shall (i) engage in any "prohibited transaction" as defined in ERISA, (ii) have any "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined in ERISA, (iii) have any Reportable Event as defined in ERISA, (iv) terminate any Plan, as defined in ERISA or (v) be engaged in any proceeding in which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation shall seek appointment, or is appointed, as trustee or administrator of any Plan, as defined in ERISA, and with respect to this sub-paragraph (i) such event or -42-
condition (x) remains uncured for a period of ninety (90) days from date of occurrence and (y) could reasonably be expected to subject that Company to any tax, penalty or other liability materially adverse to the business, operations or financial condition of such Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (j) either Company shall default in the payment of, or other performance under, any indenture or other instrument evidencing recourse Indebtedness of either Company in excess of $5,000,000, if as a result of such default, the maturity of any Indebtedness evidenced by any such indenture or instrument is accelerated prior to its stated maturity. 9.2. Upon the occurrence of a Default and/or an Event of Default, at the option of the Agent, all loans and advances provided for in Section 3.1 of this Financing Agreement shall be made thereafter in the Agent's sole discretion and the obligation of the Agent acting for the Lenders to make Revolving Loans and/or assist the Companies in obtaining Letters of Credit shall cease until such time as the Default is timely cured to the Agent's reasonable satisfaction or the Event of Default is waived. Further, at the option of the Agent, or at the direction of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (unless waived): (i) all Obligations shall upon notice (provided, however, that no such notice is required if the Event of Default is the Event of Default listed in Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(d)) become immediately due and payable; (ii) the Agent may thereafter charge the Companies the Default Rate of Interest on all then outstanding or thereafter incurred Obligations in lieu of the interest provided for in Section 7.1 of this Financing Agreement provided (a) the Agent has given the Companies written notice of the Event of Default, provided, however, that no notice is required if the Event of Default is the Event of Default listed in Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(d) and (b) the Companies have failed to cure the Event of Default within fifteen (15) days after (x) the Agent deposited such notice in the United States mail or (y) the occurrence of the Event of Default listed in Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(d); and iii) the Agent may, and shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, immediately terminate this Financing Agreement upon notice to the Companies, provided, however, that no notice of termination is required if the Event of Default is the Event of Default listed in Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(d). Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Agent waives all Events of Default, then by written notice to the Companies, the acceleration of the Obligations will be rescinded and all remedies and actions then being exercised by the Agent shall cease. The exercise of any option is not exclusive of any other option which may be exercised at any time by the Agent. 9.3. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Agent may, to the extent permitted by law: (a) remove from any premises where same may be located copies of any and all documents, instruments, files and records, relating to the Accounts, or the Agent may use such of each Company's personnel, supplies or space at each Company's places of business or otherwise, as may be necessary to properly administer and control the Accounts or the handling of collections and realizations thereon; (b) bring suit, in the name of either Company or the Agent, and generally shall have all other rights respecting said Accounts, including without limitation the right to: accelerate or extend the time of payment, settle, compromise, release in whole or in part, any amounts owing on any Accounts and issue credits in the name of either Company or the Agent; (c) sell, assign and -43-
deliver the Collateral and any returned, reclaimed or repossessed merchandise, with or without advertisement, at public or private sale, for cash, on credit or otherwise, at the Agent's sole option and discretion, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Agent may bid or become a purchaser at any such sale, free from any right of redemption, which right is hereby expressly waived by the Companies; (d) foreclose the security interests created herein by any available judicial procedure, or to take possession of any or all of the Inventory without judicial process, and to enter any premises where any Inventory may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the same; and (e) exercise any other rights and remedies provided in law, in equity, by contract or otherwise. The Agent shall have the right, without notice or advertisement, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral whether in its then condition or after further preparation or processing, in the name of either Company or the Agent, or in the name of such other party as the Agent may designate, either at public or private sale or at any broker's board, in lots or in bulk, for cash or for credit, with or without warranties or representations, and upon such other terms and conditions as the Agent in its sole discretion may deem advisable, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Agent shall have the right to purchase at any such sale. If any Inventory shall require repairing, maintenance or preparation, the Agent shall have the right, at its option, to do such of the aforesaid as is necessary, for the purpose of putting the Inventory in such saleable form as the Agent shall reasonably deem appropriate. Each Company agrees, at the request of the Agent, to assemble the Inventory and to make it available to the Agent at premises of the Companies or such other location reasonably designated by the Agent for the purpose of the Agent's taking possession of, removing or putting the Inventory in saleable form. However, if notice of intended disposition of any Collateral is required by law, it is agreed that ten (10) days notice shall constitute reasonable notification and full compliance with the law. The net cash proceeds resulting from the Agent's exercise of any of the foregoing rights, (after deducting all reasonable charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be applied by the Agent to the payment of the Obligations, whether due or to become due, and the Companies shall remain liable to the Agent for any deficiencies, and the Agent in turn agrees to remit to the Companies or their respective successors or assigns, any surplus resulting therefrom. The enumeration of the foregoing rights is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any right shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights, all of which shall be cumulative. 9.4. (a) Any payment by the Companies (including any payment made by the Companies by drawing on the Line of Credit) that the Companies designate as a payment of principal or interest on the Term Loan must be applied as follows: FIRST, unless the Agent otherwise elects in its sole discretion, to the payment of all Out-of-Pocket Expenses; and SECOND, to the Obligations owed to the Term Lenders. (b) All other payments by or on behalf of the Companies or from the proceeds of any Collateral must be applied as follows: FIRST, unless the Agent otherwise elects in its sole discretion, to the payment of all Out-of-Pocket Expenses; -44-
SECOND, to all Obligations owed to the Revolving Lenders (including the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding Obligations relating to Letters of Credit); THIRD, to the Obligations owed to the Term Lenders; FOURTH, to the payment of all other Obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Financing Documents otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST", "SECOND", and "THIRD," preceding; and FIFTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. (c) In carrying out the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category, (ii) amounts to be applied pursuant to clause (a) "SECOND" or clause (b) "SECOND" and "THIRD" shall be applied within such category first to fees, expenses, and costs payable under the Financing Documents, then to accrued and unpaid interest, then to outstanding principal and to pay or collateralize outstanding Obligations relating to Letters of Credit, and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause (b) "SECOND" preceding are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the bank(s) that issued the Letters of Credit for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations in the manner specified above. SECTION 10. TERMINATION Except as otherwise permitted herein, the Agent may, and shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, terminate this Financing Agreement and the Line of Credit only as of March 20, 2008 or any subsequent Anniversary Date and then only by giving the Companies at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may terminate the Financing Agreement immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default upon notice to the Companies, provided, however, that if the Event of Default is an event listed in Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(d) of this Financing Agreement, the Agent may, and shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, regard the Financing Agreement as terminated and notice to that effect is not required. This Financing Agreement, unless terminated as herein provided, shall automatically continue from Anniversary Date to Anniversary Date. The Companies may, at any time, terminate this Financing Agreement and the Line of Credit upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Agent, provided that the Companies pay to the Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders, concurrent with payment of the Obligations, the Early Termination Fee. All Obligations shall become due and payable as of any termination hereunder or under Section 9 hereof. All of the Agent's rights, liens and security interests shall continue after any termination until all Obligations have been satisfied in full. Pending payment in full of all Obligations, -45-
the Agent can withhold any credit balances in the loan account (unless supplied with an indemnity satisfactory to the Agent) to cover all of the Obligations, whether absolute or contingent, provided, however, that if the remaining unpaid Obligations arise solely out of the outstanding amounts of Letters of Credit, the Agent will, at the Companies' request, retain, solely as collateral, credit balances in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the then outstanding amounts of Letters of Credit unless the Companies provide the Agent with back-to-back letters of credit from a financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Agent, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Agent, in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the then outstanding amounts of Letters of Credit. When all other Obligations have been paid in full in cash and the outstanding amount of Letters of Credit have been so secured by cash or by the back-to-back letters of credit, in either event in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the then outstanding amounts of Letters of Credit pursuant to a fully executed agreement between the Agent and the Companies and pursuant to which the Companies agree to reimburse the Agent for any Letter of Credit claims that exceed the cash collateral or the back to back letters of credit, then for all purposes of this Financing Agreement, this Financing Agreement shall be treated by the parties hereto as terminated and all other Collateral will be released. No Early Termination Fee will accrue if the Revolving Line of Credit is terminated as a result of a refinancing led by the Agent. SECTION 11. AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LENDERS 11.1. (a) The Agent, for the account of the Lenders, shall disburse all loans and advances to the Companies and shall handle all collections of Collateral and repayment of Obligations. It is understood that for purposes of advances to the Companies and for purposes of this Section 11 the Agent is using the funds of the Agent. (b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to any advance to the Companies that such Lender will not make the amount which would constitute its share of the borrowing on such date available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Lender shall make such amount available to the Agent on a Settlement Date, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Companies a corresponding amount. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Lender on the Settlement Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to as appropriate, Revolving Loans or the Term Loan hereunder, on demand, from the Companies without prejudice to any rights which the Agent may have against such Lender hereunder. Nothing contained in this subsection shall relieve any Lender which has failed to make available its ratable portion of any borrowing hereunder from its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate Agent to make available to the Companies the full amount of a requested advance when the Agent has any notice (written or otherwise) that any of the Lenders will not advance its ratable portion thereof. 11.2. On the Settlement Date, the Agent and the Lenders shall each remit to the other, in immediately available funds, all amounts necessary so as to ensure that, as of -46-
the Settlement Date, the Revolving Lenders shall have their proportionate share of all outstanding Obligations in respect of the Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and the Term Lenders shall have their proportionate share of all outstanding Obligations in respect of the Term Loans. 11.3. The Agent shall forward to each Lender, at the end of each month, a copy of the account statement rendered by the Agent to the Company. 11.4. The Agent shall, after receipt of any interest and fees earned under this Financing Agreement, promptly remit to the Term Lenders and the Revolving Lenders, as appropriate, their pro rata portion of such interest and fees, provided, however, that the Lenders (other than CITBC in its role as Agent) shall not share in the fees set forth in the Fee Letter, Documentation Fees or Libor Processing Fee except as may have otherwise been agreed in writing between the Agent and the Lenders. 11.5. (a) Each Company acknowledges that the Lenders, with the consent of the Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, may sell participations in the loans and extensions of credit made and to be made to the Companies hereunder (the "Participants"), provided, however, that a Participant may not so purchase a participation in an amount less than $5,000,000 or the then aggregate amount of such Lender's interest in the loans and advances and extensions of credit hereunder. Each Company further acknowledges that in doing so, the Lenders may grant to such Participants certain rights which would require the Participant's consent to certain waivers, amendments and other actions with respect to the provisions of this Financing Agreement, provided that the consent of any such Participant shall not be required except for matters requiring the consent of all Lenders hereunder as set forth in Section 12.10 hereof. (b) The Company authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or purchasing lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the Companies and their affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Companies pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Companies in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of either Company and its affiliates prior to entering into this Agreement or the Prior Financing Agreement, provided, however, that prior to such disclosure to a then or potential Participant the Lender must first obtain from the then or potential Participant a confidentiality agreement in form and substance similar to the confidentiality paragraph of this Financing Agreement. 11.6. Each Company has made and will, from time to time, make available to the Agent and/or the Lenders certain financial and other business information (the "Confidential Information") relating to its business. By their signatures hereto or to the Assignment and Transfer Agreement, the Agent and each Lender agree to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information, and to disclose such information only (a) to officers, directors or employees of such Agent or Lender and their legal or financial advisors, in each case to the extent necessary to carry out this Financing Agreement and in the case of CITBC, to CIT Group Holdings, Inc., or CIT Group, Inc., and in the case of any other Lender, to such other Lender's parent organization, but only, in the case of all of the -47-
foregoing Persons referred to in this clause (a), after the Agent or the Lender, as the case may be, has advised each such Person to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, (b) to any other Person to the extent the disclosure of such information to such Person is required in connection with the examination of a Lender's records by appropriate authorities, pursuant to court order, subpoena or other legal process or otherwise as required by law or regulation, and (c) to Transferees or potential Transferees but only after such Transferees or potential Transferees have executed a written confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of this paragraph. The Lenders, the Agent, Transferees and potential Transferees shall not be required to maintain the confidentiality of any portion of the Confidential Information which (a) is known by such Person or its agents, advisors or representatives prior to disclosure or (b) becomes generally available to the public provided that the disclosure of such Confidential information does not violate a confidentiality agreement of which the Transferees, potential Transferees, the Agent or the Lender, as the case may be, has actual knowledge. 11.7. Each Company hereby agrees that each Lender is solely responsible for its portion of the Line of Credit or the Term Loan, as applicable, and that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for, nor assume any obligations for, the failure of any Lender to make available its portion of the Line of Credit or the Term Loan. Further, should any Lender refuse to make available its portion of the Line of Credit or the Term Loans, then another Lender may, but without obligation to do so, increase, unilaterally, its portion of the Line of Credit in which event the Companies are so obligated to that other Lender. 11.8. In the event that the Agent, the Lenders or any one of them is sued or threatened with suit by either Company, or by any receiver, trustee, creditor or any committee of creditors on account of any preference, voidable transfer or lender liability issue, alleged to have occurred or been received as a result of, or during the transactions contemplated under, this Financing Agreement, then in such event any money paid in satisfaction or compromise of such suit, action, claim or demand and any expenses, costs and attorneys' fees paid or incurred in connection therewith, whether by the Agent, the Lenders or any one of them, shall be shared proportionately by the Lenders. In addition, any costs, expenses, fees or disbursements incurred by outside agencies or attorneys retained by the Agent to effect collection or enforcement of any rights in the Collateral, including enforcing, preserving or maintaining rights under this Financing Agreement shall be shared proportionately between and among the Lenders to the extent not reimbursed by the Companies or from the proceeds of Collateral. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any (i) suits, actions, proceedings or claims that are unrelated, directly or indirectly, to this Financing Agreement, or (ii) costs, fees, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any Lender. 11.9. Each of the Lenders agrees with each other Lender that any money or assets of either Company held or received by such Lender, no matter how or when received, shall be applied to the reduction of the Obligations (to the extent permitted hereunder) after x) the occurrence of an Event of Default and y) the election by the Required Lenders to accelerate the Obligations. In addition, each Company authorizes, and the Lenders shall have the right, without notice, upon any amount becoming due and payable hereunder, to -48-
set-off and apply against any and all property held by, or in the possession of such Lender the Obligations due such Lenders. 11.10. CITBC shall have the right at any time to assign to one or more commercial banks, commercial finance lenders or other financial institutions all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Financing Agreement (including, without limitation, under its obligations the Line of Credit, the Revolving Loans, the Term Loan, and its rights and obligations with respect to Letters of Credit). In any event, CITBC shall retain for its own account an amount at least equal to a pro-rata share equal to the highest pro-rata share held by any Participant (other than the pro-rata share held by Bank of America, N.A.), and in no event less than 20% of the amount of the Obligations ("CITBC Hold Position"); provided, however, that such CITBC Hold Position shall cease while there is then an Event of Default and only until such Event of Default is waived. Should CITBC during an Event of Default assign additional interests, then the CITBC Hold Position shall be the remaining amount of CITBC's position if and when such Event of Default is waived. Upon execution of an Assignment and Transfer Agreement, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such assignment, have the rights and obligations of CITBC as the case may be hereunder and (ii) CITBC shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Financing Agreement. Each Company shall, if necessary, execute any documents reasonably required to effectuate the assignments. No other Lender may assign its interest, in whole or in part, in the loans and advances and extensions of credit hereunder without i) the prior written consent of the Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; ii) the payment to the Agent (solely for the Agent's account) by the current or prospective Lender of a $5,000 fee for processing the assignment; and (iii) if the Transferee is a Foreign Lender (as defined in Section 13.5 hereof), such Foreign Lender first complies with the provisions of Section 13.5 hereof provided, however, that the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) hereof shall not apply in connection with any assignment by a Lender to an affiliate of such Lender, or in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan portfolio of a Lender. Additionally, no other Lender shall assign such Lender's interest in the loans and advances and extensions of credit hereunder (or any portion thereof) unless the interest to be so assigned is either not less than $5,000,000 or all of such Lender's entire interest in the loans and advances and extensions of credit hereunder, except that such minimum assignment amount does not apply to an assignment of a Term Lender's interest in the Term Loan if, and to the extent that, the assignment is necessary to ensure that the assigning Term Lender's position in the Term Loan is not greater than CITBC's position in the Term Loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, prior to any such assignment and/or the disclosure of the Confidential Information, such Transferee, actual or potential, shall execute a confidentiality agreement in form and substance substantially similar to the confidentiality paragraph of this Financing Agreement. SECTION 12. AGENCY 12.1. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints CITBC as the Agent for the Lenders under the Financing Documents and irrevocably authorizes -49-
CITBC as Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Financing Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into Financing Agreement and the ancillary documents or otherwise exist against the Agent. 12.2. The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. 12.3. Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, or attorneys-in-fact shall be (i) liable to any Lender for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in connection with the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents (except for its or such person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by either Company or any officer thereof contained in the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by, the Agent under or in connection with the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents or for any failure of the Companies to perform their obligations thereunder. The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Companies. 12.4. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Companies), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence from all of the Lenders, or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Financing Agreement and all ancillary documents in accordance with a request from all of the Lenders, or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. -50-
12.5. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Companies describing such Default or Event of Default. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until the Agent shall have received such direction, the Agent may in the interim (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Lenders. 12.6. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Companies, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Companies and made its own decision to enter into this Financing Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Financing Agreement and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Companies. The Agent, however, shall provide the Lenders with copies of all inventory confirmation statements, Collateral examinations and/or reviews, financial statements, projections and business plans which come into the possession of the Agent or any of its officers, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact. Further, the Agent shall use reasonable efforts to give the Lenders reasonable prior notice of the date of the Agent's visit to either Company's premises for purposes of inspecting the Collateral and books and records pertaining thereto. 12.7. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Companies and without limiting the obligation of the Companies to do so), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever (including negligence on the part of the Agent) which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in anyway relating to or arising out of this Financing Agreement on any ancillary documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the payment of the obligations. -51-
12.8. The Agent may make loans to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Companies as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder. With respect to its loans made or renewed by it or loan obligations hereunder as Revolving Lender and Term Lender, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers, duties and liabilities under the Financing Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not the Agent and the terms "Revolving Lender," "Term Lender," "Lender," and "Lenders" shall include the Agent in its individual capacities. 12.9. The Agent may resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Lenders and such resignation shall be effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent. If the Agent shall resign as Agent, then the Lenders shall appoint a successor agent for the Lenders whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Financing Agreement, provided, however, that the Lenders shall: (a) notify the Companies of the successor Agent and (b) request the consent of the Companies to such successor Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Companies shall be deemed to have consented to the successor Agent if the Lenders do not receive from the Companies, within ten (10) days of the Lenders' notice to the Companies, a written statement of the Companies' objection to the successor Agent. Should the Companies not consent and no acceptable successor Agent is agreed upon within thirty (30) days of the date the Companies advised the Lenders of their objection to the successor Agent, then the Lenders may appoint (without the Companies' consent) another successor Agent. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent the provisions of this Section 14 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent. 12.10. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Financing Agreement to the contrary, the Agent will not, without the prior written consent of all Lenders: (a) amend the Financing Agreement to (v) increase the rate of advance against Eligible Inventory as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Financing Agreement (provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the making of Overadvances pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof with the consent of and on the terms agreed to by Required Lenders) or increase the Line of Credit or the Term Loan; (w) reduce the interest rates; (x) reduce or waive (i) any fees in which the Lenders share hereunder; or (ii) the repayment of any Obligations due Lenders; (y) extend the maturity of the Obligations; or (z) alter or amend (1) this Section 12.10, (2) Section 9.4, or (3) the definitions of Eligible Inventory, Collateral or Required Lenders, or the Agent's criteria for determining compliance with such definitions of eligibility; (b) release or permit or consent to liens on Collateral with an aggregate value greater than $5,000,000 without a corresponding reduction in the Obligations to the Lenders, or (c) intentionally make any Revolving Loan or assist in opening any Letter of Credit hereunder if after giving effect thereto the total of Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder for the Companies would exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the maximum amount available under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. In all other respects and except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in this Financing Agreement, the Agent is authorized to take such actions or fail to take such actions if the Agent, in its reasonable discretion, deems such to be advisable and in the best interest of the Lenders, including, but not limited to, the termination of the -52-
Financing Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, unless it is specifically instructed to the contrary by the Required Lenders. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Financing Documents, any amendment of the terms of the Financing Documents requires the written consent of the Required Lenders or such greater percentage as may be required by the terms of the Financing Documents. 12.11. Each Lender agrees that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of this Financing Agreement any Revolving Lender may terminate this Financing Agreement or the Line of Credit only as of the fourth or any subsequent Anniversary Date and then only by giving the Agent one hundred and twenty (120) days prior written notice thereof. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of any such termination notice, the Agent shall, at its option, either (i) give notice of termination to the Companies hereunder or (ii) purchase the Lender's share of the Obligations hereunder for the full amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon. Unless so terminated this Financing Agreement and the Line of Credit shall be automatically extended from Anniversary Date to Anniversary Date. 12.12. Each Lender acknowledges that (i) Agent is the agent for both the Revolving Lenders and the Term Lenders, (ii) CITBC holds a larger share of the Term Loan Commitments than the Revolving Loans Commitments, and (iii) there is a conflict between the duties of the Agent for and on behalf of the Term Lenders and duties of the Agent for and on behalf of the Revolving Lenders. Each Lender hereby waives any conflict of interest which the Agent may have as a result of the foregoing and agrees that the Agent shall have no liability to any Lender based upon CITBC's exercise of its duties as Agent hereunder and its position as a Revolving Lender and a Term Lender; provided however that such waiver shall not extend to actions by CITBC that constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS 13.1. Except as otherwise expressly provided, each Company hereby waives diligence, demand, presentment and protest and any notices thereof as well as notice of nonpayment, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration. No delay or omission of the Agent or the Companies to exercise any right or remedy hereunder, whether before or after the happening of any Event of Default, shall impair any such right or shall operate as a waiver thereof or as a waiver of any such Event of Default. No single or partial exercise by the Agent of any right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise thereof, or precludes any other right or remedy. 13.2. Neither this Financing Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except as pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Companies, the Agent, the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as the case may be. 13.3. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS REFERENCED HEREIN OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL -53-
AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES. EACH COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE SECURITY INTEREST GRANTED BY IT PURSUANT TO THE PRIOR FINANCING AGREEMENT (AND MAINTAINED PURSUANT TO THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT) CONTINUES (WITHOUT INTERRUPTION) IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT IN FAVOR OF THE AGENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF LENDERS. UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PRIOR FINANCING AGREEMENT ARE HEREBY AMENDED AND RESTATED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT. 13.4. It is the intent of the Companies, the Agent and the Lenders to conform strictly to all applicable state and federal usury laws. All agreements between the Companies and the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity hereof or otherwise, shall the amount contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money loaned hereunder or otherwise, or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other document evidencing, securing or pertaining to the Obligations evidenced hereby which may be legally deemed to be for the use, forbearance or detention of money, exceed the maximum amount which the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, is legally entitled to contract for, charge or collect under applicable state or federal law. If from any circumstance whatsoever fulfillment of any provisions hereof or of such other documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then the obligations to be fulfilled shall be automatically reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any such circumstance the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, shall ever receive as interest or otherwise an amount in excess of the maximum that can be legally collected, then such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal indebtedness hereof and any other amounts due with respect to the Obligations evidenced hereby, but not to the payment of interest and if such amount which would be excessive interest exceeds the Obligations and all other non-interest indebtedness described above, then such additional amount shall be refunded to the Companies. In determining whether or not all sums paid or agreed to be paid by the Companies for the use, forbearance or detention of the Obligations of the Companies to the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, under any specific contingency, exceeds the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, the Companies and the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (a) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as sums paid or agreed to be paid by the Companies for the use, forbearance or detention of the Obligations of the Companies to the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof, and (c) to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal parts, the total amount of all sums paid or agreed to be paid by the Companies for the use, forbearance or detention of the Obligations of the Companies to the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders, throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations so that the interest rate is uniform throughout the entire term of the Obligations. The terms and provisions of this paragraph -54-
shall control and supersede every other provision hereof and all other agreements between the Companies and the Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders. 13.5. Any Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States (a "Foreign Lender") shall deliver to Agent and the Companies (i) two valid, duly completed copies of IRS Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, and any other required form, certifying in each case that such Foreign Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Financing Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, or (ii) if such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c) (3) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code and cannot deliver either IRS Form 1001 or 4224 pursuant to clause (i) above, (A) a duly completed certificate of non-withholding acceptable to the Companies and the Agent in their reasonable discretion (any such certificate, a "Tax Certificate") and (B) two valid, duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each such Foreign Lender shall also deliver to Agent and the Companies two further copies of said Form 1001 or 4224 or Form W-8 and a Tax Certificate, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of required certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or otherwise is required to be resubmitted as a condition to obtaining an exemption from a required withholding of United States of America federal income tax or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Companies and Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Companies and Agent, certifying (x) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224 that such Foreign Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Financing Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, or (y) in the case of a Form W-8 and a Tax Certificate, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. 13.6. If any provision hereof or of any other agreement made in connection herewith is held to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable, and the remaining provisions of the applicable agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such provision's severance. Furthermore, in lieu of any such provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of the applicable agreement a legal and enforceable provision as similar in terms to the severed provision as may be possible. 13.7. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COMPANIES, THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT. EACH COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS AND CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST EITHER COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS, THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT, EACH COMPANY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION -55-
WITH ITS PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FINANCING AGREEMENT. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST EITHER COMPANY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. EACH COMPANY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY ACTION INSTITUTED HEREUNDER AND SHALL NOT ASSERT ANY DEFENSE BASED ON LACK OF JURISDICTION OF VENUE OR BASED UPON FORUM NON CONVENIENS. 13.8. Except as otherwise herein provided, any notice or other communication required hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered when hand delivered, including overnight delivery by a courier service or sent by facsimile, or five days after deposit in the United States mails, with proper first class postage prepaid and addressed to the party to be notified as follows: A. if to CITBC or the Agent, at: The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. 300 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90071 Attn: Retail Credit Manager Facsimile Number: (213) 613-2599 with a copy to: Jenkens & Gilchrist, LLP 12100 Wilshire Blvd., 15th Floor Los Angeles, CA 90025 Attn: Gary Samson, Esq.

Each Company jointly and severally agrees to pay, and shall be jointly and severally liable under this Agreement for, all of the Obligations, regardless of the manner or amount in which proceeds of loans are used, allocated, shared, or disbursed by or among the Companies themselves, or the manner in which the Agents and/or any Lender accounts for such loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records. Each Company shall be liable for all amounts due to the Agents and/or any Lender under this Financing Agreement, regardless of which Company actually receives loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or the amount of such loans and extensions of credit received or the manner in which the Agents and/or such Lender accounts for such loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records.

REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE $[_________] Dated as of December __, 2004 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned (herein individually a "Company" and collectively the "Companies"), hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely and unconditionally promise to pay to the order of [__________________] (hereinafter, including its successors and permitted assigns, "Payee") with offices located at [____________________], in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, the principal amount of [______________________] Dollars ($[__________]), or such other principal amount as is advanced pursuant to Section 3.1 and Section 4.1 of the Financing Agreement (as herein defined). Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement, the Revolving Loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by the Companies. A final balloon payment in an amount equal to the outstanding aggregate balance of principal and interest remaining unpaid, if any, under this Note as shown on the books and records of the Agent shall be due and payable on the termination of the Financing Agreement. The Companies, jointly and severally, further absolutely and unconditionally promise to pay to Payee, in the manner provided in the Financing Agreement, interest, in like money, on the unpaid principal amount owing hereunder from time to time from the date hereof on the dates and at the rates specified in Section 7 of the Financing Agreement. If any payment on this Note becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. This Note is one of the Revolving Loan Promissory Notes referred to in the Second Amended and Restated Financing Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, as the same may be amended and restated and in effect from time to time, among the Companies, the Agent, Payee and the other financial institutions party thereto from time to time (the "Financing Agreement"), and is subject to, and entitled to, all of the terms, provisions and benefits thereof and is subject to optional and mandatory prepayment, in whole or in part, as provided therein. All initially capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning provided therefor in the Financing Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein. The date and amount of the advance(s) made hereunder may be recorded on the grid page or pages that may be attached hereto and made part of this Note or the separate ledgers maintained by the Agent. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances made pursuant hereto may be set forth in the balance column on said grid page or such ledgers maintained by the Agent. All such advances, whether or not so recorded, shall be due as part of this Note. The Companies confirm that any amount received by or paid to the Agent in connection with the Financing Agreement and/or any balances standing to its credit on any of its or their accounts on the Agent's books under the Financing Agreement may in accordance with the terms 1
of the Financing Agreement be applied in reduction of this Note, but no balance or amounts shall be deemed to effect payment in whole or in part of this Note unless the Agent shall have actually charged such account or accounts for the purposes of such reduction or payment of this Note. Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default specified in the Financing Agreement or upon termination of the Financing Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this Note may become, or be declared to be, immediately due and payable as provided in the Financing Agreement. Each of the undersigned further agrees to pay all expenses, including attorneys' fees and legal expenses, incurred by the holder of this Note in endeavoring to collect any amounts payable hereunder that are not paid when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise. This Note shall be construed under and governed by the laws of the State of California. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COMPANIES, PAYEE AND THE AGENT HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTE.

EXHIBIT 99.4 Contacts: Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Charles Kirk Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (310) 536-0611 John Mills Integrated Corporate Relations, Inc. (310) 395-0259 BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES PENDING REDEMPTION OF REMAINING SENIOR NOTES AND COMPLETION OF AMENDED CREDIT FACILITY EL SEGUNDO, CA -- DECEMBER 17, 2004 -- Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Big 5 Corp., will redeem on December 22 the remaining $23.1 million of principal amount of its 10.875% senior notes due 2007 by using funds available under an amended credit facility which was finalized on December 15. The amended credit facility provides for a new $20 million term loan facility and a $140 million revolving credit facility. In addition to the $23.1 million redemption, the Company previously reported that it had issued a notice to redeem $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10.875% senior notes on November 30, 2004, and this redemption was completed as planned. The completion of these two transactions will result in the redemption of all of the Company's remaining senior notes, consistent with the Company's previously announced plans. The notes had an original face amount of $131 million when issued in November 1997. As previously announced, the Company estimates that the two redemptions will result in annualized interest expense savings of approximately $1.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis, based on current interest rates. The notes will be redeemed at 101.825% of their face value, and taking into account the write-off of unamortized financing fees and original issue discount, the Company will recognize a resulting after-tax charge associated with both redemptions of approximately $650,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the 2004 fourth fiscal quarter. "After completion of this transaction, we will have redeemed all of our senior notes, including over $103 million since our initial public offering in June 2002," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The use of cash generated from our strong operating results and borrowings under lower-cost credit facilities to redeem our high cost senior notes significantly adds to our earnings and reflects our continuing commitment to bottom-line performance."

     Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported net sales for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2005, which included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively. Fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks for accounting purposes, with the extra week included in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter results.
El Segundo, CA  January 11, 2005 
     For the 14 weeks ended January 2, 2005, net sales increased 13.4% to $217.6 million from $191.8 million for the corresponding 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. On a comparative 13-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003, net sales increased 6.0% and same store sales increased 2.6% when calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The 2.6% same store sales increase represented the Company's 36 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons. Excluding the effect of a sales return allowance which was implemented in the fiscal third quarter of 2004, same store sales increased 3.1% versus the same 13-week quarter last year. Management uses this measure to analyze the Company's performance without regard to the extra week of sales in fiscal 2004 and the effect of the implementation of the sales return allowance and believes this presentation will provide investors with additional insight into the Company's operating results and a more consistent basis for comparing the Company's current operating results with those of prior periods.
th
     For the 53 weeks ended January 2, 2005, net sales increased 9.8% to $778.9 million from $709.7 million for the corresponding 52-week fiscal year in 2003. On a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003, net sales increased 7.8% and same store sales increased 3.5% when calculated in accordance with GAAP. Excluding the effect of a sales return allowance which was implemented in the fiscal third quarter of 2004, same store sales increased 3.9% versus the same 52-week period last year.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liability under that Section. Furthermore, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     On February 9, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for its fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 and the matters discussed under Item 4.02 below. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     (a) On February 8, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of management and the Audit Committee and in consultation with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 should not be relied upon because of errors in those financial statements and that the Company would restate these financial statements to make the necessary accounting corrections.
     In the course of its annual year-end closing process, the Company identified an error in an account within accounts payable as reported in its financial statements. This account reflects as credits items received into inventory at the Company's distribution center. Credits in this accounts payable account are cleared as the Company's receiving documentation is matched against vendor invoices or, in the case of inventory paid for by prior draws on letters of credit, commercial invoices. The process of clearing credits related to commercial invoices involves matching those credits in the accounts payable account against corresponding items, in a separate accounts payable contraliability account, which were previously entered at the time draws were made against letters of credit.
     The error occurred when certain credits in the accounts payable account related to commercial invoices were not matched on a timely basis with the corresponding letter of credit items in the contra-liability account as required by the Company's established accounting procedures. Certain of the Company's accounting personnel failed to understand that, even though vendors had already been paid by prior draws on letters of credit and inventories had been properly accounted for, timely reconciliation of all related commercial invoices still was necessary for proper internal bookkeeping. This failure created unmatched credits in accounts payable for each of the Company's 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 fiscal years, which were erroneously assumed to be over-accruals. These assumed over-accruals were reversed at year end and included in net income. This resulted in an understatement of accounts payable and an overstatement of net income, as well as a corresponding overstatement of stockholders' equity, for each of these periods.
     As a result, the Company's management and the Audit Committee have recommended, and its Board of Directors has approved, the review and restatement of its financial statements for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. The preliminary financial statements set forth in Exhibit 99.2 include adjustments that resulted from changes to address the matters described above. The impact on net income is expected to be $1.2 million for 2001, $2.1 million for 2002 and $1.4 million for 2003. The preliminary financial statements set forth in Exhibit 99.2 are being reviewed by the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm and could change. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to rely on the Company's historical financial statements for such periods.
     The non-cash adjustments of net income will not have any impact on (i) the Company's previously reported net sales or same store sales; (ii) the Company's previously reported assets, including cash; (iii) the

Company's previously reported cash flows from operating activities; or (iv) the Company's compliance with any financial covenant contained in its bank credit agreement. The Company also anticipates a refund or credit of approximately $3.2 million attributable to an over-payment of income taxes for the affected periods.
     The Company and its Audit Committee are, in consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, reviewing prior reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if any other adjustments or corrections are necessary. The Company has not identified any other necessary adjustments at this time. The Company has also corrected its internal controls associated with the accounting adjustments described herein. Management brought this situation to the attention of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors as soon as it became aware of it and its potential effect on the Company's financial statements, and is working with the Audit Committee and KPMG LLP, to review those effects and to take appropriate corrective action.
     The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has discussed the matters disclosed in this report with KPMG LLP, its independent registered public accounting firm.

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) today reported preliminary financial results for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and full year that ended on January 2, 2005.
El Segundo, CA  February 9, 2005 
For the 2004 14-week fiscal fourth quarter, net sales increased by $25.8 million, or 13.4%, to $217.6 million from $191.8 million in the corresponding 13-week fourth quarter of 2003. On a comparative 13-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003, net sales increased 6.0% and same store sales increased 2.6%. The 2.6% same store sales increase represented the Company's thirty-sixth consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales over comparable prior periods and includes a 0.5% negative impact from the effect of a sales return allowance that was implemented in the fiscal third quarter of 2004. Net income for the 2004 fourth quarter increased to $11.6 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with net income, as preliminarily restated, of $8.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income for the 2004 fourth fiscal quarter includes a charge of $0.8 million, net of taxes, or $0.03 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $33.1 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes, and net income for the 2003 fourth fiscal quarter includes a charge of $1.2 million, net of taxes, or $0.06 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $35.0 million principal amount of these notes.
For fiscal 2004, which included 53 weeks, net sales increased by $69.2 million, or 9.8%, to $778.9 million from $709.7 million for the corresponding 52-week fiscal year 2003. On a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003, net sales increased 7.8% and same store sales increased 3.5%. The 3.5% same store sales increase includes a 0.4% negative impact from the effect of a sales return allowance that was implemented in the fiscal third quarter of 2004. Net income for fiscal 2004 increased to $34.2 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, compared with net income for fiscal 2003, as preliminarily restated, of $24.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share. Net income for fiscal 2004 includes a charge of $1.3 million, net of taxes, or $0.06 per diluted share, associated with the
 
redemption of $48.1 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes, and net income for fiscal 2003 includes a charge of $2.1 million, net of taxes, or $0.09 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $55.0 million principal amount of these notes.
Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to report the continuation of our consistently strong performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004. We are particularly pleased to have achieved our fourth quarter results despite unseasonably warm and dry weather in the majority of our markets during the weeks preceding Christmas, which negatively impacted our winter categories. Our apparel category was down in the low single digits for the quarter, but that softness was more than offset by our performance in the hardgoods category, which was up in the low single digits, and our performance in the footwear category, which was up in the mid-to-high single digit range. Our ability to consistently generate significant cash flow from operations, combined with our significant borrowing capacity under our bank facility, enabled us during the fourth quarter to pay off the remaining $33.1 million of our 10.875% senior notes, which had an original principal amount of $131.0 million in 1997. We believe we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2005."
Big 5's results are preliminary because, during the course of the year-end closing process, the Company identified the need to correct prior period reconciliations of certain accounts within its accounts payable. Management has made an internal evaluation of the resulting impact and has included preliminary financial results reflecting these estimates. In addition, Big 5 and its Audit Committee are, in consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, reviewing prior financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if any other adjustments or corrections are necessary. Big 5 has not identified any other necessary adjustments at this time.
Accounting Restatements
In the course of its annual year-end closing process, Big 5 identified an error in an account within accounts payable as reported in its financial statements. This account reflects as credits items received into inventory at Big 5's distribution center. Credits in this accounts payable account are cleared as the Company's receiving documentation is matched against vendor invoices or, in the case of inventory paid for by prior draws on letters of credit, commercial invoices. The process of clearing credits related to commercial invoices involves matching those credits in the accounts payable account against corresponding items, in a separate accounts payable contraliability account, which were previously entered at the time draws were made against letters of credit.
The error occurred when certain credits in the accounts payable account related to commercial invoices were not matched on a timely basis with the corresponding letter of credit items in the contra-liability account as required by Big 5's established accounting procedures. Certain of the Company's accounting personnel failed to understand that, even though vendors had already been paid by prior draws on letters of credit and inventories had been properly accounted for, timely reconciliation of all related commercial invoices still was necessary for proper internal bookkeeping. This failure created unmatched credits in accounts payable for each of the Company's 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 fiscal years, which were erroneously assumed to be over-accruals. These assumed over-accruals were reversed at year end and included in net income. This resulted in an understatement of accounts payable and an overstatement of net income, as well as a corresponding overstatement of stockholders' equity, for each of these periods.
As a result, Big 5's management and its Audit Committee have recommended, and its Board of Directors has approved, the review and restatement of its financial statements for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. The accompanying preliminary financial statements include adjustments that resulted from changes to address the matters described above. The expected impact on net income is $1.2 million for 2001, $2.1 million for 2002 and $1.4 million
 
for 2003. The attached preliminary financial statements are being reviewed by the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm and could change. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to rely on the Company's historical financial statements for such periods.
These non-cash adjustments of net income do not have any impact on:
Additionally, the Company anticipates a refund or credit of approximately $3.2 million attributable to an over-payment of income taxes for the affected periods.
"While our prior fiscal year 2004 full year and fourth quarter guidance was impacted by $0.06 per share, these accounting adjustments do not affect the Company's underlying business or business prospects," explained Charles Kirk, Big 5's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We have corrected our internal controls associated with these accounting adjustments. Further, as all public companies are doing at this time, we are in the process of completing a full review of our internal controls as dictated by Sarbanes-Oxley requirements. Management brought this situation to the attention of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors as soon as it became aware of it and its potential effect on the Company's financial statements, and is working with the Audit Committee and KPMG LLP, to review those effects and to take appropriate corrective action. We anticipate the review of this matter will be concluded promptly and permit a timely filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004."
Declaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend
Big 5 also announced that its Board of Directors has voted to declare a cash dividend, at an annual rate of $0.28 per share of outstanding common stock. The next quarterly dividend, of $0.07 per share, will be paid on March 15, 2005, to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2005.
Store Openings
During the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, Big 5 opened 11 new stores, including three each in Arizona, California and Colorado, and one each in New Mexico and Utah. These openings brought the Company's year-end store count to 309 versus 293 at the end of fiscal 2003. The Company anticipates opening between 16 and 20 stores in fiscal 2005.
EPS Guidance
Big 5 expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range for the first fiscal quarter of 2005, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. For the 2005 fiscal year, the Company currently expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.70 to $1.80. This full-year guidance excludes $0.09 per diluted share associated with expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center, most of which are expected to be incurred in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005. The Company now anticipates total capital expenditures for its new distribution center to be approximately $22.5 million, of which $8.2 million has been expended through fiscal 2004.

Big 5 will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific) to discuss financial results for the quarter and full year ended January 2, 2005. The webcast will be available at www.big5sportinggoods.com and archived for three months.

see
 
 
 
     The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liability under that Section. Furthermore, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     On April 4, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its preliminary same-store sales results for its fiscal 2005 first quarter and the matters disclosed under Item 4.02 and Item 8.01 below. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     (a) As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 9, 2005 (the "February Current Report"), the Company determined that it would restate its previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002. In order to most accurately record the correction of the accounting error in an account within accounts payable reported by the Company in its February Current Report, the Company and its Audit Committee have decided to restate the Company's quarterly financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003, in addition to the fiscal year periods. The Company also will adjust its previously reported fiscal 2004 quarterly financial statements to reflect these restatements and the other adjustments described below, and expects that the net impact of all adjustments on fiscal 2004 will be a slight increase in earnings per diluted share from those previously reported. Consequently, the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's quarterly financial statements for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 should also not be relied upon because of errors in those financial statements. The Company will amend its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 to reflect the restatements.
     As a result of the Company's decision to restate on a quarterly basis, the Company also will make adjustments to its prior period financial statements for the previously disclosed charge in the fiscal 2004 third quarter relating to the establishment of an allowance for estimated sales returns. The Company will reverse the charge to the fiscal 2004 third quarter financial statements and reflect the allowance on a quarterly basis in the individual financial statements for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. This adjustment is expected to add approximately $0.02 to the Company's previously reported earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2004 and to reduce earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2002 by $0.01. This adjustment is not expected to change earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2003.
     Also, like many other companies in the retail, restaurant and other industries, the Company has decided in connection with the restatements to make certain changes to its accounting treatment for leases following the February 7, 2005 letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chief Accountant clarifying the Commission staff's interpretation of certain lease accounting issues. To reflect these lease accounting changes, which will be described in detail in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005, the Company will make adjustments to its prior reported quarterly financial statements for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004. These adjustments are not expected to impact net income by more than $125,000, or 0.5% of net income, for any fiscal year. These adjustments are not expected to change earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2002 or 2004, and are expected to reduce fiscal 2003 earnings per diluted share by $0.01.
     As a result of the accounting error and restatement of financial statements to correct that error described above, the Company has determined that it has an internal control deficiency that constitutes a "material weakness," as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 2. Consequently, management will be unable to conclude that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of January 2, 2005. An assessment of the Company's internal controls will be
 
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Company management has corrected and enhanced its policies and procedures to reasonably assure remediation of this material weakness.
     The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with KPMG LLP, its independent registered public accounting firm.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On April 4, 2005, the Company announced that it did not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 4, 2005, the extended deadline established in the Company's Form 12b-25 filing with the Commission on March 18, 2005. Due to the amount of additional work associated with the restatements described in Item 4.02 above, the Company's financial statements and the associated audit have not been able to be completed in order to permit a timely filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to be able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K within the next few weeks.

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported that it achieved its 37 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales performance for the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2005. The Company expects to report, based upon preliminary sales results, a same store sales increase of approximately 1.7% for the first fiscal quarter versus the comparable 13-week period of 2004.

th
"We are pleased to have maintained our consistent same store sales performance and to report our 37 consecutive quarter of comp store sales increases," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our solid comp store performance was achieved despite operating with one less business day during the quarter as a consequence of Easter shifting into the first quarter this year. Additionally, we were able to overcome unfavorable weather conditions in our markets during the quarter, including unusually dry weather in the Pacific Northwest and near-record rainfall in Southern California."
th
The Company also reported that it would not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 4, 2005, the extended deadline established in the Company's Form 12b-25 filing.
In order to most accurately record the correction of the accounting error disclosed by the Company in its February 9, 2005 press release, the Company and its Audit Committee have decided to restate the Company's quarterly financial statements for 2002 and 2003, in addition to the fiscal year periods. The Company does not expect that its audited financial statements for fiscal 2002 or 2003, as restated to correct the accounting error and to include the other adjustments described below, will be materially different from the preliminarily
 
restated financial statements that the Company included in its February 9 press release. The Company also will adjust its previously reported fiscal 2004 quarterly financial statements to reflect these restatements and the other adjustments described below, and expects that the net impact of all adjustments on fiscal 2004 will be a slight increase in earnings per diluted share from those previously reported.
As a result of the Company's decision to restate on a quarterly basis, the Company also will make adjustments to its prior period financial statements for the previously disclosed charge in the fiscal 2004 third quarter relating to the establishment of an allowance for estimated sales returns. The Company will reverse the charge to the fiscal 2004 third quarter financial statements and reflect the allowance on a quarterly basis in the individual financial statements for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. This adjustment is expected to add approximately $0.02 to the Company's previously reported earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2004 and to reduce earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2002 by $0.01. This adjustment is not expected to change earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2003.

To reflect these lease accounting changes, which will be described in detail in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company will make adjustments to its prior reported quarterly financial statements for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004. These adjustments are not expected to impact net income by more than $125,000, or 0.5% of net income, for any fiscal year. These adjustments are not expected to change earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2002 or 2004, and are expected to reduce fiscal 2003 earnings per diluted share by $0.01.
Due to the amount of additional work associated with the restatements described above, the Company's financial statements and the associated audit have not been able to be completed in order to permit a timely filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to be able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K within the next few weeks.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On April 7, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") received notice of a determination by Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that the Company fails to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) for continued listing due to the delayed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 and that its securities are therefore subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market. The Company intends to appeal the Staff's determination to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, which will stay the delisting until the appeal has been heard and the Panel has rendered its decision. In connection with this appeal and pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4820, the Company intends to submit a written request for hearing to Nasdaq's Office of Listing Qualifications Hearings. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported preliminary financial results for the fiscal 2005 first quarter that ended on April 3, 2005.
El Segundo, CA  May 4, 2005 
For the fiscal 2005 first quarter, net sales increased by $8.1 million, or 4.5%, to $189.9 million from net sales, as preliminarily restated to include adjustments relating to the previously announced establishment of a sales return reserve, of $181.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. Same store sales increased 1.7% during the first fiscal quarter versus the comparable 13-week period last year, representing the Company's 37 consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales over comparable prior periods. Net income increased to $7.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared with net income, as preliminarily restated, of $6.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2004 first quarter.
th
"We are pleased to report a strong start to our fiscal 2005," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We operated with one less business day during the quarter due to the shift in the timing of the Easter holiday and overcame unfavorable weather conditions in a majority of our markets to achieve our 37 consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales. We were up in each of our three major merchandise categories for the quarter, with footwear being our strongest performing category, followed by apparel and hardgoods. We believe that we are well positioned to continue our consistently solid performance in the second quarter and throughout the year."

Big 5 Sporting Goods 2-2-2
The Company previously announced that it would restate its prior reported financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and the quarterly periods of fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004, in order to correct an accounting error and to make adjustments relating to the previously disclosed establishment of a sales return allowance as well as the Company's accounting treatment for leases. Due to the focused but time-consuming review being conducted by the Company and its independent professional advisors, the Company's financial statements and the associated audit by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, have not been able to be completed in order to permit the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004. Accordingly, results for the fiscal 2005 first quarter as well as the comparative results from prior periods that are provided herein are provided on a preliminary basis. Management does not believe that the ongoing review of its prior reported financial statements will identify any other material errors or adjustments than those the Company has already reported or result in any material change to the Company's financial information contained herein. The Company is working diligently to complete the review process and file its Annual Report on Form 10-K as quickly as possible.
Accounting Restatements
Big 5 also announced that its Board of Directors has voted to declare a cash dividend, at an annual rate of $0.28 per share of outstanding common stock. The next quarterly dividend, of $0.07 per share, will be paid on June 15, 2005, to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2005.
Declaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company ended the fiscal 2005 first quarter operating 309 stores, opening one new store during the quarter, which was a relocation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company opened one new store, in the Denver, Colorado market, and is currently operating 310 stores. The Company anticipates opening between 16 and 20 net new stores in fiscal 2005.
Store Openings
Big 5 expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range for the second fiscal quarter of 2005, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. It should be noted that the impact of the restatements on previously reported fiscal 2004 second quarter earnings is preliminarily estimated to be a reduction of $0.02 per diluted share, to $0.31 per diluted share, including a $0.02 debt redemption charge. For the 2005 fiscal year, the Company expects same store sales growth in the low single-digit range, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.70 to $1.80, excluding a charge of $0.09 per diluted share associated with anticipated expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. The Company expects 2005 fiscal year earnings per diluted share of $1.61 to $1.71, including expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. The second quarter and fiscal year guidance, both as adjusted and as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), also do not include charges that will be incurred after the first fiscal quarter for expenses relating to the restatements because the Company is unable to adequately estimate those expenses at this time.
EPS Guidance
Big 5 will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific) to discuss financial results for the quarter ended April 3, 2005. The webcast will be available at www.big5sportinggoods.com and archived for three months.

About Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation
Except for historical information contained herein, the statements in this release are forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Big 5's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the competitive environment in the sporting goods industry in general and in Big 5's specific market areas, inflation, product availability and growth opportunities, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, changes in costs of goods, changes in interest rates and economic conditions in general. Those and other risks are more fully described in Big 5's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed on October 25, 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 26, 2004. Big 5 disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
 
 
 
The Company's earnings per diluted share (EPS) guidance for fiscal 2005 excludes anticipated expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. The Company believes the use of adjusted EPS for guidance for fiscal 2005 will provide additional insight into the Company's operating results as compared to estimated earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2005 due to the expenses the Company expects to incur related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. The Company will also use this adjusted reporting internally to evaluate its operating performance on that same basis. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of guidance net income per diluted share (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to adjusted net income per diluted share excluding anticipated expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center after tax:
As described above, the Company's EPS guidance does not include charges that are incurred after the first fiscal quarter for expenses relating to the restatements, because the Company is unable to estimate those expenses at this time.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On May 25, 2005, the Company received a notice of a determination by Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that it fails to comply with Nasdaq listing standards set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) due to the delayed filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending April 3, 2005. The Staff informed the Company that such additional delinquency was considered at the May 19, 2005 oral hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). The Company had previously requested such hearing in connection with the receipt of a delisting notice with respect to the delayed filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005. The Company filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2005 to report that it was unable to file its fiscal 2005 first quarter Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by the May 13, 2005 deadline.
     As previously announced, the Company is working diligently to complete the review process in connection with its previously-announced restatements so that the Company's fiscal 2004 financial statements and the associated audit by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, may be completed in order to permit the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 as quickly as possible and the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal 2005 first quarter promptly thereafter. The Company announced preliminary results for the fiscal 2005 first quarter on May 4, 2005.
     As a result of the Company's noncompliance with these NASDAQ requirements for continued listing, the Company's common stock is subject to delisting from the NASDAQ National Market. On May 19, 2005, the Company participated in an oral hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting of its common stock. The Company requested that the Panel grant it an extension of time to finish such review and audit and to make the filings. There can be no assurance, however, that the Panel will grant the Company's request. The Company's common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the outcome of the appeal under the symbol BGFVE.
     The Company issued a press release on June 1, 2005 regarding these matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, reported today that it received a notice on May 25, 2005 of a determination by Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that it fails to comply with Nasdaq listing standards set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) due to the delayed filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and that this deficiency is an additional basis for delisting its securities from the Nasdaq National Market. The Company filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on May 16, 2005 to report that it was unable to file its fiscal 2005 first quarter Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by the May 13, 2005 deadline.
El Segundo, CA  June 1, 2005
The Company had previously reported that it received a notice of a determination by Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that it fails to comply with Nasdaq listing standards set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) due to the delayed filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 with the SEC and that its securities were therefore subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market. The Company appealed the determination to the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"), thus staying the delisting action pending the issuance of the Panel's decision. On May 19, 2005, the Company attended a hearing before the Panel at which both the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing delinquencies were considered.
As previously announced, the Company is working diligently to complete the review process in connection with its previously-announced restatements so that the Company's fiscal 2004 financial statements and the associated audit by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, may be completed in order to permit the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 as quickly as possible and the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal 2005 first quarter promptly thereafter.

There can be no assurance, however, that the Panel will grant the Company's request. The Company announced preliminary results for the fiscal 2005 first quarter on May 4, 2005.
 
The Company's common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the Panel's decision under the symbol BGFVE. In the event that the Panel determines not to grant the Company's request for continued listing, the Company may be delisted from the NASDAQ National Market.

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, announced today that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") has granted the Company an extension until August 12, 2005 to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 (the "Fiscal 2004 Form 10-K") and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2005 (the "first quarter Fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q") and to continue the listing of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ National Market pending such filings. As previously announced, the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ requirements for continued listing as a result of its failure to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and its first quarter Fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and its common stock is therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ National Market.
El Segundo, CA  June 2, 2005
In connection with granting the Company's request for an extension, the Panel is requiring that the Company provide prompt notification to the Panel regarding any significant events that occur prior to the August 12, 2005 filing deadline as well as certain information relating to the Company's review process, once completed, in connection with its previously-announced restatements. The Company must also comply with all other continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ National Market to maintain its listing.
The Company is working diligently to complete the review process in connection with its previously-announced restatements so that its fiscal 2004 financial statements and the associated audit by KPMG LLP may be completed in order to permit the filing of the Company's Fiscal 2004 Form 10-K as quickly as possible and the filing of its first quarter Fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q promptly thereafter. If the Company is unable to file those reports by the August 12, 2005 extension date, it will request a further extension, but such an extension may not be granted, in which case its common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ National Market.
The Company has also obtained from the lenders under its financing agreement an extension to July 1, 2005 to deliver its audited financial statements for fiscal 2004 as required by its financing agreement. If the Company is not able to deliver such statements by then, it
 
intends to seek another extension, although there is no assurance that one will be granted. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in its financing agreement.

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported that it achieved its 38th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales performance for the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2005. The Company expects to report, based upon preliminary sales results, a same store sales increase of approximately 2.7% for the second fiscal quarter versus the comparable 13-week period of 2004.
El Segundo, CA  July 29, 2005 
The Company also announced that it will delay reporting its preliminary results for the fiscal 2005 second quarter until it completes its financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 and its previously announced restatement of its financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, as well as its quarterly financial statements for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. The previously announced restatement adjustments relate to the correction of an error in an account within accounts payable, an adjustment to accounting for certain leases and the spreading over appropriate periods of the Company's prior implementation of a sales return reserve in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition, also as previously announced, the Company and its independent professional advisors have been conducting a review of the Company's prior financial statements on behalf and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. While the review is not yet complete, the Company currently expects that additional corrections to its prior financial statements will be required as part of the restatement. The Company believes that the cumulative, net impact on the Company's net income of the additional corrections that the Company is aware of at this time, as well as the adjustments relating to the previously announced lease accounting changes and sales return reserve, for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 will be less than 3% of aggregate net income as preliminarily reported on February 9,
 
2005 for such fiscal year periods, which reflected the preliminary adjustments to address the error in an account within accounts payable. These matters will also reduce net income for prior periods, which the Company anticipates will be reflected in an opening balance sheet adjustment for fiscal 2002.
Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "While I recognize that the restatement process has been frustrating for our shareholders, we are hopeful that this process is drawing to a close. Although significant time and attention has been devoted to the restatement process, we have remained focused on our business and are pleased to have maintained our consistent same store sales performance and to have achieved our 38th consecutive quarter of comp store sales increases. We are also pleased to report that the transition to our new distribution center in Riverside, California is proceeding smoothly in accordance with our plans."

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, today announced that it is enhancing its finance and accounting department in order to improve the Company's accounting and financial reporting, as well as the Company's internal controls. Under this initiative, the Company will recruit and hire a new Chief Financial Officer, with a strong background in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and SEC financial reporting, to be the Company's principal financial and accounting officer. The new CFO will report directly to the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Company is undertaking these actions in light of the previously announced restatement of the Company's prior financial statements and the ongoing review of those financial statements, as well as the demands of the current regulatory environment.
El Segundo, CA  August 5, 2005 
As part of the Company's effort to strengthen its finance and accounting department, the Company and Charles P. Kirk have mutually agreed that he will resign his positions as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective today. Mr. Kirk will remain a Senior Vice President and a member of the Company's senior management team. The Company believes that Mr. Kirk will continue to add significant value to the Company.
The Company has retained a search firm and is actively engaged in the process of identifying and assessing appropriate candidates for the CFO position. The Company is committed to filling the CFO position expeditiously. Until a new CFO is hired, Elizabeth F. Chambers, the Company's Acting Controller, and Thomas L. Robershaw, the Company's Assistant Treasurer, jointly will fulfill the functions of the Company's principal financial and accounting officer. Ms. Chambers previously served as the Company's Assistant Controller since 1993. Mr. Robershaw joined the Company in 2002 as Assistant Treasurer.
Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "We want to thank Chuck Kirk for his many years of dedicated service as our CFO. We look forward to continuing to work with Chuck and believe that our Company will continue to benefit from his considerable retail expertise and experience. At the same time, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that we engage a new CFO who is a certified public accountant and who possesses more financial accounting and public reporting expertise. We continue to work diligently to complete the restatement process as quickly as possible."
The Company does not expect that the change in Mr. Kirk's role will cause any additional delay in the completion of its previously announced restatement or the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005. Additionally, as the Company announced on July 29, 2005, additional corrections to its prior financial statements will be required as part of the restatement. The expected cumulative net impact on the Company's net income of all additional corrections that the Company is aware of at this time, as well as the adjustments relating to the previously announced lease accounting changes and sales return reserve, for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 remains less than 3% of aggregate net income as preliminarily reported on February 9, 2005 for such fiscal year periods, which reflected the preliminary adjustments to address the previously announced error in an account within accounts payable. As also stated in the July 29, 2005 announcement, these matters will reduce net income for prior periods, which the Company anticipates will be reflected in a balance sheet adjustment for fiscal 2002.
The Company is continuing to work diligently to complete the review process in connection with the restatement so that its fiscal 2004 financial statements and the associated audit by KPMG LLP may be completed in order to permit the filing of the Company's Annual Report for fiscal 2004 and Quarterly Reports for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. If the Company is unable to file the Annual Report for fiscal 2004 and the Quarterly Report for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 by the August 12, 2005 extension date given it by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, it will request a further extension, but such an extension may not be granted, in which case its common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ National Market.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On August 12, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") notified Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that the Company fails to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) for continued listing due to the delayed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2005 (the "second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q"). As previously reported, the Company previously received notices of determination by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff that the Company fails to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) for continued listing due to the delayed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 (the "fiscal 2004 Form 10-K") and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2005 (the "first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q") and that its securities are therefore subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market.
     On June 1, 2005, the Company received an extension from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") until August 12, 2005 to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and to continue the listing of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ National Market pending such filings. However, the Company was not able to file such reports by the extension deadline and has so notified the Panel and requested a further extension. The Company has also requested an extension of time to file its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q. The Company will announce the Panel's decision promptly after a decision is received. There can be no assurance that an extension will be granted. If an extension is not granted, the Company's common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ National Market. In such event, the Company expects that its shares would trade in the over-the-counter market and the Company would apply for relisting of its shares on the NASDAQ National Market as soon as its SEC filings were current.
     Work on the review and associated audit of the Company's fiscal 2004 Form 10-K has been substantially completed. The Company expects that the review and audit will be completed and the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K will be filed shortly. The Company also expects that the review of the first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q will be completed and that it will be able to file the first quarter fiscal 2005 shortly after the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K is filed. The Company will file its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q as soon as practicable following the filing of the first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q.
Form 10-Q
Item 8.01. Other Matters.
     The Company issued a press release on August 15, 2005 regarding the matters described in Item 3.01, receipt of an extension of time to deliver its audited financial statements to the lenders under its financing agreement and the declaration of the Company's quarterly dividend. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, today announced that it has submitted a request to the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel for an additional extension of the deadline for the Company to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The Panel had previously agreed to continue the listing of the Company's securities on the NASDAQ National Market provided that the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 on or before August 12, 2005. The Company notified the Panel that it would be unable to meet the August 12 deadline and requested a further extension. There can be no assurance that an extension will be granted. If an extension is not granted, the Company's common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ National Market. In such event, the Company expects that its shares would trade in the over-the-counter market and the Company would apply for relisting of its shares on the NASDAQ National Market as soon as its SEC filings were current.
El Segundo, CA  August 15, 2005 
Work on the review and associated audit of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 has been substantially completed. The Company expects that the review and audit will be completed and the Form 10-K will be filed shortly. The Company also expects that the review of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 will be completed and that it will be able to file that Form 10-Q shortly after the Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed. The Company also was unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 by the August 12, 2005 deadline and will file a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report this. The completion and review of this Quarterly Report has been delayed pending the completion and filing of the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company will file the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as soon as practicable following the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The late filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 constitutes an additional basis for the delisting of the Company's common stock from the NASDAQ National Market and the Company has notified Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff of the late filing. The Company has also requested an extension of time to file this Form 10-Q.
 
Big 5 Sporting Goods 2-2-2
As the Company announced on July 29, 2005, additional corrections to its prior financial statements will be required as part of the previously announced restatement of such financial statements. The expected cumulative net impact on the Company's net income of all additional corrections that the Company is aware of at this time, as well as the adjustments relating to the previously announced lease accounting changes and sales return reserve, for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 remains less than 3% of aggregate net income as preliminarily reported on February 9, 2005 for such fiscal year periods, which reflected the preliminary adjustments to address the previously announced error in an account within accounts payable. As also stated in the July 29, 2005 announcement, these matters will reduce net income for prior periods, which the Company anticipates will be reflected in a balance sheet adjustment for fiscal 2002.
Financing Agreement
The Company also has obtained from the lenders under its financing agreement an extension to August 31, 2005 to deliver its audited financial statements for fiscal 2004 as required by its financing agreement. While the Company expects to be able to deliver such audited financial statements by then, if the Company is not able to do so, it intends to seek another extension, although there is no assurance that one will be granted. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in its financing agreement.
Declaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has voted to declare a cash dividend, at an annual rate of $0.28 per share of outstanding common stock. The next quarterly dividend, of $0.07 per share, will be paid on September 15, 2005, to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2005.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On August 25, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") received notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") that the Panel had granted the Company's request to extend the deadline for the Company to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 (the "fiscal 2004 Form 10-K") and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 3, 2005 (the "first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q") and July 3, 2005 (the "second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q") and to continue the listing of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market pending those filings. The Panel granted the Company an extension until August 31, 2005 to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and an extension until September 30, 2005 to file its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q. These dates are an additional extension from the August 12, 2005 extension date previously granted by the Panel for the Company to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q. As previously announced, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq requirements for continued listing as a result of its failure to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K, its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q.
     In granting this additional extension, the Panel advised the Company that in the event that the Company is unable to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K by August 31, 2005, no further requests for extension to file such Form 10-K would be considered.
     The Company also received a notice on August 25, 2005 of a determination by Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that it fails to comply with Nasdaq listing standards set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) due to the delayed filing of its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q with the SEC and that this deficiency is an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities from the Nasdaq National Market. The Company filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on August 15, 2005 to report that it was unable to file its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q by the August 12, 2005 deadline. The Company previously announced that it had notified Nasdaq of its inability to timely file the second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and had requested an extension of time to file such Form 10-Q. As described above, the Panel considered this request and granted the Company an extension to September 30, 2005 to file its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q.
     In the event that the Company is unable to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K by August 31, 2005, or its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q by September 30, 2005, the Company's common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.
     The Company issued a press release on August 26, 2005 regarding these matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On August 31, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") notified Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Staff that KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, had informed the Company that KPMG had not yet completed its final review and audit of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 (the "fiscal 2004 Form 10-K") and that, as a result, the Company was not able to file the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the August 31, 2005 extended deadline provided by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). KPMG is completing its final review and audit of the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K. Based on discussions with KPMG, the Company had expected that this review and audit would be completed in order to permit the filing of such Form 10-K by August 31, 2005. The Company has now been advised by KPMG that it still needs an additional few days for all work associated with the audit to be completed.
     The Company previously announced that the Panel had granted the Company an additional extension to August 31, 2005 to file the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and that, as part of its decision, the Panel advised the Company that no further requests for an extension to file the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K would be considered. On August 31, 2005, the Company and KPMG advised the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Hearings Department of the status of the Company's fiscal 2004 Form 10-K and the Company requested that the Panel grant an additional brief extension of time to allow KPMG to conclude its work and to enable the Company to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K. The Company has not received any decision from the Panel in response to its request, and there can be no assurance that the Company's request will be granted. In the event that the request is not granted, the Company's shares may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. In such event, the Company expects that its shares would trade in the over-the-counter market and the Company would apply for relisting of its shares on the Nasdaq National Market as soon as its SEC filings were current.
Item 8.01. Other Matters.
     The Company issued a press release on August 31, 2005 regarding the matters described in Item 3.01 and receipt of an extension of time to deliver its audited financial statements to the lenders under its financing agreement. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to liability under that Section, except as specifically incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
     On September 8, 2005, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release in which it reported its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and full year net income, the impact of the restatement of its prior period financial statements on net income for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 as preliminarily reported and the matters described in Item 3.01. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
     On September 8, 2005, the Company received a determination from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") to continue the listing of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market following the Company's filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 (the "fiscal 2004 Form 10-K") with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Panel had previously granted the Company an extension to August 31, 2005 to file the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K. The Company subsequently requested that the Panel grant an additional extension of time to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K, and before receiving any determination from the Panel, filed the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K on September 6, 2005. In its decision, the Panel denied the Company's request for a further extension, but determined to continue the listing of the Company's shares because the Company had filed its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K before adverse action by the Panel. In order to continue to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market, the Company must file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 3, 2005 and July 3, 2005 (the "first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q" and the "second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q", respectively) by the September 30, 2005 extended deadline previously set by the Panel. The determination received from the Panel stated that if the Company is unable to file its first quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q and its second quarter fiscal 2005 Form 10-Q by the September 30, 2005 deadline, no further extension requests will be considered and the Company's common stock will be immediately delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to file these Quarterly Reports by the September 30, 2005 deadline.

The Company subsequently requested that the Panel grant an additional extension of time to file its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K, and before receiving any determination from the Panel, the Company filed the fiscal 2004 Form 10-K on September 6, 2005. In the decision received today, the Panel denied the Company's request for a further extension, but determined to continue the listing of the Company's shares because the Company had filed its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K before adverse action by the Panel.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.,  September 8, 2005
The fiscal 2004 Form 10-K includes the previously announced restatement of the Company's prior reported financial statements for fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, as well as the quarterly periods of fiscal 2003 and the first three quarterly periods of fiscal 2004.
The Company restated its prior period financial statements to correct a previously-announced error in an account within accounts payable that the Company discovered during its normal year-end account closing process for fiscal 2004. In addition, the Company also made changes to its accounting treatment for certain leases following the February 7, 2005 letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chief Accountant clarifying the Commission staff's interpretation of certain lease accounting issues and spread over appropriate quarterly periods a previously implemented sales return reserve. The Company and its independent professional advisors also conducted a review of the Company's prior financial statements on behalf and under the supervision of the Audit Committee, and this review identified additional items for correction in the restatement. Details regarding the restatement are included in the Company's fiscal 2004 Form 10-K.
The impact on previously reported net income of the adjustments necessary to correct the error in an account within accounts payable was $(1.8) million and $(1.4) million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, respectively, and there was no change to net income for fiscal 2004 as preliminarily reported on February 9, 2005. The cumulative, net impact on previously reported net income of all other
 
restatement items, including the lease accounting changes and reallocation of the sales return reserve implemented by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, was $0.02 million, $(1.4) million and $(0.7) million in fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 as preliminarily reported, respectively. The cumulative, net impact of these additional restatement items represented less than 3% of aggregate net income for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004 as restated to reflect the correction of the error in an account within accounts payable. The restatement also reduced net income for prior periods, which was reflected in an opening balance sheet adjustment of $(3.2) million for fiscal 2002.
Net income for the 2004 fourth quarter, after giving effect to all restatement adjustments, was $9.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, versus preliminarily reported net income of $11.6 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Net income for the 2004 fiscal year, after all restatement adjustments, was $33.5 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, versus preliminarily reported net income of $34.3 million, or $1.50 per diluted share.
The Company is working to file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005 as soon as possible. In order to continue to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market, the Company must file these Quarterly Reports by the September 30, 2005 extended deadline previously set by the Panel. The determination received from the Panel today stated that if the Company is unable to file these Quarterly Reports by the September 30, 2005 deadline, no further extension requests will be considered and the Company's common stock will be immediately delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to file these Quarterly Reports by the September 30, 2005 deadline.

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFVE), a leading sporting goods retailer, announced today that it has filed its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company previously announced that it had received an extension from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel until September 30, 2005 to file these Quarterly Reports. Having become current with its SEC filings, the Company expects that the fifth character "E" will soon be removed from its trading symbol on the Nasdaq Stock Market and its trading symbol will be restored to BGFV.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.,  September 30, 2005
The Forms 10-Q filed by the Company include financial results for the fiscal 2005 first and second quarters and the twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2005.
For the fiscal 2005 first quarter, net sales increased 4.5% to $190.1 million from net sales, as previously restated, of $181.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Same store sales for the period increased 1.8% versus the same 13-week period last year, representing the Company's 37th consecutive quarter of same store sales growth over comparable prior periods. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 decreased to $6.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to previously restated net income of $7.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Prior to completing the restatement of prior period financial statements, the Company had announced preliminary net income of $7.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2005 first quarter.
First Quarter Results
First quarter fiscal 2005 results included charges totaling $0.8 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with legal and audit fees related to the Company's restatement and a flood loss at one of the Company's store locations. These charges were not reflected in the preliminary net income previously announced by the Company.
Additionally, first quarter fiscal 2005 results were impacted by the establishment of new allowances relating to inventory as part of the Company's restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company previously recognized losses associated with returned products after these products were
 
processed through the returned goods department at its distribution center. As part of the restatement, the Company changed its methodology for accounting for returned products and has established valuation allowances for all products in its inventory. The Company applied these new inventory allowance methodologies to the fiscal 2004 quarterly periods as part of the restatement. The application of these new allowances and the volume of returned goods inventories and the resulting estimated realizability of the value of these returned goods negatively impacted fiscal 2005 first quarter results by $0.6 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, and positively impacted fiscal 2004 first quarter results by $0.9 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share.
Net income comparisons for the first quarter also were impacted by the application of revised inventory cost capitalization methodologies adopted as part of the restatement. This added $0.4 million (pretax), or $0.01 per diluted share, to fiscal 2005 first quarter results, and added $0.8 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, to fiscal 2004 first quarter results.
For the fiscal 2005 second quarter, net sales increased 7.3% to $198.1 million from net sales, as restated, of $184.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Same store sales for the period increased 2.6% versus the same 13-week period last year, representing the Company's 38th consecutive quarter of same store sales growth over comparable prior periods. Net income decreased to $6.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2005 second quarter, compared to restated net income of $7.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income for the fiscal 2004 second quarter includes a charge of $0.8 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $15.0 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes.
Second Quarter Results
Second quarter fiscal 2005 results included charges of $1.9 million (pretax), or $0.05 per diluted share, associated with legal and audit fees relating to the restatement and other matters, and an additional $0.7 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, relating to the recognition of rent and other costs associated with starting the transition of operations to the Company's new distribution center. The Company had previously believed that it would not be required to recognize rent for the new distribution center until the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Second quarter net income also was reduced by accrual adjustments relating to workers' compensation costs and employee bonuses, the effects of which were partially offset by the positive effects of the application of the revised inventory cost capitalization methodologies and a partial recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the fiscal 2005 first quarter flood loss.
For the twenty-six week period ended July 3, 2005, net sales increased 5.9% to $388.2 million from restated net sales of $366.6 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 2.2% versus the same twenty-six week period in fiscal 2004. Net income decreased to $12.6 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005, compared to restated net income of $15.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
"We are very pleased to have now become current on our SEC filings," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This has been a very long and challenging process for us and we look forward to returning our full attention to our business operations. Earnings results through the second quarter have been significantly impacted by unusual items, including the costs of the restatement and the transition to our new distribution center, as well
 
as the revision and refinement of our accounting methodologies. However, our fundamental business remains strong. We have enjoyed solid and improving sales trends throughout the year and, with the completion of the third quarter, we will have achieved our 39 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales."
th
The Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company expects that changes in the application of accounting methodologies as part of the restatement, including those discussed above, may continue to have an impact on previously issued earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2005. For that reason, previously issued full-year guidance should not be relied upon. The Company intends to provide revised full-year guidance after its accounting personnel, including its new Chief Financial Officer, have had sufficient opportunity to analyze the anticipated impact of these accounting changes on future earnings.
Third Quarter Same Store Sales Guidance; Full-Year Earnings Guidance
The Company opened one new store, which was a relocation, during the fiscal 2005 first quarter. The Company opened 3 new stores, one of which was a relocation, during the fiscal 2005 second quarter. During the third quarter to date, the Company has opened 4 new stores and closed one store, bringing its current total store count to 314. The Company expects to open a total of between 15 and 17 net new stores during fiscal 2005.
Store Openings
Construction has been substantially completed on the Company's new distribution center located in Riverside, California, and the Company's transition to this facility has been proceeding positively. The Company has been receiving product at its new distribution center for several weeks. Starting in the first week of October 2005, the Company will begin shipping product from the new distribution center, as well as begin moving product from its existing distribution center to its new facility. The Company expects to complete the transition to its new distribution center during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2005 third quarter ended October 2, 2005.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.  November 10, 2005
For the fiscal 2005 third quarter, net sales increased by $8.8 million, or 4.5%, to $206.8 million from net sales, as previously restated, of $198.0 million in the third quarter of 2004. Same store sales increased 3.8% during the third fiscal quarter versus the same 13-week calendar period last year, representing the Company's 39 consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales over comparable prior periods. On a fiscal quarter basis, same store sales increased 1.2% during the third quarter versus the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The difference in same store sales comparisons was due to fiscal 2005 being a 52-week year and fiscal 2004 being a 53-week year and the resulting calendar shift of pre-Fourth of July holiday business out of the fiscal 2005 third quarter. Net income for the fiscal 2005 third quarter was $7.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with previously restated net income of $8.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2004 third quarter.
th
Third quarter fiscal 2005 results included charges totaling approximately $1.9 million (pretax), or $0.05 per diluted share, associated with legal, audit and other fees related to the Company's restatement of prior reported financial statements. Third quarter expenses also reflected an increase of approximately $2.3 million in distribution center expenses, of which approximately $1.5 million (pretax), or $0.04 per diluted share, was directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. The increase related to the transition to the new distribution center was generally in line with the Company's expectations for the third quarter.
Net income comparisons for the third quarter were affected by the application of revised inventory cost capitalization methodologies adopted as part of the prior restatement. This increased fiscal 2005 third quarter pretax profit by $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, third quarter results benefited from the Company's recording of $1.8 million
 
Big 5 Sporting Goods 2-2-2
in proceeds from the settlement of a claim related to the required relocation of one of the Company's stores following an eminent domain action by a city redevelopment agency, which increased the Company's net income by $0.05 per diluted share.
For the thirty-nine week period ended October 2, 2005, net sales increased by $30.5 million, or 5.4%, to $595.1 million from restated net sales of $564.6 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 2.8% versus the same thirty-nine week calendar period in fiscal 2004. On a fiscal quarter basis, same store sales increased 2.2% during the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 versus the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. Net income was $19.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2005, compared to restated net income of $24.1 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 include an increase of approximately $4.3 million in distribution center expenses, of which approximately $2.2 million (pretax), or $0.06 per diluted share, was directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center, and costs of approximately $3.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, associated with legal, audit and other expenses for the Company's restatement. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 include a second quarter pretax charge of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $15.0 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes.
"We are pleased with our sales performance during the third quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The shift of our pre-Fourth of July holiday business out of our third fiscal quarter this year, when it had been in the third quarter last year, significantly affected comparability between our fiscal periods. Earnings results also continued to be impacted by unusual items, including the costs of the restatement and the transition to our new distribution center, as well as the revision and refinement of our accounting methodologies. We are very encouraged that sales trends for the year have improved over each quarter and this momentum has continued into the fourth quarter. Our October period comp store sales performance was our strongest monthly comparison of 2005, measured on a calendar-day to calendar-day basis. We believe that we are well positioned for the holiday season."
EPS Guidance
Fiscal 2004 was a 53-week year, with the fourth quarter having fourteen weeks, while fiscal 2005 is a 52-week year, with the fourth quarter having thirteen weeks. The fourth quarter sales guidance discussed below is provided on a thirteen-week calendar-day to calendar-day basis, and the full-year sales guidance discussed below is provided on a 52-week calendar-day to calendar-day basis. The Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.40 to $0.44. This includes anticipated charges of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share for expenses directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. For the 2005 fiscal year, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single digit range, resulting in earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.27 to $1.31, including charges of approximately $0.12 to $0.13 per diluted share for expenses directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center and approximately $0.10 per diluted share associated with legal, audit and other expenses related to the restatement. The Company expects 2005 fiscal year earnings per diluted share of $1.49 to $1.54, excluding expenses directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center and expenses related to the restatement.

The Company's earnings per diluted share (EPS) guidance for fiscal 2005 excludes expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center and legal, audit and other expenses related to the Company's restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company believes the use of adjusted EPS for guidance for fiscal 2005 will provide additional insight into the Company's operating results as compared to estimated earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2005 due to the expenses the Company expects to incur related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center and legal, audit and other expenses related to the Company's restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company will also use this adjusted reporting internally to evaluate its operating performance on that same basis. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of guidance net income per diluted share (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to adjusted net income per diluted share excluding expenses related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center and legal, audit and other expenses related to the Company's restatement of prior period financial statements:

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported net sales for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended January 1, 2006.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.,  January 9, 2006
For the 13-week fiscal 2005 fourth quarter, net sales were $217.1 million, versus net sales of $217.6 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the Company's fourth quarter. On a comparable 13-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, net sales increased 5.1% and same store sales increased 1.5%. This same store sales increase represented the Company's 40 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons. The Company's results were impacted by unfavorable winter weather comparisons in California and the southwest, which were partially offset by favorable winter weather comparisons in the northwest. Sales of non-winter-related products were generally in line with the Company's expectations for the quarter.
th
For the 52 weeks ended January 1, 2006, net sales increased 3.8% to $812.1 million from $782.2 million for the corresponding 53-week fiscal year in 2004. On a comparable 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004, net sales increased 5.7% and same store sales increased 2.4%.
During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced higher costs than anticipated related to the ongoing transition to the Company's new distribution center in Riverside, California.
 
These incremental costs resulted primarily from the need to devote additional labor resources to address the complexities of operating two distribution center facilities simultaneously during the transition while minimizing disruption of product flow to the Company's stores over the holiday period. The Company expects the impact of these higher costs will reduce earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter by approximately $0.06 from the Company's original fourth quarter guidance. The Company continues to expect to be fully operational at the new distribution center facility by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006. However, the Company expects to continue to devote more labor resources to the transition than previously anticipated during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in order to facilitate smooth product flow between the Company's distribution facilities and its stores.
The Company now expects earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 versus previous guidance of $0.40 to $0.44 per diluted share.
"Although we are pleased to have achieved our 40 consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales, we are disappointed that our sales performance fell somewhat short of our plan, with particular softness in winter-related categories," said Steven G. Miller, Big 5's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our move to the new distribution center has been an enormous task and we are pleased that we remain on schedule to complete the transition during the first quarter of 2006. We very much look forward to running all distribution operations out of our new facility in the near future."

 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full year that ended on January 1, 2006.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.,  March 9, 2006
For the 13-week fiscal 2005 fourth quarter, net sales were $218.9 million versus net sales of $217.6 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the Company's fourth quarter. On a comparable 13-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, net sales for the quarter increased by $12.4 million, or 6.0%, and same store sales increased 1.5%. This same store sales increase represented the Company's 40 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $7.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared with net income of $9.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter.
th
Fourth quarter sales were negatively affected by unfavorable winter weather comparisons in California and the southwest, which were partially offset by favorable winter weather comparisons in the northwest. Sales of non-winter-related products were generally in line with the Company's expectations for the quarter.
 
Fourth quarter fiscal 2005 results include the impact of approximately $4.5 million (pretax), or $0.12 per diluted share, of expenses directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. These increased expenses resulted from the need to devote additional labor to minimize disruption of product flow to the Company's stores during the holiday period, duplicate facility costs from simultaneously operating two distribution center facilities, transition-related trucking and incremental depreciation charges. Costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work for 2005 also were concentrated into the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 first quarter.
Income comparisons for the fourth quarter also were affected by the amount of inventory cost capitalization of warehouse expenses, primarily due to higher costs related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. This increased fiscal 2005 fourth quarter pretax profit by $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to the same period of the prior year. Income for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter includes a charge of $1.3 million (pretax), or $0.03 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $33.1 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes.
For the 52 weeks ended January 1, 2006, net sales increased by $31.8 million, or 4.1%, to $814.0 million from $782.2 million for the corresponding 53-week 2004 fiscal year. On a comparable 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, net sales for the year increased by $45.9 million, or 6.0%, and same store sales increased 2.4%. Net income for fiscal 2005 was $27.5 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, versus net income for fiscal 2004 of $33.5 million, or $1.47 per diluted share.
Results for fiscal 2005 include the impact of approximately $6.7 million (pretax), or $0.18 per diluted share, of expenses directly attributable to the Company's transition to its new distribution center, and costs of approximately $3.9 million (pretax), or $0.10 per diluted share, for legal, audit and other expenses relating to the Company's restatement.
Income comparisons for fiscal 2005 also were affected by the amount of inventory cost capitalization of warehouse expenses, primarily due to higher costs related to the Company's transition to its new distribution center. This increased fiscal 2005 pretax profit by $2.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to the prior year. Additionally, results for fiscal 2005 benefited from the Company's recording in the third quarter of $1.8 million (pretax) in proceeds from the settlement of a claim related to the required relocation of one of the Company's stores following an eminent domain action by a city redevelopment agency, which increased the Company's income by $0.05 per diluted share. Income for fiscal 2004 includes charges totaling $2.1 million (pretax), or $0.06 per diluted share, associated with the redemption of $48.1 million principal amount of the Company's 10.875% senior notes.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, construction was completed on the Company's new distribution center located in Riverside, California. During the first quarter of 2006, the Company completed its transition to the new distribution center, and the Company is now running all distribution operations out of the new facility. All product is being received into and shipped out of the new facility, all existing distribution center product has been moved into the new facility and the old facility has been closed.
New Distribution Center
"While our results reflect the significant challenges we faced during 2005, we are confident in our overall business model and believe that our investments have placed us in a strong position to grow our business," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our team worked extremely hard to complete the enormous transition to our new distribution center on schedule with as little disruption of product flow to our stores as possible during the busy holiday season and into the first quarter. This effort proved more costly than we had previously anticipated, but we are pleased to have achieved solid sales growth through the transition. We are now making refinements to improve productivity and efficiency at the new distribution center, and we look forward to servicing our growing store base with this facility for years to come. Although we expect our bottom line for 2006 to be impacted by continued expense pressures, we are very pleased that our sales for the first quarter are off to a strong start, and we feel well positioned to carry this sales momentum into the second quarter."
The Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2006, and earnings per diluted share of $1.23 to $1.33 for the full year. This full-year earnings guidance reflects the costs associated with the Company's transition to its new distribution center and with the commencement of operations at a substantially larger distribution facility, higher than expected audit-related expenses following the Company's previously completed restatement of prior period financials and higher interest costs resulting from rising interest rates. Full-year earnings guidance also reflects the expected impact of the implementation of new accounting rules requiring the expensing of stock options and the expected impact of a substantially lower benefit from inventory cost capitalization than the Company experienced in fiscal 2005.
Guidance
The Company opened ten new stores during the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter, bringing its year-end store count to 324 stores. The Company anticipates opening two new stores during the first quarter of 2006, and opening a total of approximately 20 new stores during fiscal 2006.
Store Openings
 
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full year. The webcast will be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

Integrated Corporate Relations, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 395-2215
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 11, 2006  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 first quarter that ended on April 2, 2006.
For the fiscal 2006 first quarter, net sales increased $17.1 million, or 9.0%, to $207.2 million from net sales of $190.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Same store sales increased 5.3% for the first quarter, representing the Company's 41 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons.
st
Gross profit increased 8.3% to $73.4 million from $67.8 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 35.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 versus 35.7% in the first quarter of the prior year. Margin comparisons were affected by higher distribution center costs over the prior year of $4.6 million, which were primarily driven by the completion of the Company's transition to, and the commencement of full-scale operations at, a new distribution center and increased trucking expenses reflecting higher gasoline prices. Gross profit comparisons for the first quarter also were affected by a
 
$1.7 million increase in the current year of distribution center costs capitalized into inventory.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were unchanged from the prior year at 27.7% in the first quarter. Selling and administrative expenses this year were affected by a $1.6 million increase in legal and audit fees during the first quarter, resulting primarily from higher audit costs and higher accounting consultant costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work, and by a provision of $0.4 million (pre-tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options. For the first quarter, the Company was able to leverage store-related expenses and advertising expenses, which declined 50 basis points and 30 basis points as a percentage of sales, respectively, versus the first quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.0 million, or 27.6%, to $4.4 million for the first quarter, from $3.4 million for the same period last year. This higher expense was primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Company's new distribution center, and also reflected an increase in store count to 326 stores at the end of the first quarter of this year from 309 stores at the end of the first quarter last year. Interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $0.7 million over the prior year, reflecting rising interest rates.
Net income for the first quarter was $5.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, including a charge of $0.01 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options, compared with net income of $6.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
First quarter fiscal 2006 pre-tax income includes approximately $1.8 million in distribution center transition costs that the Company anticipates will be non-recurring. Additionally, current year earnings reflect charges of approximately $0.7 million in audit and accounting consultant costs for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work relating to fiscal 2005 that was performed during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. First quarter comparisons also were affected by the aforementioned $1.7 million increase in 2006 of distribution center costs capitalized into inventory. First quarter fiscal 2005 results included a charge of $0.5 million related to a flood loss at one of the Company's stores.
"We are pleased to report our strongest comp store sales performance over the last sixteen quarters," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Each of our major merchandise categories of footwear, hard goods and apparel posted gains, with exceptional strength in winter products driven by favorable winter weather comparisons, particularly over the last several weeks of the quarter. We are also pleased to now be fully operational in our new distribution center and we continue to realize increasing efficiencies as we gain experience in this substantially larger facility."
 
Dividend Increase and Share Repurchase Program
The Company's Board of Directors has authorized an increase of the Company's cash dividend from an annual rate of $0.28 per share to an annual rate of $0.36 per share. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2006 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2006.
The Company's Board of Directors also has authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $15.0 million of the Company's common stock. Under the authorization, the Company may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the timing and amount of such purchases, if any, would be at the discretion of management, and would depend on market conditions and other considerations.
"We feel very confident about our business and because of the improving cash flow in our operations, we are pleased to be able to deliver value to our stockholders through this dividend increase," said Steven G. Miller. "We also believe that our share repurchase program provides us an additional means to enhance stockholder value over the long term."
Guidance
The Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and earnings per diluted share for the second quarter in the range of $0.23 to $0.27. Second quarter earnings guidance includes a charge of approximately $0.02 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. The Company continues to expect full-year same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range and full-year earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.23 to $1.33. Full-year earnings guidance includes a charge of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. Second quarter and full-year earnings guidance reflects significantly higher trucking expense resulting largely from higher gasoline prices, as well as higher distribution center expenses in connection with the operation of a substantially larger facility. As previously announced, earnings guidance also reflects higher than normal audit-related expenses following the Company's previously completed restatement of prior period financials, higher interest costs resulting from rising interest rates and the expected impact of a significantly lower benefit from inventory cost capitalization than the Company experienced in fiscal 2005.
Store Openings
The Company opened two new stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, bringing its store count at the end of the first quarter to 326 stores. The Company has opened one new store in the second quarter to date. The Company anticipates opening a total of three new stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and opening a total of approximately 20 new stores during fiscal 2006.
 
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EDT) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2006 first quarter. The webcast will be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

2) increase to $15,000,000 per fiscal year and $5,000,000 per fiscal quarter the amount of dividends (in addition to dividends of amounts necessary to pay income and franchise taxes and to reimburse the Company for out-of-pocket expenses incurred for the joint benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries) that Big 5 Corp. may make to the Company without reference to the use the Company makes of such dividends or to the liquidity of the Borrowers (assuming the absence of any defaults and pro forma compliance with financial covenants);
3) reduce to $30,000,000 the amount of post dividend liquidity (amounts available for drawing under the revolving line of credit plus unrestricted cash) necessary to make additional dividends to the Company from Big 5. Corp. for the purpose of making dividends on or repurchasing the Company's outstanding shares (assuming the absence of any defaults and pro forma compliance with financial covenants);
4) reduce the interest rates on the revolving credit facility such that it bears interest at various rates based on the Borrowers' performance and the average balance of revolving loans and undrawn letters of credit, with a floor of LIBOR plus 1.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of LIBOR plus 1.75% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 0.25%;
5) reduce the interest rate on the term loan facility to LIBOR plus 3.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 1.00%, regardless of the balance of the term loan facility;
6) postpone certain scheduled payment dates under the term loan facility; and
(7) extend the initial termination date for the revolving credit facility to March 20, 2011 (subject to annual extensions thereafter unless either the lenders or the Company's subsidiaries give notice of termination).
     The above description of the Amendment does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Amendment and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., August 10, 2006  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 second quarter that ended on July 2, 2006.
For the fiscal 2006 second quarter, net sales increased $13.7 million, or 6.9%, to $211.8 million from net sales of $198.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Same store sales increased 2.9% for the second quarter, representing the Company's 42 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons.
nd
Gross profit increased 5.9% to $76.7 million from $72.4 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 36.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 versus 36.6% in the second quarter of the prior year. Product selling margins, excluding buying, occupancy and distribution, increased 20 basis points versus the same period last year. Gross margin comparisons were affected by higher distribution center costs over the prior year of $2.2 million, which were primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Company's new distribution center and increased trucking expenses driven partly by higher gasoline prices. Gross profit for the second quarter of this year included a $0.4 million increase of distribution center costs capitalized into inventory, and gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 included an insurance reimbursement of $0.4 million related to flood damage to one of the Company's stores.
 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 27.7% in the second quarter of this year from 29.0% in the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to a $1.4 million reduction in legal and audit fees resulting from additional expense in the second quarter of last year related to the Company's restatement of prior period financial statements, the recording of co-op advertising cost reimbursements from vendors for fiscal 2006 earlier in the year, a reduction in workers' compensation reserves and the Company's receipt of proceeds as a participant in a class action settlement relating to credit card fees, which were partially offset by an increase in the Company's provision for public liability claims. Additionally, the Company's distribution center operations at its new facility created improved efficiencies for the Company's stores in product pricing and check-in, which allowed the Company to realize labor cost savings at the store level. Together with the Company's positive sales results, these factors contributed to the Company's leveraging of store-related expenses and advertising expenses for the second quarter, which declined 40 basis points and 50 basis points as a percentage of sales, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.5 million, or 14.9%, to $4.0 million for the second quarter, from $3.5 million for the same period last year. The higher expense was primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Company's new distribution center, and also reflected an increase in store count to 329 stores at the end of the second quarter of this year from 311 stores at the end of the second quarter last year. Interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $0.6 million over the prior year, primarily reflecting rising interest rates.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, from net income of $6.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 include a pre-tax charge of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options.
During the second quarter, the Company used borrowings under its revolving line of credit to prepay $5.0 million of higher interest term loan debt. During the quarter, the Company also amended its existing financing agreement to, among other things, increase its line of credit to $175.0 million and extend the initial termination date to March 20, 2011.
For the twenty-six week period ended July 2, 2006, net sales increased by $30.8 million, or 7.9%, to $419.0 million from net sales of $388.2 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 4.1% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006 versus the same period last year. Net income was $13.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006, compared to net income of $12.6 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Results for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006 include pre-tax charges totaling $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options.
 
"We are pleased to report a strong performance for our second quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We posted both sales and margin gains in each of our major merchandise categories of footwear, hard goods and apparel. We enjoyed an early and favorable start to the summer selling season driven by warm weather conditions in many of our markets. While we experienced higher distribution center expenses as a result of the commencement of operations at our new and substantially larger facility, we benefited from improved efficiencies at the store level. We are gaining valuable experience in operating our new facility and we are confident that we will realize greater efficiencies in our distribution center operations as we move forward."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 15, 2006 to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2006. As previously announced, during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the increase of the cash dividend from an annual rate of $0.28 per share to an annual rate of $0.36 per share.
Guidance
For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.32 to $0.36. This includes a charge of approximately $0.02 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. The Company expects full-year same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range and full-year earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.26 to $1.33. Full-year earnings guidance includes a charge of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. Third quarter and full-year earnings guidance reflects significantly higher trucking expense resulting in part from higher gasoline prices, higher distribution center expenses in connection with the operation of a substantially larger facility and higher interest costs resulting primarily from rising interest rates. Additionally, third quarter earnings guidance reflects the favorable impact of the recording of co-op advertising cost reimbursements from vendors for fiscal 2006 earlier in the year, partially offset by the expected impact of a significantly lower benefit from inventory cost capitalization than the Company experienced in fiscal 2005.
Store Openings
The Company opened three new stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, bringing its store count at the end of the second quarter to 329 stores. The Company anticipates opening a total of five new stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and opening a total of approximately 20 new stores during fiscal 2006.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EDT) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2006 second quarter. The webcast will
 
be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
 
 
 
 
THIS NOTICE IS GIVEN pursuant to an Order of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (the "Court") in the above captioned putative derivative Litigation. Plaintiff brought this action (the Litigation") derivatively on behalf of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation ("Big 5" or the "Company").
 
This Notice is given to advise you that a hearing (the "Settlement Hearing") will be held for the Litigation on December 4, 2006, at 8:30 a.m. at the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Central Civil West Courthouse, 600 South Commonwealth Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90005, Department 324, to: (a) determine the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the terms and conditions of a proposed stipulated settlement between the parties to the Litigation (the "Settlement"); (b) determine whether the Court should finally approve the Settlement and enter a Final Judgment and Order of dismissal thereon; and (c) rule upon the agreed-to fee award for Plaintiff's Counsel.
 
Even though you are receiving this Notice, the Court has not expressed any opinion as to the merits of any claim or defense that has been or may be asserted in the Litigation.
 
THE FOLLOWING RECITATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE COURT. IT IS BASED ON THE STATEMENTS OF THE PARTIES AND SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES RAISED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES.
 
 
On August 8, 2005, Plaintiff filed the Litigation in Los Angeles County Superior Court under the caption , Case No. BC337945. On November 18, 2005, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Derivative Complaint (the "Amended Complaint"). The Litigation substantially relates to the Company's February 9, 2005, announcement that it would restate certain financial statements contained in its Annual Reports for fiscal years ending 2002 and 2003, to correct for an accounting error that resulted in an overstatement of the Company's net income for 2001, 2002 and 2003 (the "Restatement").
Childers v. Bane, et al.
 
On January 20, 2006, Defendants filed various demurrers to the Amended Complaint. At a hearing on April 3, 2006, the Court granted Defendants' demurrers as to the First and Second causes of action without leave to amend, and as to the Third and Fourth causes of action with leave to amend. The Court also allowed Plaintiff to seek discovery limited to that permitted under 8 Del. C.  220. On April 10, 2006, Plaintiff served discovery demands on Big 5, in response to which Big 5 produced documents on May 16, 2006.
 
Prior to the filing of any further amendment to the complaint, and following arms-length negotiations, the parties came to an agreement to settle the Litigation.
 
 
Plaintiff believes that the claims asserted in the Litigation have merit. However, Plaintiff recognizes and acknowledges the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Litigation against the Defendants through trial and, potentially, through appeals. Plaintiff has also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex Litigations such as this action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiff is also mindful of the inherent problems of proof under and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Litigation. Based on his evaluation, and the evaluation of his counsel, Plaintiff has determined that the Settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of all parties.
 
The Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny each and every allegation of wrongdoing or liability against them arising out of any of the conduct, statements, acts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Litigation. The Defendants also have denied and continue to deny, , the allegations that Plaintiff or Big 5 or its stockholders have suffered damages by the conduct alleged in the Litigation. Indeed, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors completed a thorough investigation into the matters relating to the Restatement raised in the Litigation (the "Investigation"), including the hiring of outside counsel and outside forensic accounting firms to assist with the Investigation. As a result of that Investigation, the Company found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing. Accordingly, Defendants have asserted that no grounds for liability exist with regard to the Litigation, and that at all relevant times they acted in good faith, and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Big 5 and Big 5 stockholders.
inter alia
and/or
 
Nonetheless, the Defendants have concluded that further litigation would be protracted and expensive, and that it is desirable that the Litigation be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. The Defendants also have taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases such as this Litigation. The Defendants have, therefore, determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Litigation be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation.
 
 
Coincident with the Company's identification of the need to restate certain financial statements that forms the basis of Plaintiff's allegations in the Litigation, the Company's Audit Committee launched a thorough Investigation
 
into the matter, including hiring outside counsel and outside forensic accounting firms to assist with the Investigation. Defendants acknowledge that the Litigation preceded the adoption or implementation of certain measures, internal controls and procedures by Big 5 arising out of that Investigation. Such measures, internal controls and procedures relate to certain of the allegations raised in the Litigation, and as such confer a benefit to Big 5, including:
 
1. hiring a new Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who is a certified public accountant (CPA) with a strong background in GAAP and public reporting, to be the company's principal financial and accounting officer;
 
2. hiring three additional CPAs with GAAP and public reporting experience as the Company's Vice President and Controller, Director of Internal Audit, and Manager of Financial Reporting, and hiring additional accounting and finance staff;
 
3. implementing a policy requiring increased training and continuing education for certain members of Accounting Department management, including persons with the responsibilities of CFO, Controller and Treasurer (including Assistants);
 
4. providing additional management oversight and review of supporting account analysis, including Accounts Payable balances;
 
5. performing certain reconciliations quarterly (rather than annually);
 
6. establishing written procedures for journal entry preparation and approval responsibilities; and
 
7. adopting additional written procedures to ensure that manual journal entries are properly classified, specific general ledger accounts are utilized and proper supporting documentation is created and retained.
 
The Settling Parties believe that the foregoing corporate governance measures will substantially benefit the Company and its stockholders.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 6, 2006  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 third quarter ended October 1, 2006.
For the fiscal 2006 third quarter, net sales increased $16.4 million, or 7.9%, to $223.3 million from net sales of $206.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Same store sales increased 3.8% for the third quarter, representing the Company's 43rd consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2006 third quarter increased 5.6% to $77.7 million from $73.5 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 34.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 versus 35.6% in the third quarter of the prior year, primarily reflecting higher distribution center costs over the prior year in connection with the Company's operation of a new larger distribution center and a significantly lower benefit from inventory cost capitalization than the Company experienced last year.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 26.4% in the fiscal 2006 third quarter from 27.9% in the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to the Company's leveraging of store-related expenses during the quarter, a reduction in legal and audit fees resulting from additional expense in the third quarter of last year related to the Company's restatement of prior period financial
 
statements and the recording of co-op advertising cost reimbursements from vendors for fiscal 2006 earlier in the year.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to $7.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, from net income of $7.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 include a pre-tax charge of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options. Results for the fiscal 2005 third quarter benefited from the Company's receipt of $1.8 million in settlement proceeds in an eminent domain action related to a Company store.
For the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2006, net sales increased $47.2 million, or 7.9%, to $642.3 million from net sales of $595.1 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 4.0% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2006 versus the same period last year. Net income was $21.2 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2006, compared to net income of $19.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Results for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2006 include pre-tax charges totaling $1.7 million ($1.0 million after-tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options, and $1.8 million ($1.1 million after-tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, for costs incurred in the first quarter related to the transition to a new distribution center.
"We are pleased to report on the continued strong performance of our business," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Steady execution of our proven merchandising strategy enabled us to comp positively against our strongest quarterly same-store sales performance of fiscal 2005 and to achieve gains in each of our major merchandise categories of footwear, hard goods and apparel. Our positive sales and leverage of store-level and other expenses contributed to solid earnings results for the quarter. With our new distribution center continuing to increase efficiencies in our distribution and store-level operations, we believe that we are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season."
Share Repurchase
During the fiscal 2006 third quarter, the Company repurchased 64,310 shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's share repurchase program, for a total expenditure of $1.3 million. Following these repurchases, the Company has $13.7 million of availability remaining under its $15.0 million share repurchase program.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 15, 2006 to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2006.
 
Guidance
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.34 to $0.40. This includes a charge of approximately $0.02 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. The Company expects full-year same store sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range and full-year earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.27 to $1.33. Full-year earnings guidance includes a charge of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options. Fourth quarter earnings guidance, compared to the same period last year, reflects the unfavorable impact of the recording of co-op advertising cost reimbursements from vendors for fiscal 2006 earlier in the year, as well as a significantly lower benefit from inventory cost capitalization than the Company experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Store Openings
The Company opened five new stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, bringing its store count at the end of the third quarter to 334 stores. The Company has opened two new stores during the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter to date. The Company anticipates opening a total of nine new stores during the fourth quarter, for a total of 19 new store openings during fiscal 2006.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2006 third quarter. The webcast will be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

Integrated Corporate Relations, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., March 8, 2007  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.
For the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, net sales increased $15.6 million, or 7.1%, to $234.5 million from net sales of $218.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Same store sales increased 4.2% for the fourth quarter, representing the Company's 44th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter increased 11.7% to $83.1 million from $74.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin improved to 35.4% in the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter from 34.0% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The margin improvement was driven primarily by an increase of 60 basis points in product selling margins, a favorable reduction in inventory reserve provisions and a decline of $1.9 million in distribution center expenses due to facility transition costs incurred in the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in inventory cost capitalization from the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 25.8% in the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter versus 25.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. Contributing to this increase were lower co-op advertising cost reimbursements from vendors due to recording these reimbursements earlier in the year, and stock compensation expense that was not incurred in
 
the prior year. Excluding the effects of these items, the Company's selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to $9.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, from net income of $7.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 include a pre-tax charge of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options.
For the fiscal 2006 full year ended December 31, 2006, net sales increased $62.8 million, or 7.7%, to $876.8 million from net sales of $814.0 million for fiscal 2005. Same store sales increased 4.0% in the fiscal 2006 full year versus the prior year. Net income was $30.8 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2006 full year, compared to net income of $27.5 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2005 full year. Results for fiscal 2006 include pre-tax charges totaling $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, for the expensing of stock options.
During the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, the Company used cash from operations to prepay the remaining $8.3 million of the Company's higher interest term loan debt, and to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company's short and long-term debt at the end of fiscal 2006 totaled $77.1 million, compared to $95.4 million at the end of fiscal 2005.
"We are pleased to report an outstanding fourth quarter and full year," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We delivered strong sales and improved product margins and we leveraged store-related expenses for the quarter. We achieved sales gains in each of our three major merchandise categories of footwear, hard goods and apparel, with apparel being our strongest performing category for the quarter, benefiting in part from favorable winter weather comparisons in many of our markets. Our new distribution center contributed to our strong performance, functioning very well over our first holiday season operating exclusively out of the new facility. Our business also generated significant cash flow during the quarter, which we used to meaningfully reduce our year-end debt levels."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
As previously reported, the Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on March 15, 2007 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2007.
Guidance
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.30 to $0.33. The Company expects full-year same store sales growth in the low single-digit range and
 
full-year earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.47 to $1.57. Compared to the prior year, first quarter guidance reflects lower distribution center expenses due to facility transition costs incurred in the prior year, offset by a reduction in inventory cost capitalization.
Store Openings
The Company opened nine new stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, bringing its store count at the end of fiscal 2006 to 343 stores. During the fiscal 2007 first quarter to-date, the Company has opened three new stores, including one relocation, and has closed an additional store in preparation for its relocation during the second quarter. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2007.

The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter and full year.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 3, 2007  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 first quarter ended April 1, 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 first quarter, net sales increased $9.8 million, or 4.7%, to $217.0 million from net sales of $207.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales increased 1.0% for the first quarter, representing the Company's 45th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales comparisons.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2007 first quarter increased 6.3% to $78.0 million from $73.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin improved to 36.0% in the fiscal 2007 first quarter from 35.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. The margin improvement was driven by an increase of approximately 80 basis points in product selling margins, which benefited from sales of winter-related products earlier in the quarter at higher margins than the prior year, and a $2.2 million decrease in distribution center costs due to facility transition costs incurred in the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.4 million reduction in inventory cost capitalization from the first quarter of the prior year.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 27.6% in the fiscal 2007 first quarter from 27.7% in the first quarter of last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a $1.3 million decrease in audit and legal fees due to additional expenses
 
incurred in the prior year to complete the Company's financial statement and internal control audits, and the Company's leveraging of store-related expenses. These benefits were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in advertising expense primarily to support the Company's sales and store growth.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $7.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, from net income of $5.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2007.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
For the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the flat to low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.33. Second quarter earnings guidance reflects lower than anticipated sales beginning in the second half of April and, compared to the prior year, reflects lower distribution center expenses offset by a reduction in inventory cost capitalization and higher administrative expenses to support the Company's financial reporting initiatives. The Company continues to expect full-year same store sales growth in the low single-digit range and full-year earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
Guidance
During the fiscal 2007 first quarter, the Company opened three new stores, including one relocation, and closed an additional store in preparation for its relocation during the second quarter. The Company operated 344 stores at the end of the first quarter and anticipates opening four new stores during the fiscal 2007 second quarter. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2007.
Store Openings
"We are pleased to have begun the year with a very strong earnings performance," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved sales and product margin gains in each of our three major merchandise categories of footwear, hard goods and apparel, while comping against our strongest quarterly same store sales performance of last year. Product margins benefited from strong sales of winter-related products early in the quarter, when margins are highest, compared to last year, when we realized very strong winter product sales late in the quarter."
Commenting on second quarter sales trends, Mr. Miller added, "While sales over the first two weeks of the second quarter were positive, they began to soften in the second half of April. We are continuing to evaluate the factors that may be contributing to these lower than anticipated sales levels. The back half of the second quarter, which includes Memorial Day,
 
Father's Day and pre-Fourth of July sales, is by far the most important part of the quarter. We believe we are well positioned with a strong merchandise and promotional plan for this period."
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EDT) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2007 first quarter. The webcast will be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
      KPMG LLP was previously the principal accountant for Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company"). On May 25, 2007, KPMG LLP was dismissed, and on May 30, 2007, Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged, as the Company's principal accountant. The decision to change accountants was approved by the audit committee of the Company's board of directors.
      During the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, and the subsequent interim period through May 25, 2007, there were no: (1) disagreements with KPMG LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement, or (2) reportable events, except that KPMG LLP advised the Company of the following material weaknesses as existing as of January 1, 2006:
      The audit reports of KPMG LLP on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006, and for the years then ended, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except as follows:
KPMG LLP's report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006, and for the year then ended, contained a separate paragraph stating that "As discussed in Note 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment."
      The audit reports of KPMG LLP on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except as follows:
KPMG LLP's report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2006 indicates that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2006 because of the effect of material weaknesses on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria and contains an explanatory paragraph identifying the material weaknesses described above.
      During the last two fiscal years, and during any subsequent interim period, the Company did not consult with Deloitte & Touche LLP prior to engagement regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event.
      A letter from KPMG LLP addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We were previously principal accountants for Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the Company) and, under the date of March 9, 2007, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. On May 25, 2007 we were dismissed. We have read the Company's statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K dated May 25, 2007, and we agree with such statements except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with the statements made in the first paragraph that Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged as principal accountants and that the change was approved by the audit committee of the Company's board of directors and we are not in a position to agree or disagree with the statements in the fifth paragraph that the Company did not consult with Deloitte & Touche LLP.

On June 19, 2007, the stockholders of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") approved the Company's 2007 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan had previously been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval. The principal features of the Plan are summarized below. This summary, however, is not intended to be a complete discussion of all of the terms of the Plan. A copy of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report, along with a copy of the Form of Option Grant Notice and Stock Option Agreement for use in connection with the Plan.
 
Shares Subject to the Plan
 
Up to an aggregate of 2,399,250 shares of common stock of the Company, plus any shares subject to awards granted under the Company's previously existing stock option plans (the "Prior Plans") which are forfeited, expire or are cancelled after April 24, 2007 (the effective date of the Plan), are authorized for issuance under the Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares which may be subject to ISOs (as defined below) will be 2,399,250 shares. Any shares that are subject to awards of options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against this limit as one share for every one share granted, regardless of the number of shares actually delivered pursuant to the awards. Any shares that are subject to awards other than options or stock appreciation rights (including shares delivered on the settlement of dividend equivalents) shall be counted against this limit as 2.5 shares for every one share granted. The aggregate number of shares available under the Plan and the number of shares subject to outstanding options will be increased or decreased to reflect any changes in the outstanding common stock of the Company by reason of any recapitalization, spin-off, reorganization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction.
 
If any shares subject to an award under the Plan or to an award under the Prior Plans are forfeited, expire or are cancelled without issuance of such shares, the shares shall again be available for awards under the Plan. Any shares that again become available for grant shall be added back as one share if such shares were subject to options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Plan or options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Prior Plans and as 2.5 shares if such shares were subject to awards other than options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Plan. Shares which are received or withheld by the Company to satisfy tax liabilities arising from the grant or exercise of an option or award, or as a result of the use of shares to pay the option price, shall not again be available to awards under the Plan.
 
Eligibility and Participation
 
All employees (including officers), directors, and consultants of the Company or any subsidiary are eligible for selection to receive awards under the Plan, subject to the following restrictions: (1) no ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time of grant, is not an employee of the Company or any subsidiary, and (2) no participant may be granted options or stock appreciation rights during any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 500,000 shares, (3) no participant may be granted restricted stock, performance awards other stock unit awards that are denominated in shares in any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 250,000 shares, and (4) the maximum dollar value payable to any participant in any fiscal year of the Company with respect to performance awards other stock unit awards that are valued with reference to cash or property other than shares is $2,000,000. The share limitations set forth above are subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction during any fiscal year of the Company or portion thereof. If an option or stock appreciation right expires or terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full, or if any award is cancelled, the unpurchased shares subject to that expired or terminated option or stock appreciation right or cancelled award continue to be counted against the maximum number of shares for which options or stock appreciation rights or other awards may be granted to a participant during a fiscal year of the Company. Subject to such limitations, an individual who has been granted an option or stock appreciation right or other award may, if such individual is otherwise eligible, be granted additional options or stock appreciation rights or other awards as the Committee may determine.
and/or
and/or
 
Administration of the Plan
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), consisting of two or more directors of the Company who are (a) "non-employee directors" within the meaning of of the Exchange Act, and (b) "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (as defined below) and (c) "independent directors" under Nasdaq or other applicable stock exchange rules; except that, so long as the Committee contains at least two such directors that meet the above requirements, the Committee may
Rule 16b-3
Table of Contents
also include one additional director who does not meet those criteria if he or she abstains or recuses himself or herself in connection with voting on grants and awards to all Covered Employees (as defined in the Plan) and to all officers of the Company who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Committee has extremely broad discretion and power in interpreting and operating the Plan and in determining the employees, directors and consultants who shall be participants, and the terms of individual options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards, performance awards, and dividend equivalents. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may delegate to one or more directors or officers the authority to grant awards to employees or officers who are not directors, "covered employees" whose compensation is subject to the limits of Section 162(m) of the Code, or officers subject to the short-swing rules of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. For a description of the limitation on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to certain executive officers, see " Federal Income Tax Matters  $1,000,000 Limit on Deductible Compensation."
 
Types of Awards
 
Awards under the Plan may consist of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards, performance awards, or dividend equivalents. The nature of each of such types of awards is discussed below. Each award will be made by an award agreement whose form and content shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion, consistent with the provisions of the Plan. The terms of award agreements for a particular type of award need not be uniform.
 
Type of Options
 
Two types of options may be granted under the Plan: options intended to qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and options not so qualified for favorable federal income tax treatment ("NSOs").
 
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
The Committee, in its discretion, may also issue stock appreciation rights to employees, consultants and directors of the Company. A stock appreciation right is a right to receive a payment based on the increase in the fair market value of a share after the date of grant. The Committee may determine, in its discretion, that a stock appreciation right will be paid out in cash or in shares on its exercise. The number of shares that may be issued on the exercise of a stock appreciation right shall be determined by dividing: (a) the total number of shares as to which the stock appreciation right is exercised, multiplied by the amount by which the fair market value of one share on the exercise date exceeds the fair market value of one share on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right, by (b) the fair market value of one share on the exercise date; provided, however, that fractional shares shall not be issued and in lieu thereof, a cash adjustment shall be paid. In lieu of issuing shares on the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the Committee may in its sole discretion elect to pay the cash value of such shares. The Committee will not, however, take any action regarding a stock appreciation right, or otherwise under the Plan, that could subject a participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code.
 
Restricted Stock
 
The Committee, in its discretion, may also grant awards of restricted stock to participants. Restricted stock shall be shares granted or sold to a participant that are subject to vesting restrictions based on continued employment or attainment of performance goals. Restricted stock that vests solely upon continued service of the grantee will not fully vest over a period of less than three years, but vesting may occur ratably over the vesting period.
 
Other Stock Unit Awards
 
The Committee, in its discretion, may grant other stock unit awards, which are awards valued in whole or part by reference to, or otherwise based on, shares. Other stock unit awards shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be determined by the Committee, and may be payable in the form of cash or shares. Stock unit awards that vest solely upon continued service of the grantee will not fully vest over a period of less than three years, but vesting may occur ratably over the vesting period.
Table of Contents
 
Performance Awards and Code Section 162(m) Provisions
 
The Committee, in its discretion, may issue performance awards to participants, the payment of which will be determined by the achievement of performance goals over a performance period. Upon the grant of a performance award, the Committee shall determine the relevant performance goals and the performance period.
 
The performance goals shall be based on the attainment of specified levels, or growth, of one or any combination of the following factors, or an objective formula determined at the time of the award that is based on modified or unmodified calculations of one or any combination of the following factors: net sales; pretax income before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in maintenance of the price of the shares or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before taxes; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"); an adjusted formula of EBITDA determined by the Committee; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; reductions in costs, return on invested capital of the Company or any affiliate, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the participant is primarily employed. Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. Unless the Committee determines otherwise when it sets the performance goals for an award, objective adjustments shall be made to any of the foregoing measures for items that will not properly reflect the Company's financial performance for these purposes, such as the write-off of debt issuance costs, pre-opening and development costs, gain or loss from asset dispositions, asset or other impairment charges, litigation settlement costs, and other non-routine items that may occur during the performance period. Also, unless the Committee determines otherwise in setting the performance goals for an award, such performance goals shall be applied by excluding the impact of (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, and charges for extraordinary items, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required or recommended by generally accepted accounting principles.
and/or
and/or
 
The performance period shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be shorter than one year nor longer than five years.
 
Performance awards will generally be paid only after the end of the relevant performance period, and may be paid in cash, shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment.
 
The Compensation Committee may determine, in its discretion, that performance awards granted to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deductibility limit of Section 162(m) of the Code will qualify as "performance based" compensation. The Compensation Committee may likewise determine that the vesting of restricted stock, and the vesting or payment of any other stock unit award, granted to such an executive officer will be subject to the achievement of the objective performance goals over a performance period, and thus satisfy the requirements to be "performance based" compensation.
 
In the case of any performance award, restricted stock, or other stock unit award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, the performance goals and other terms and conditions of the award will be set by the Committee within the time prescribed by Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder. If the performance period is 12 months or longer, such performance goals must be set by the Committee within the first 90 days of the performance period.
 
The Committee may adjust downward, but not upward, the amount payable to any executive officer of the Company under any award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation. The Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance goals, except in the case of death or disability of the participant, or the occurrence of a change in control of the Company.
 
Before the vesting, payment, settlement or lapsing of any restrictions with respect to any award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, the Committee shall certify in writing that the applicable
Table of Contents
performance criteria have been achieved to the extent necessary for such award to qualify as "performance based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on awards intended to constitute "performance based" compensation as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such awards satisfy all requirements to constitute "performance based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m), or which are not inconsistent with such requirements.
 
Unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under applicable law or rules approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Plan at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Plan, no awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock that is not intended to be "performance based" compensation, shall be made following the date of such meeting to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m). Under currently applicable law or rules, to be duly constituted, a majority of the shares of capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote would have to be present in person or by proxy at the meeting at which stockholders vote to approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Plan.
 
Dividend Equivalents
 
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that a participant who receives an award will also be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to stock or other property dividends on shares ("dividend equivalents") with respect to the number of shares covered by the award. The Committee may also provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional shares or otherwise reinvested. In the event of a recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction, the Committee may, in its discretion, make an appropriate adjustment to dividend equivalents.
 
Option and Other Award Price
 
The purchase price for shares covered by each option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant, but if an ISO is granted to a more than 10% shareholder of the Company or its subsidiaries (measured by ownership of voting power), the purchase price of an ISO shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant. The base price for a stock appreciation right shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of shares as of the date of grant. The Committee, in its discretion, may determine the purchase price, if any, for restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards.
 
Exercisability of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights; Vesting of Restricted Stock and Other Awards
 
The Committee shall determine when and under what conditions any option or stock appreciation right shall become exercisable and when restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards shall become vested. However, the aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock of the Company (determined at the date of grant) for which ISOs (whenever granted) are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000; any options in excess of this limit shall be treated as NSOs. The purchase price of shares on the exercise of an option shall be paid in full at the time of exercise in cash or by check payable to the order of the Company, or, subject to the approval of the Committee and subject to applicable law, by the delivery of shares of common stock of the Company already owned by the participant, through a "broker's" exercise involving the immediate sale or pledge of shares with a value sufficient to pay the exercise price, or by any other method permitted by applicable law. The Committee shall determine, in its discretion, the form of any payment for restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance shares.
 
Duration of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
 
Each option or stock appreciation right shall expire on the date specified by the Committee, but all options and stock appreciation rights shall expire within 10 years of the date of grant. ISOs granted to more than 10%
Table of Contents
shareholders of the Company (measured by ownership of voting power) shall expire within five years from the date of grant.
 
No Repricing
 
The Committee has no authority to reprice any option, to reduce the base price of any stock appreciation right, or cancel any option in exchange for cash or another award when the fair market value of shares is less than the option's exercise price per share.
 
Termination of Employment
 
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason (including death or permanent disability) other than termination for cause, the participant's options that were vested and exercisable shall remain exercisable until the end of the original term or for the period determined by the Committee in the individual option agreement or otherwise, whichever expires earlier. After a participant's death, options may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the participant's rights pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Unless the Committee determines otherwise in its discretion, similar rules shall apply to stock appreciation rights. The treatment of each award of restricted stock, other stock unit award, or performance award on the termination of employment, death, or disability of the participant shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. If a participant's employment is terminated for cause, all of his awards may be immediately terminated and canceled, in the Committee's discretion.
 
Certain Corporate Transactions
 
Upon the happening of a merger, reorganization or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or other change of control events specified in the Plan, the Committee, may, in its sole discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) shorten the period during which options and stock appreciation rights are exercisable (provided they remain exercisable for at least 30 days after the date notice of such shortening is given to the participants); (ii) accelerate in whole or in part any vesting schedule to which an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, other stock unit award or performance award is subject; (iii) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity or any parent entity thereof assume the restricted stock, other stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights or options or grant replacement options or stock appreciation rights with appropriate adjustments in the option prices and adjustments in the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise; (iv) cancel options upon payment to the participants in cash of an amount that is the equivalent of the excess of the fair market value of the common stock of the Company (at the effective time of the merger, reorganization, sale or other event) over the exercise price of the option to the extent the options are vested and exercisable, and cancel stock appreciation rights by paying the value thereof; or (v) make any other modification or adjustment that the Committee deems appropriate in its discretion. The Committee may also provide for one or more of the foregoing alternatives in any particular award agreement.
 
Rights as a Stockholder
 
The recipient of an option or stock appreciation right will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Company common stock covered by an option or stock appreciation right until the date such recipient becomes a holder of record of such shares, unless the Committee, in its discretion, elects to grant the participant dividend equivalent rights in connection with such option or stock appreciation right. The recipient of restricted stock or of an other stock unit award will generally have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company issued pursuant to such award, including the right to vote such shares, but the Committee may determine that any dividends and distributions with respect to such shares will be subject to the same vesting restrictions, if any, as the underlying shares.
 
Assignability of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Awards
 
An ISO granted under the Plan shall, by its terms, be non-transferable by the participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by him or her. Any award issued under the Plan other than an ISO shall be nontransferable

by the participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or, with the consent of the Committee, during the participant's lifetime by gift to one or more members of the participant's immediate family or to a trust for their benefit.
 
Duration, Termination and Amendment of the Plan
 
The Plan became effective on April 24, 2007, subject to the approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company (which occurred on June 19, 2007). The Plan shall continue in effect for 10 years following the April 24, 2007 effective date. The Board of Directors, however, may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under applicable law or rules approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Plan at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Plan, no awards other than options or stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock that is not intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, shall be made following the date of such meeting to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m). Under currently applicable rules, to be duly constituted, a majority of the shares of capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote would have to be present in person or by proxy at the meeting at which stockholders vote to approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Plan. The suspension or termination of the Plan will generally not affect the validity of any option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, other stock unit award, performance award or dividend equivalent outstanding on the date of termination.
 
The Board of Directors may also amend the Plan at any time, except that the Board will not amend the Plan in a way which violates of the Exchange Act. The Board will not amend the Plan without obtaining stockholder approval to (a) increase the number of shares that may be the subject of awards under the Plan, (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) amend any provision prohibiting the Committee from repricing options or taking similar action, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any option, (f) amend the limits on grants of awards to any participant during a period, or (g) make any modification that requires stockholder approval under applicable law. Furthermore, no amendment of the Plan shall amend or impair any rights or obligations under any award theretofore granted under the Plan without the written consent of the holder of the affected award.
Rule 16b-3
12-month
 
New Plan Benefits
 
Awards to be received by participants in the Plan are not determinable at this time because the Committee, in its discretion, will determine the nature and performance criteria for any award provided under the Plan at the time of grants. Performance awards in particular are dependent upon a combination of performance criteria, including net sales, EBITDA, earnings per share, return on stockholders' equity, division, group or corporate financial goals, and other factors. As a result, the grants that may be awarded under the Plan are not determinable until the Committee assesses the criteria relevant to each individual participant for the particular performance period of the award. For similar reasons, the Company cannot determine the awards that would have been granted during the Company's 2006 fiscal year under the Plan if it had been in place during that year.
 
Federal Income Tax Matters
 
The following discussion of federal income tax consequences does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential tax effects of the Plan. It is based upon laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. No information is provided with respect to persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States, or foreign, state or local tax laws, or estate and gift tax considerations. In addition, the tax
Table of Contents
consequences to a particular participant may be affected by matters not discussed above.
 
The Plan is not subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
 
Non-Qualified Stock Options
 
Under current federal income tax law, the grant of an NSO has no tax effect on the Company or the participant. If the shares of common stock of the Company received on the exercise of an NSO are not subject to restrictions on transfer or risk of forfeiture, the exercise of the NSO will result in ordinary income to the participant equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the option price. The participant's tax basis in the shares will be equal to the option price plus the amount of ordinary income recognized upon the exercise of the option. Upon any subsequent disposition of the shares, any gain or loss recognized by the participant will be treated as capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year after exercise. At the time of recognition of ordinary income by the participant upon exercise, the Company will normally be allowed to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to such recognized ordinary income.
 
If the shares received on the exercise of an NSO are subject to restrictions on transfer or risk of forfeiture (e.g., a vesting condition), different rules will apply, and the tax consequences will depend on whether the participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days after exercise of the option. If the participant does not make a Section 83(b) election, the participant will recognize ordinary income when the shares vest in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value on the date of vesting over the exercise price. In that case, the participant's basis in the shares will be the fair market value of the shares on the date of vesting, and participant's holding period will begin on the date of vesting. Upon any later disposition of the shares, any gain or loss that the participant recognizes will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the participant holds the shares more than one year after vesting. The Company will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes when the shares vest equal to the amount of ordinary income the participant recognizes.
 
On the other hand, if the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value on the date of exercise over the exercise price. The Company will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes on the date of exercise equal to the amount of ordinary income he or she recognizes. The participant's basis in the shares will generally begin on the date of exercise, and the participant's basis in the shares will generally be the option price increased by the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized at the time of exercise. Upon any later disposition of the shares, any gain or loss that the participant recognizes will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the participant holds the shares more than one year after exercise. However, if the participant later forfeits the shares, the participant will recognize a capital loss equal to excess (if any) of the option price over any amount the participant receives from the Company on the forfeiture. In other words, if a participant makes the Section 83(b) election and thereby recognizes ordinary income on the date of exercise, the participant will receive no corresponding deduction or loss if the participant later forfeits the shares for the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized.
 
Incentive Stock Options
 
The federal income tax consequences associated with ISOs are generally more favorable to the participant and less favorable to the Company than those associated with NSOs. Under current federal income tax law, the grant of an ISO does not result in income to the participant or in a deduction for the Company at the time of the grant. Generally, the exercise of an ISO will not result in income for the participant if the participant does not dispose of the shares within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the date of exercise. If these requirements are met, the basis of the shares of common stock of the Company upon a later disposition will be the option price, any gain on the later disposition will be taxed to the participant as long-term capital gain, and the Company will not
Table of Contents
be entitled to a deduction. The excess of the market value on the exercise date over the option price is an adjustment to regular taxable income in determining alternative minimum taxable income, which could cause the participant to be subject to the alternative minimum tax, thereby in effect depriving the participant of the tax benefits of ISO treatment. If the participant disposes of the shares before the expiration of either of the holding periods described above (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the participant will have compensation taxable as ordinary income, and the Company will normally be entitled to a deduction, equal to the lesser of (a) the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date minus the option price, or (b) the amount realized on the disposition minus the option price. If the price realized in any such Disqualifying Disposition of the shares exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date, the excess will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain, depending on the participant's holding period for the shares.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
A participant holding a stock appreciation right will recognize ordinary income on the exercise of the stock appreciation right equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of the shares he receives on the exercise. The Company will receive a tax deduction in the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
 
Other Awards
 
The taxation of an award other than an option or a stock appreciation right depends on whether or not it consists of restricted stock (i.e., stock subject to a vesting restriction based on continued employment or attainment of performance goals). If an other stock unit award or a performance award does not consist of restricted stock, and is not settled in restricted stock, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the receipt of cash or shares equal to the amount of cash, or the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the amount (if any) that the participant pays for the shares. The Company will receive a tax deduction in the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
 
In general, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant at the time restricted stock is granted. Generally, on the date the restricted stock becomes vested, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares vest and the purchase price, and the Company will receive a tax deduction for the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of vesting as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
 
Alternatively, a participant may elect to make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to unvested shares. If a participant makes a Section 83(b) election with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date of grant, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and the purchase price, and the Company will receive a tax deduction for the same amount. If the participant makes a timely Section 83(b) election, the participant will not recognize ordinary income when the shares vest. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held. If the participant forfeits unvested shares, the participant will recognize a capital loss equal to the excess (if any) of the purchase price over any amount the participant receives from the Company on the forfeiture. Generally, if the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, and thereby recognizes ordinary income on the date of grant, the participant will receive no corresponding deduction or loss for the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized if the participant later forfeits any unvested shares.
 
$1,000,000 Limit on Deductible Compensation
 
Section 162(m) of the Code provides that any publicly-traded corporation will be denied a deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers to the extent that the compensation exceeds $1,000,000 per officer
Table of Contents
per year. However, the deduction limit does not apply to "performance based" compensation, as defined in Section 162(m). Compensation is performance based compensation if (i) the compensation is payable on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals; (ii) the performance goals are established by a compensation committee of the Board of Directors of directors consisting of "outside directors"; (iii) the material terms of the compensation and the performance goals are disclosed to and approved by the stockholders in a separate vote; and (iv) the compensation committee certifies that the performance goals have been satisfied. The Company believes that, if the stockholders approve the Plan, the stock options and stock appreciation rights granted thereunder will satisfy the requirements to be treated as performance based compensation, and accordingly will not be subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Code. As discussed above, the Committee may determine that restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards granted to executive officers whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) will also qualify as performance based compensation. Restricted stock whose vesting is based solely on the completion by the recipient of a stated period of service with the Company will not qualify as performance based compensation.
 
Excess Parachute Payments
 
Under Section 4999 of the Code, certain officers, stockholders, or highly- compensated individuals ("Disqualified Individuals") will be subject to an excise tax (in addition to federal income taxes) of 20% of the amount of certain "excess parachute payments" which they receive as a result of a change in control of the Company. Furthermore, Section 280G of the Code prevents the Company from taking a deduction for any "excess parachute payments." The cash out or acceleration of the vesting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards or performance awards upon a change of control may cause the holders of such stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards and performance awards who are Disqualified Individuals to recognize certain amounts as "excess parachute payments" on which they must pay the 20% excise tax, and for which the Company will be denied a tax deduction.
 
Special Rules; Withholding of Taxes
 
Special tax rules may apply to a participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Other special tax rules will apply if a participant exercises a stock option by delivering shares of Company common stock which he or she already owns, or through a "broker's exercise."
 
The Company may take whatever steps the Committee deems appropriate to comply with any applicable withholding tax obligation in connection with the exercise of an option or stock appreciation right or the grant or vesting of restricted stock, other stock unit awards, or performance awards, including requiring any participant to pay the amount of any applicable withholding tax to the Company in cash. The Committee may, in its discretion, authorize "cashless withholding."

(b) If any Shares subject to an Award or to an award under the Prior Plans are forfeited, expire or otherwise terminate without issuance of such Shares, or any Award or award under the Prior Plans is settled for cash or otherwise does not result in the issuance of all or a portion of the Shares subject to such Award, the Shares shall, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration, termination, cash settlement or non-issuance, again be available for Awards under the Plan, subject to Section 3.1(e) below.
 
(c) In the event that (i) any Option or other Award granted under this Plan or any option or award granted under the Prior Plans is exercised through the tendering of Shares (either actually, by attestation, or by the giving of instructions to a broker to remit to the Company that portion of the sales price required to pay the exercise price) or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, or (ii) withholding tax liabilities arising from such Options or Awards under this Plan or options or awards under a Prior Plan are satisfied by the tendering of Shares (either actually, by attestation, or by the giving of instructions to a broker to remit to the Company that portion of the sales price required to pay the exercise price) or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, then the Shares so tendered or withheld shall not again be available for Awards under the Plan.
 
(d) Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares authorized for issuance under the Plan or authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year. Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary, or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines, has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for issuance under the Plan; provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were employees, directors or consultants of such acquired or combined company before such acquisition or combination.
 
(e) Any Shares that again become available for grant pursuant to this Article 3 shall be added back as one Share if such Shares were subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan or options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Prior Plans, and as 2.5 Shares if such Shares were subject to Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan.
 
3.2    Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12.2, no Participant may be granted (i) Options or Stock Appreciation Rights during any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 500,000 Shares, or (ii) Restricted Stock, Performance Awards Other Stock Unit Awards that are denominated in Shares in any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 250,000 Shares (the "").

(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, constituted as follows:
 
(i) The Committee will consist of the Board, or a committee designated by the Board, which Committee will be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws. Once appointed, a Committee will serve in its designated capacity until otherwise directed by the Board. The Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members, remove members (with or without cause) and substitute new members, fill vacancies (however caused), and remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Board expressly resolves to the contrary, while the Company is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, the Plan will be administered only by the Compensation Committee of the Board (or such other committee designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board), consisting of no fewer than two Directors, each of whom is (A) a "non-employee director" within the meaning of (or any successor rule) of the Exchange Act, (B) an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C)(i) of the Code, and (C) an "independent director" for purpose of the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market System or other exchange or quotation system on which the Shares are principally traded; provided, however, (X) so long as the Committee has at least two directors that meet the above requirements, the Committee may contain one additional director who is not a "non-employee director", "outside director" or "independent director", but only if such director abstains from voting on all grants or awards to Covered Employees and to those Participants who have been designated by the Board of Directors as being "officers" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and (Y) the failure of the Committee to be composed solely of individuals who are "non-employee directors," "outside directors," and "independent directors", whether pursuant to clause (X) above or otherwise, shall not render ineffective or void any awards or grants made by, or other actions taken by, such Committee.
Rule 16b-3
 
(ii) The Plan may be administered by different bodies with respect to Directors, officers who are not Directors, and Employees and Consultants who are neither Directors nor officers, and Covered Employees.
 
(b) The Committee shall have full discretion, power and authority, subject to the provisions of the Plan and subject to such orders or resolutions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as may from time to time be adopted by the Board, to: (i) select the Employees, Consultants and Directors to whom Awards may from time to time be granted hereunder; (ii) determine the type or types of Awards, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, to be granted to each Participant hereunder; (iii) determine the number of Shares to be covered by each Award granted hereunder; (iv) determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder and the form and content of any Award Agreement; (v) determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances Awards may be settled in cash, Shares or other property, subject to the provisions of the Plan; (vi) determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances any Award shall be modified, amended, canceled or suspended; (vii) interpret and administer the Plan and any instrument or agreement entered into under or in connection with the Plan, including any Award Agreement; (viii) correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent that the Committee shall deem desirable to carry it into effect; (ix) establish such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; (x) determine whether any Award will have Dividend Equivalents; (xi) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances cash, Shares, or other property payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the Participant;
 
provided that the Committee shall take no action that would subject the Participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code; and (xii) make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for administration of the Plan.
 
(c) Decisions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons or entities, including the Company, any Participant, any stockholder and any Employee or any Affiliate. A majority of the members of the Committee may determine its actions and fix the time and place of its meetings.
 
(d) The Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more Directors of the Company or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to one or more officers or a committee of officers, the authority to grant Awards to Employees and officers of the Company who are not Directors, Covered Employees, or "officers," as such term is defined by of the Exchange Act, and to cancel or suspend Awards to Employees and officers of the Company who are not Directors, Covered Employees, or "officers," as such term is defined by of the Exchange Act.

Grant of Options.
 
5.2    All Options granted pursuant to this Article 5 shall be evidenced by a written Award Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. Granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall impose no obligation on the recipient to exercise such Option.

5.3    Other than in connection with Substitute Awards, the option price per each Share purchasable under any Option granted pursuant to this Article 5 shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the date of grant of such Option. Other than pursuant to Section 12.2, the Committee shall not be permitted to (a) lower the option price per Share of an Option after it is granted, (b) cancel an Option when the option price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for cash or for another Award (other than in connection with Substitute Awards), and (c) take any other action with respect to an Option that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market System or other exchange or quotation system on which the Shares are principally traded.
Option Price.
 
5.4    The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date the Option is granted.
Option Period.
 
5.5    Vested Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the Participant or by a Permitted Assignee thereof (or by the Participant's executors, administrators, guardian, beneficiary, or legal representative, or Family Members, as may be provided in an Award Agreement) as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby, by the giving of written notice of exercise to the Company or its designated agent, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the Shares being purchased. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, full payment of such purchase price shall be made at the time of exercise and shall be made (a) in cash or by certified check or bank check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, (b) with the consent of the Committee, by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), (c) with the consent of the Committee, by delivery of other consideration (including, where permitted by law and the Committee, other Awards) having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the total purchase price, (d) with the consent of the Committee, by withholding Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option, (e) with the consent of the Committee, by delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with any other documentation
Exercise of Options.
 
as the Committee and the Participant's broker, if applicable, require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to the Company of the sale or other proceeds (as permitted by Applicable Law) required to pay the exercise price, , (f) through any other method specified in an Award Agreement, or (g) any combination of any of the foregoing. In connection with a tender of previously acquired Shares pursuant to clause (b) above, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit the Participant to constructively exchange Shares already owned by the Participant in lieu of actually tendering such Shares to the Company, provided that adequate documentation concerning the ownership of the Shares to be constructively tendered is furnished in form satisfactory to the Committee. The notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Committee may from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. In no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance.
 
5.6    In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or other similar securities, or may reserve the right so to provide after the time of grant.
Form of Settlement.
 
5.7    With respect to the Options that may be granted by the Committee under the Plan, the Committee may grant Options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options to any Employee of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, subject to the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. The Award Agreement of an Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option shall designate the Option as an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.1 to the contrary and solely for the purposes of determining whether Shares are available for the grant of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options may be granted under the Plan shall be 2,399,250 Shares. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five years from the date of grant or any shorter term specified in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Shares subject to an Employee's Incentive Stock Options (granted under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary), which become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year, have a Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000, the Options accounting for this excess will be not be treated as Incentive Stock Options. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time of grant.
Incentive Stock Options.
 
5.8    If a Participant holds exercisable Options on the date his or her Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than because of termination due to Cause, but including death or Disability), the Participant may exercise the Options that were vested and exercisable as of the date of termination until the end of the original term or for the period set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee, whichever is earlier. If the Participant is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option at the date of such termination, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option will revert to the Plan, unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee. The Committee may determine in its sole discretion that such unexercisable portion of the Option will become exercisable at such times and on such terms as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. If the Participant does not exercise an Option within the time specified after termination, that Option will expire, and the Shares covered by it will revert to the Plan, except as otherwise determined by the Committee.

Terms and Conditions.
 
(a) Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right on the date of grant, which, except in the case of Substitute Awards or in connection with an adjustment provided in Section 12.2, shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on such date of grant of the right.
 
(b) Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, payment shall be made in whole Shares or cash as determined by the Committee.
 
(c) The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
(d) The Committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on the terms of exercise and the exercise price of any Stock Appreciation Right, as it shall deem appropriate. In connection with the foregoing, the Committee shall consider the applicability and effect of Section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2, but subject to Section 12.2, a Stock Appreciation Right shall not have (i) an exercise price less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant, or (ii) a term of greater than ten years. In addition to the foregoing, but subject to Section 12.2, the base amount of any Stock Appreciation Right shall not be reduced after the date of grant.
 
6.3    If a Participant holds exercisable Stock Appreciation Rights on the date his or her Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than because of termination due to Cause, but including death or Disability), the Participant may exercise the Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested and exercisable as of the date of termination until the end of the original term or for the period set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee, whichever is earlier. If the Participant is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Stock Appreciation Right at the date of such termination, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right will revert to the Plan, unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee. The Committee may determine in its sole discretion that such unexercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right will become exercisable at such times and on such terms as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. If the Participant does not exercise a Stock Appreciation Right within the time specified after termination, that Stock Appreciation Right will expire, and the Shares covered by it will revert to the Plan, except as otherwise determined by the Committee.

7.1    Awards of Restricted Stock may be issued hereunder to Participants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan (a "").

The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether any consideration (other than services) is to be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the issuance of Restricted Stock.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees, Consultants and Directors to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Unit Awards shall be made, the number of Shares to be granted pursuant to such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards; provided, however, that if the vesting of an Other Stock Unit Award is based solely on the recipient's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant, the period over which such Other Stock Unit Award fully vests shall not be less than three years, but vesting may occur ratably over such vesting period. The provisions of Other Stock Unit Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.

9.1    Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by Applicable Law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan. The performance criteria to be achieved during any Performance Period and the length of the Performance Period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided, however, that a Performance Period shall not be shorter than one year nor longer than five years. Except as provided in Article 11 or as may be provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant Performance Period. Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. The performance goals to be achieved for each Performance Period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 10.2. The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee. The terms of a Performance Award may provide that it will be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the Performance Period.
Terms of Performance Awards.
 
 
 
 
10.1    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee determines at the time Restricted Stock, a Performance Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is granted to a Participant who is, or is likely to be, as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, and that the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Code might apply to such Award, then the Committee may provide that this Article 10 is applicable to such Award.
Covered Employees.
 
10.2    If Restricted Stock, a Performance Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is subject to this Article 10, then the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of cash, Shares or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Committee, which shall be based on the attainment of specified levels, or growth, of one or any combination of the following factors, or an objective formula that is determined at the time of the Award that is based on modified or unmodified calculations of one or any combination of the following factors: net sales; pretax income before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in maintenance of the price of the Shares or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before taxes; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""); an adjusted formula of EBITDA determined by the Committee; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; reductions in costs, return on invested capital of the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed. Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise when it sets the performance goals for an award, objective adjustments shall be made to any of the foregoing measures for items that will not properly reflect the Company's financial performance for these purposes, such as the write-off of debt issuance costs, pre-opening and development costs, gain or loss from asset dispositions, asset or other impairment charges, litigation settlement costs, and other non-routine items that the Committee foresees may occur during the Performance Period. Also, unless the Committee determines otherwise in setting the performance goals for an Award, such performance goals shall be applied by excluding the impact of (a) restructurings, discontinued operations and charges for extraordinary items, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.

Adjustments.
 
10.4    Prior to the vesting, payment, settlement or lapsing of any restrictions with respect to any Restricted Stock, Performance Award or Other Stock Unit Award that is subject to this Article 10, the Committee shall certify in writing that the applicable performance goals have been achieved to the extent necessary for such Award to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.
Determination of Performance.
 
10.5    The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Article 10 as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, or which are not inconsistent with such requirements.
Restrictions.
 
 
 
 
11.1    The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award, or the Committee may determine in its discretion, that, upon a Change of Control of the Company, (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change of Control immediately vest and become exercisable in full or in part, (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock lapse and the Restricted Stock becomes free of some or all restrictions and limitations and becomes partially or fully vested, (c) Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable (either in full or pro-rata based on the portion of Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change of Control), and any deferral or other restriction shall lapse and such Performance Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed, (d) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Stock Unit Awards or any other Awards shall lapse in full or in part, and such Other Stock Unit Awards or such other Awards shall become free of some or all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become partially or fully vested and transferable, and (e) such other additional benefits, changes or adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate shall apply, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company, (a) each Option and Stock Appreciation Right shall remain exercisable for only a limited period of time determined by the Committee (provided that they remain exercisable for at least 30 days after notice of such action is given to the Participants), or (b) each Option and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the Participant, and such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control over the exercise price per share of such Option Stock Appreciation Right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Section 11.2, the Committee will take no action that would subject any Participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code.
Impact of Change of Control.
and/or
 
11.2    The terms of any Award Agreement may also provide that, if in the event of a Change of Control the successor company assumes or substitutes for an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award, then each outstanding Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award shall not be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1(a), (b) and (d). For the purposes of this Section 11.2, an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award shall be considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change of Control the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award or Other Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a Change of Control by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award or Other Stock Unit Award, for each Share subject thereto, will be solely common stock of the successor company substantially equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction constituting a Change of Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination shall be conclusive and binding. Any assumption or substitution of an Incentive Stock Option will be made in a manner that will not be considered a "modification" under the provisions of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Award Agreement may provide that, in the event of a termination of a Participant's employment in such successor company within a specified time period following such Change of Control, all or part of any such Award held by such Participant at the time of the Change of Control shall be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1(a), (b) and (d) above.
Assumption Upon Change of Control.
 
 
 
 
12.1    The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by Applicable Law; provided that the Board may not amend the Plan in any manner that would result in noncompliance with of the Exchange Act; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.2), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) amend any provision of Section 5.3, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option specified by Section 5.4, or (f) amend any provision of Section 3.2. In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan (other than by reason of the failure of stockholders to approve the Plan in the manner set forth in Section 13.12) shall in any way impair the rights of a Participant under any Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.

12.2    In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares or the value thereof, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in the aggregate number, class and kind of securities that may be delivered under the Plan and, in the aggregate or to any one Participant, in the number, class, kind and option or exercise price of securities subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company) as the Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. Where an adjustment under this Section 12.2 is made to an Incentive Stock Option, the adjustment will be made in a manner which will not be considered a "modification" under the provisions of Sections 409A or 424(h)(3) of the Code.
Adjustments.
 
12.3    Except as provided below, no Award, and no Shares subject to Awards that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such Award may be exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Committee so authorizes in the Award Agreement or otherwise, an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option may be assigned, in whole or in part, during the Participant's lifetime to one or more Family Members of the Participant. Rights under the assigned portion may be exercised by the Family Member(s) who acquire a proprietary interest in such Award pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the Award immediately before such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Committee deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards.
 
(a)   A Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any Awards that remain unexercised in the event of the Participant's death. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for the designation to be effective. The Participant may change such designation of beneficiary at any time by written notice to the Committee, subject to the above spousal consent requirement.
Designation of Beneficiary.
 
(b)   If a Participant dies and there is no beneficiary validly designated and living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will deliver such Participant's Awards to the executor or administrator of his or her estate, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such Awards to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
Effect of No Designation.
 
(c)   If a Participant designates his or her spouse as beneficiary, that designation will be deemed automatically revoked if the Participant's marriage is later dissolved. Similarly, any
Death of Spouse or Dissolution of Marriage.
 
designation of a beneficiary will be deemed automatically revoked upon the death of the beneficiary if the beneficiary predeceases the Participant. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the interest in Awards of a spouse of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant or whose marriage has been dissolved will automatically pass to the Participant, and will not be transferable by such spouse in any manner, including but not limited to such spouse's will, nor will any such interest pass under the laws of intestate succession.
 
12.4    The Committee shall determine and set forth in each Award Agreement whether any Awards granted in such Award Agreement will continue to be exercisable, and the terms of such exercise, on and after the date that a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant ceases, whether by reason of death, disability, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or services, or otherwise. The date of termination of a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant will be determined by the Committee, which determination will be final.
Termination of Employment.
 
12.5    Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to stock or other property dividends on Shares ("") with respect to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested.
Dividend Equivalents.

13.1    The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (or to the Participant's executors, administrators, guardian, beneficiary, or legal representative, or Family Members) (any such person, a "") net of any applicable Federal, State and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Rights, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award, or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Payee such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Payee to pay such withholding taxes. If the Payee shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Payee or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the employee's minimum required tax withholding rate) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award. If Shares acquired upon exercise of any Incentive Stock Option are disposed of in a disposition that, under Section 422 of the Code, disqualifies the holder from the application of Section 421(a) of the Code, the holder of the Shares immediately before the disposition will comply with any requirements imposed by the Company in order to enable the Company to secure the related income tax deduction to which it is entitled in such event.
Tax Withholding.
Payee
 
13.2    Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Employee, Consultant or Director the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such Employee, Consultant or Director at any time for any reason. The Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Awards.
 
 
13.3    The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise complied with the then applicable terms and conditions.
Prospective Recipient.
 
13.4    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant may be canceled in the discretion of the Committee if the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant is terminated for Cause, or if, after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant, the Committee determines that Cause existed before such termination.
Cancellation of Award.
 
13.5    All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the provisions of this Plan, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
Stop Transfer Orders.
 
13.6    All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan and any Stock Appreciation Rights constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
Nature of Payments.
 
13.7    Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
Other Plans.
 
13.8    If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.

With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.

Governing Law.
 
13.12    The Plan shall be effective on April 24, 2007, subject to the approval of the Plan, within 12 months thereafter, by affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under Applicable Laws at a duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company. After the adoption of this Plan by the Board, Awards may be made, but all such Awards shall be subject to stockholder approval of this Plan in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 13.12, and no Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised prior to such stockholder approval of the Plan. If the stockholders do not approve this Plan in the manner set forth in the first sentence of this Section 13.12, this Plan, and all Awards granted hereunder, shall be null and void and of no effect. Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan (unless the Board sooner suspends or terminates the Plan under Section 12.1), on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under Applicable Laws approve the continuation of Article 10 at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of this Plan, no Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or Restricted Stock that is not intended to satisfy the requirements of Article 10, shall be made to Covered Employees following the date of such meeting. Except as set forth in the third sentence of this Section 13.12, outstanding Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired.
Effective Date of Plan; Termination of Plan.
 
13.13    Awards may be granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law or tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home country.
Foreign Employees.
 
13.14    On the approval of this Plan by the stockholders of the Company in the manner set forth in Section 13.12, the Prior Plans shall be cancelled and no further grants or awards shall be made under the Prior Plans. Grants and awards made under the Prior Plans before the date of such cancellation, however, shall continue in effect in accordance with their terms.
Effect on Prior Plans.
 
13.15    Shares available for Awards under the Plan may be used by the Company as a form of payment of compensation under other Company compensation plans, whether or not existing on the date hereof. To the extent any Shares are used as such by the Company, such Shares will reduce the then number of Shares available under Article 3 of the Plan for future Awards.

Pursuant to the Grant Notice, the Company has granted to the Optionee the right and option to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement, all or any part of the number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company set forth on the Grant Notice at a purchase price per share equal to the exercise price per Share set forth on the Grant Notice. If the Grant Notice indicates (under "Type of Option") that this Option is an "ISO", then this Option is intended by the Company and Optionee to be an Incentive Stock Option. However, if the Grant Notice indicates that this Option is a "NQSO", then this Option is not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option and is instead intended to be a Nonqualified Stock Option.
Grant of Option

Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the other provisions of this Agreement, this Option shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant for any reason, with or without Cause, including as a result of death or Disability, this Option shall immediately cease vesting and shall be cancelled to the extent of the number of Shares as to which this Option has not vested as of the date of termination.

In the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant, this Option shall be cancelled as to any unvested Shares as provided in Section 1.2, and shall terminate and be cancelled with respect to any vested Shares on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the ten year period set forth in the first sentence of this Section 1.3, or (ii) 90 days after termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant (or 12 months in the case of termination as a result of Optionee's Disability or death); provided, however, if Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant is terminated for Cause, this entire Option shall be cancelled and terminated as of the date of such termination and shall no longer be exercisable as to any Shares, whether or not previously vested.
Term of Option
2.
Method of Exercise.
     2.1 . This Option shall be exercisable by written notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A which shall state the election to exercise this Option, the number of Shares in respect of which this Option is being exercised, and such other representations and agreements with respect to such Shares as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. Such written notice shall be signed by Optionee (or by Optionee's beneficiary or other person entitled to exercise this Option in the event of Optionee's death under the Plan) and shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company. The written notice shall be accompanied by payment of the exercise price. This Option shall not be deemed exercised until the Company receives such written notice accompanied by the exercise price and any other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement are satisfied. This Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Delivery of Notice of Exercise
     2.2 . No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless and until there shall have been full compliance with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (whether by registration or satisfaction of exemption conditions), all Applicable Laws, and all applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange or other market system on which the Common Stock is then listed. As a condition to the exercise of this Option, the Company may require Optionee to make any representation and warranty to the Company as may be necessary or appropriate, in the judgment of the Administrator, to comply with any Applicable Law.
Restrictions on Exercise
     2.3 . Payment of the exercise price shall be made in full at the time of exercise in cash or by check payable to the order of the Company, or, subject in each case to the advance approval of the Administrator in its sole discretion, (a) by delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by Optionee having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price and held for at least six months (or for such other period as is necessary to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), (b) by a "broker's exercise" involving the sale, at the time of the exercise of the Option, of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price, and the simultaneous remission of the exercise price to the Company, or (c) by any combination of the foregoing. Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of this Option shall be valued at their Fair Market Value determined on the date of exercise (or if such date is not a business day, as of the close of the business day immediately preceding such date). In addition, the Administrator may impose such other conditions in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock in satisfaction of the exercise price as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation a requirement that the shares
Method of Payment
 
of Common Stock delivered have been held by the Optionee for a specified period of time.
     2.4 . If this Option is an Incentive Stock Option and the Optionee sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired upon exercise of this Option on or before the later of (i) two years after the date of grant, or (ii) one year after the date such Shares were acquired, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. The Optionee agrees that he or she may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the taxable income recognized as a result of such disposition and that the Optionee shall be required to satisfy such withholding obligations either by making a payment to the Company in cash or by withholding from current earnings of the Optionee.
Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of Incentive Stock Option
3. . This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or to a beneficiary designated pursuant to the Plan, and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. Subject to all of the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, following the death of Optionee, this Option may, to the extent it remained unexercised (but vested and exercisable by Optionee in accordance with its terms) on the date of death, be exercised by Optionee's beneficiary or other person entitled to exercise this Option in the event of Optionee's death under the Plan. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 3, (i) if this Option is a Nonqualified Stock Option, this Option may be assigned pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code, and exercised by the spouse of the Optionee who obtained such Option pursuant to such qualified domestic relations order, and (ii) this Option may be assigned, during the Optionee's lifetime, to one or more Family Members. Rights under the assigned portion may be exercised by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in such Option pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the Option immediately before such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Administrator deems appropriate.

     4.5 . In the event any capital stock of the Company or any other corporation shall be distributed on, with respect to, or in exchange for shares of Common Stock as a stock dividend, stock split, reclassification or recapitalization in connection with any merger or reorganization or otherwise, all restrictions, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement shall apply with respect to such other capital stock to the same extent as they are, or would have been applicable, to the Option Shares on or with respect to which such other capital stock was distributed.

Successors and Assigns
     4.9 . Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Optionee may not assign any of his, her or its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. The Company shall be permitted to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement, but no such assignment shall release the Company of any obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

     4.10 . The validity, legality or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected even if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.
Severability
 
     4.11 . The Optionee acknowledges that, in the event of a threatened or actual breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, damages alone will be an inadequate remedy, and such breach will cause the Company great, immediate and irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, the Optionee agrees that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, and that such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any remedies they may have at law or under this Agreement.
Equitable Relief
     4.12 .
Arbitration
          4.12.1 . Any controversy, dispute, or claim between the parties to this Agreement, including any claim arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, before a single arbitrator, in accordance with this section 4.12 and the then most applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for determining any such dispute, regardless of its nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may in an appropriate matter apply to a court pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.8, or any comparable provision, for provisional relief, including a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, on the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled in arbitration may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. Unless mutually agreed by the parties otherwise, any arbitration shall take place in the City of Los Angeles, California.
General
          4.12.2 . In the event the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from a list of nine arbitrators drawn by the parties at random from a list of twenty persons (which shall be retired judges or corporate or litigation attorneys experienced in stock options and buy-sell agreements) provided by the office of the American Arbitration Association having jurisdiction over Los Angeles, California. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the list so drawn, then the parties shall each strike names alternately from the list, with the first to strike being determined by lot. After each party has used four strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator. If such person is unable to serve for any reason, the parties shall repeat this process until an arbitrator is selected.
Selection of Arbitrator
          4.12.3 . This agreement to resolve any disputes by binding arbitration shall extend to claims against any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity, any officer, director, shareholder, employee or agent of each party, or of any of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising out of state and federal statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the common law. In the event of a dispute subject to this paragraph the parties shall be entitled to reasonable discovery subject to the discretion of the arbitrator. The remedial authority of the arbitrator (which shall include the right to grant injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be the same as, but no greater than, would be the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the parties and their dispute. The arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim without an evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that he or it would be entitled to
Applicability of Arbitration; Remedial Authority
 
           summary judgement if the matter had been pursued in court litigation. In the event of a conflict between the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association and these procedures, the provisions of these procedures shall govern.
          4.12.4 . Any filing or administrative fees shall be borne initially by the party requesting arbitration. The Company shall be responsible for the costs and fees of the arbitration, unless the Optionee wishes to contribute (up to 50%) to the costs and fees of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prevailing party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing party's costs (including but not limited to the arbitrator's compensation), expenses, and attorneys' fees.
Fees and Costs
          4.12.5 . The arbitrator shall render an award and written opinion, and the award shall be final and binding upon the parties. If any of the provisions of this paragraph, or of this Agreement, are determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry out its provisions to the greatest extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all conflicts between the parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration decision and award to be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action, given great weight by any finder of fact, and treated as determinative to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Award Final and Binding

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., July 12, 2007  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results and updated earnings guidance for the fiscal 2007 second quarter ended July 1, 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 second quarter, net sales increased $6.0 million, or 2.9%, to $217.8 million from net sales of $211.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales declined 0.2% for the fiscal 2007 second quarter, representing the Company's first quarterly decrease in same store sales in over eleven years. The Company now expects earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2007 second quarter to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.26, compared to previously issued earnings guidance of $0.25 to $0.33 per diluted share.
The revised second quarter earnings guidance reflects sales at the low end of the Company's previously issued sales guidance range and product margins in-line with the fiscal 2006 second quarter. Fiscal 2007 second quarter earnings guidance compared to the prior year reflects lower distribution center expenses offset by a reduction in inventory cost capitalization and higher administrative expenses to support the Company's financial reporting initiatives.
"As we announced with our first quarter results, second quarter sales began to soften in the second half of April," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The macro-economic environment remained challenging and continued to affect results throughout the quarter. With a slight increase in promotional activity, we produced positive same store sales in May and June, but those sales increases were not enough to offset the weakness in April.
"We are very proud of our outstanding track record and our positive same store sales streak, which came to an end after 45 consecutive quarters of growth amid a challenging consumer environment," continued Mr. Miller. "While we are certainly taking a hard look at our operation for ways in which we might be able to improve both our top and bottom line in the
 
current environment, we remain confident in the consistency and effectiveness of our overall business model."
The Company expects to report second quarter results during the first week of August, 2007. At that time, the Company expects to provide guidance for the fiscal 2007 third quarter and revised guidance for the fiscal 2007 full year.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., August 1, 2007  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 second quarter ended July 1, 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 second quarter, net sales increased $6.0 million, or 2.9%, to $217.8 million from net sales of $211.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales declined 0.2% for the second quarter, representing the Company's first quarterly decrease in same store sales in over eleven years.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2007 second quarter increased to $77.1 million from $76.7 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 35.4% in the fiscal 2007 second quarter versus 36.2% in the second quarter of the prior year. The gross margin performance reflected product margins generally in-line with the prior year and a $0.4 million decrease in distribution center costs as a result of operational efficiencies realized in the Company's new distribution center, offset by a $0.9 million reduction in inventory cost capitalization from the second quarter of last year.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.3% in the fiscal 2007 second quarter compared to 27.7% in the second quarter of last year, primarily reflecting softness in the Company's sales and an increase in administrative expenses to support the Company's overall growth and financial reporting initiatives.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $5.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, versus net income of $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
For the twenty-six week period ended July 1, 2007, net sales increased $15.9 million, or 3.8%, to $434.9 million from net sales of $419.0 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 0.3% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2007 versus the same period last year. Net income was $13.5 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2007, compared to net income of $13.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
"As we previously announced, a general softness in the macro-economic environment impacted our sales throughout the second quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While we increased our promotional activity slightly and generated positive same store sales in May and June, those increases were not enough to offset weakness earlier in the quarter. From a product standpoint, our hardgoods category comped slightly positive during the second quarter, our footwear category was slightly down and apparel was our softest category, comping down in the low single digits.
"The start of the third quarter continues to be affected by the challenging consumer environment as well as soft sales comparisons of product categories that perform best in warmer weather due largely to significantly cooler weather than last year in many of our west coast markets," continued Mr. Miller. "We are cautiously optimistic about our opportunities for the remainder of the quarter. We have a strong promotional plan and believe we are well-positioned from a product offering and inventory perspective, and we are encouraged by the strength we are seeing in a number of product categories not impacted by the cooler temperatures. We remain confident in the effectiveness of our overall business model and continue to look for ways to enhance our top and bottom line performance in the current environment."
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 14, 2007 to stockholders of record as of August 31, 2007.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
During the 2007 second fiscal quarter and third fiscal quarter through July 31, 2007, the Company repurchased 215,100 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $5.0 million. Since the inception of the Company's share repurchase program, which had an initial authorization of $15.0 million, the Company has repurchased a total of 280,110 shares, for a total expenditure of $6.3 million.
Share Repurchases
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit negative to low single-digit positive range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.35. Third quarter guidance assumes that sales will continue to be challenged by macro-economic issues affecting the consumer environment and, compared to the prior year, reflects higher administrative expenses to support the Company's overall growth and financial reporting initiatives. For the fiscal 2007 full year, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit negative to low single-digit positive range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.22 to $1.42. Full year guidance assumes that sales will continue to be challenged by macro-economic issues affecting the consumer environment and, compared to the prior year, reflects lower distribution center expenses offset by a reduction in inventory cost capitalization and higher administrative expenses to support the Company's overall growth and financial reporting initiatives.
Guidance
During the fiscal 2007 second quarter, the Company opened four new stores, including a relocation of a store that the Company had closed during the first quarter, bringing its total store count as of the end of the second quarter to 348 stores. The Company anticipates opening five new stores, including one relocation, during the fiscal 2007 third quarter. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2007.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 1, 2007  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 third quarter ended September 30, 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 third quarter, net sales increased $8.0 million, or 3.6%, to $231.3 million from net sales of $223.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales increased 0.1% for the third quarter.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2007 third quarter increased to $82.0 million from $77.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin increased to 35.5% in the fiscal 2007 third quarter from 34.8% in the third quarter of the prior year. The gross margin improvement was driven by an increase of approximately 30 basis points in product margins and a $1.0 million decrease in distribution center costs resulting from operational efficiencies realized in the Company's new distribution center.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.8% in the fiscal 2007 third quarter compared to 26.4% in the third quarter of last year.
Net income for the fiscal 2007 third quarter was $8.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, versus net income of $7.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
"Our third quarter performance exceeded the upper end of our earnings guidance and demonstrated the strength of our business model," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While we continued to face a challenging consumer environment throughout the quarter, with particular headwinds in certain of our markets, our team did a tremendous job of overcoming these challenges and producing solid gains in the bottom line. Our same store sales comped positively and we meaningfully increased product margins during the quarter, while realizing significant distribution center savings from improved operating efficiencies."
Mr. Miller continued, "As we enter the fourth quarter, macro-economic conditions remain challenging and we expect a continuation of this environment for the remainder of the year. However, we believe we have a strong merchandising and promotional plan in place to drive business through the important holiday season."
For the thirty-nine week period ended September 30, 2007, net sales increased $23.9 million, or 3.7%, to $666.2 million from net sales of $642.3 million in the same period last year. Same store sales increased 0.2% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007 versus the same period last year. Net income was $21.9 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007, compared to net income of $21.2 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 14, 2007 to stockholders of record as of November 30, 2007.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
During the 2007 third fiscal quarter and fourth fiscal quarter through October 31, 2007, the Company repurchased 586,425 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $12.2 million. Since the inception of the Company's share repurchase program, which had an initial authorization of $15.0 million, the Company has repurchased a total of 666,535 shares, for a total expenditure of $13.9 million. The Company has $1.1 million of authorization remaining under this program.
Share Repurchases and New Repurchase Program
The Company's Board of Directors also has authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $20.0 million of the Company's common stock. Under the authorization, the Company may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the timing and amount of such purchases, if any, would be at the discretion of management, and would depend on market conditions and other considerations.
 
"Our business model continues to generate significant free cash flow, and we have used that cash flow, together with borrowings under our credit facility, to deliver value to our stockholders by paying our quarterly dividend and repurchasing our stock," said Mr. Miller. "We are pleased to announce the authorization of a new repurchase program today, as we believe the program confirms and strengthens our commitment to enhancing stockholder value over the long term."
For the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit negative to low single-digit positive range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.36 to $0.46. For the fiscal 2007 full year, the Company expects to realize same store sales growth in the low single-digit negative to low single-digit positive range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.33 to $1.43. Fourth quarter and full-year guidance assumes that sales will continue to be challenged by macro-economic issues affecting the consumer environment, and full-year guidance compared to the prior year reflects lower distribution center expenses offset by a reduction in inventory cost capitalization and higher administrative expenses to support the Company's overall growth and financial reporting initiatives.
Guidance
During the fiscal 2007 third quarter, the Company opened six new stores, including one relocation, bringing its total store count as of the end of the third quarter to 353 stores. The Company has opened three new stores during the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter to date. The Company anticipates opening seven additional stores before the end of the year, for a total of 20 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2007.
Store Openings

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., January 10, 2008  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results and updated earnings guidance for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, net sales were $232.1 million versus $234.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales declined 4.7% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales were impacted by a decline in customer traffic year-over-year, as macro-economic issues continued to affect the consumer sales environment. Additionally, sales results were impacted by a significant deterioration in the performance of the roller shoe product category over the prior year, which accounted for approximately 45% of the same store sales decline.
For the fiscal 2007 full year, net sales increased $21.5 million, or 2.5%, to $898.3 million from $876.8 million for the fiscal 2006 full year. Same store sales declined 1.0% for the full year 2007.
For the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.28. For the fiscal 2007 full year, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.22 to $1.25. Previously issued guidance for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year should not be relied upon.
"We are disappointed to report fourth quarter sales below our plan," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although we had been able to manage through the difficult business conditions in many of our markets during the first nine months of the year, the consumer environment during the holiday selling season was even more challenging than we had anticipated. We continue to examine and augment areas of our business that we can influence, including enhancing our merchandise offering and promotional plan, as well as controlling expenses. We remain confident in the effectiveness of our overall business model that produced 45 consecutive quarters of
 
positive same store sales growth through the first quarter of 2007, and we look forward to stronger results as the consumer spending environment improves."
The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide guidance for fiscal 2008, by the first week of March.
The Company will provide comments regarding its sales results and updated guidance on a pre-recorded conference call, which will be available for 8 days beginning at 7:00 a.m. EST on Thursday, January 10, 2008.

ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., February 28, 2008  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2007.
As the Company previously reported, for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, net sales were $232.1 million, compared to net sales of $234.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales declined 4.7% for the fourth quarter. The decrease in sales is primarily attributable to weakened customer traffic as a result of the challenging consumer environment. Additionally, sales results were impacted by a significant deterioration in the performance of the roller shoe product category over the prior year, which accounted for approximately 45% of the same store sales decline.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter was $79.2 million, compared to $80.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 34.1% in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter versus 34.3% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The slight decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by a 35 basis point decline in product selling margins and higher store occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in distribution center expenses resulting from operational efficiencies realized in the Company's new distribution center.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 28.8% in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter versus 26.6% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the lower than anticipated sales levels, higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count and higher advertising expenses resulting in part from the timing of co-op advertising programs.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $6.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
For the fiscal 2007 full year ended December 30, 2007, net sales increased $21.5 million, or 2.5%, to $898.3 million from net sales of $876.8 million for fiscal 2006. Same store sales decreased 1.0% in the fiscal 2007 full year versus the prior year. Net income was $28.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2007 full year, compared to net income of $30.8 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2006 full year.
"Our fourth quarter and full-year earnings are in line with our revised guidance and reflect the continued challenging macro-economic environment," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Like many other retailers, we experienced weak consumer spending during the holiday selling season. This softness in the retail environment has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Although weather conditions have benefited sales of winter-related products, we have not experienced strength in many of our other product categories. Additionally, we expect product selling margins to be impacted in the first quarter, given continued weakness in the roller shoe product category, inflationary pressures and the fact that we have been slightly more aggressive in our promotional pricing efforts to drive sales and reduce inventory in this difficult environment.
Mr. Miller continued, "We remain confident in the effectiveness of our overall business model and continue to focus on long-term strategies, including augmenting areas of our business that we can influence, such as opportunistically buying merchandise, enhancing our merchandise offering and promotional plan, securing new store locations and controlling expenses. We believe these efforts will strengthen our market position and enable us to achieve higher levels of earnings when the consumer spending environment improves."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on March 14, 2008 to stockholders of record as of February 29, 2008.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 first quarter through February 27, 2008, the Company repurchased 216,551 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $3.3 million. In making these repurchases, the Company utilized the remaining availability under its initial $15.0 million share repurchase program and approximately $1.7 million of the $20.0 million available under the share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. Since the inception of the Company's initial share repurchase program in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company has repurchased a total of 858,086 shares, for a total expenditure of $16.7 million.
 
Guidance
The Company's guidance for the fiscal 2008 first quarter and full year assumes that sales will continue to be impacted by a challenging consumer environment throughout the year. Based on that assumption, the Company is providing the following guidance:
A material improvement or decline in the overall consumer environment during the year could materially impact the Company's performance relative to this guidance.
Store Openings
The Company opened ten new stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, bringing its store count at the end of fiscal 2007 to 363 stores, from 343 at the end of fiscal 2006. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations and closures, during fiscal 2008.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year.

ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., April 30, 2008  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2008 first quarter ended March 30, 2008.
For the fiscal 2008 first quarter, net sales were $212.9 million, compared to net sales of $217.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Same store sales declined 5.1% for the first quarter. Sales results reflect weakness in the consumer environment, which contributed to a decrease in customer traffic, as well as the continued deterioration in the performance of the roller shoe product category over the prior year, partially offset by strong sales of winter-related products due to favorable weather conditions in many of the Company's markets. The decline in roller shoe performance accounted for approximately 40% of the same store sales decline during the first quarter. Additionally, sales results were negatively impacted by the shift of the Easter holiday, when the Company's stores were closed, from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2008 first quarter was $71.6 million, compared to $75.8 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.6% in the fiscal 2008 first quarter versus 34.9% in the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by an 83 basis-point decline in product selling margins and higher store occupancy costs. Product selling margins were impacted primarily by higher sales of winter-related products at lower margins versus the prior year, lower sales and margins in roller shoes and slightly more aggressive promotional pricing in an effort to drive sales and reduce merchandise inventory.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 29.7% in the fiscal 2008 first quarter versus 28.4% in the first quarter of the prior year, primarily due to lower sales levels and higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $4.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
"Despite a strong first quarter performance by our winter-related product categories, which benefited in part from favorable weather conditions in many of our markets, we were unable to fully offset the general softness in the overall consumer environment and the substantial impact of very negative sales comparisons in our roller shoe category," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Given the difficult consumer climate, we have worked very hard to strengthen the aspects of our business that are within our control, including our inventory position. We improved our total inventory comparisons versus the prior year by approximately $24 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008. These efforts resulted in our inventories being down 5.3% on a per-store basis at the end of the first quarter this year compared to the end of the first quarter last year."
Mr. Miller continued, "Although first quarter results were in line with our expectations, the continuing softness in the consumer environment and the resulting unpredictability of customer traffic and sales make our ability to forecast the remainder of the year challenging. Based on this uncertain economic environment and recent sales trends, we are maintaining a cautious outlook. While the retail environment has remained weak during the second quarter, we believe that our continued focus on improving the execution of our overall business model, including refining our merchandise mix and promotional plans, securing quality new store locations and controlling expenses, will position us well when the consumer climate improves."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 13, 2008 to stockholders of record as of May 30, 2008. Based on the current price of the Company's stock, this dividend equates to an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4%.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2008 first quarter, the Company repurchased 279,768 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $2.8 million. The Company has $16.7 million available under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
 
Guidance
The Company's guidance for the fiscal 2008 second quarter and full year assumes that sales will continue to be impacted by a challenging consumer environment throughout the year. Based on that assumption, the Company is providing the following guidance:
A material improvement or decline in the overall consumer environment during the remainder of the year could materially impact the Company's performance relative to this guidance.
Store Openings
The Company opened one new store during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company operated 364 stores at the end of the first quarter and anticipates opening three net new stores during the fiscal 2008 second quarter. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations and closures, during fiscal 2008.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., July 31, 2008  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2008 second quarter ended June 29, 2008.
For the fiscal 2008 second quarter, net sales were $209.0 million, compared to net sales of $217.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Same store sales declined 7.6% for the second quarter, primarily due to a mid-single digit decrease in customer traffic and continued weakness in the roller shoe product category, which accounted for approximately 140 basis points of the same store sales decline during the second quarter.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2008 second quarter was $68.4 million, compared to $74.8 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.7% in the fiscal 2008 second quarter versus 34.3% in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company achieved an 11 basis-point increase in product selling margins and lowered overall distribution center expenses versus the prior year despite operating 22 more stores and experiencing increased freight costs due to higher fuel prices. These benefits were offset by higher store occupancy costs and a $1.5 million one-time pre-tax charge to correct an error in the Company's previously recognized straight-line rent expense, substantially all of which pertained to prior periods and accumulated over a period of 15 years. This charge accounted for approximately 75 basis points of the decline in gross profit margin during the second quarter.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.8% in the fiscal 2008 second quarter versus 29.1% in the second quarter of the prior year, primarily due to lower sales levels and higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
For the 26 week period ended June 29, 2008, net sales decreased $13.0 million, or 3.0%, to $421.9 million from net sales of $434.9 million for the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 6.4% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008 versus the same period last year. Net income was $5.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008, compared to net income of $13.5 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
Results for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008 include a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, to correct an error in the Company's previously recognized straight-line rent expense, substantially all of which pertained to prior periods and accumulated over a period of 15 years. The Company has determined this charge to be immaterial to its prior year and current year financial statements.
"Given the challenging sales environment, we are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which came in at the high end of our expectations on an operational basis, but were impacted by the one-time charge relating to lease accounting," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved meaningful savings ahead of our plan in several major expense areas of our business, including store-level, distribution center, advertising and corporate administrative expense. We continued with our strong inventory management and completed the second quarter with chain-wide product inventories down from the prior year while operating 22 additional stores. On a per-store basis, product inventories were down 6.3% versus the prior year. We have further improved inventory comparisons during the third quarter to date."
Mr. Miller continued, "We believe that we have a solid grasp on the controllable aspects of our business in the current environment and remain committed to our overall business model, including securing quality new store locations, refining our merchandise mix and promotional plans, managing inventory and controlling expenses."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 15, 2008 to stockholders of record as of August 29, 2008. Based on the current price of the Company's stock, this dividend equates to an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4%.
 
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2008 second quarter, the Company repurchased 210,474 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $1.7 million. As of the end of the fiscal 2008 second quarter, the Company had approximately $15.0 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
The Company's guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2008 assumes that sales will continue to be impacted by a challenging consumer environment. Based on that assumption, the Company is providing the following guidance:
A material improvement or decline in the overall consumer environment during the remainder of the year could materially impact the Company's performance relative to this guidance.
Store Openings
The Company opened six new stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, including one relocation of a store that was closed after the end of the quarter. The Company ended the second quarter with 370 stores in operation. The Company anticipates opening four new stores during the fiscal 2008 third quarter, and has closed the store that was relocated during the second quarter. The Company anticipates opening approximately 20 new stores, net of relocations and closures, during fiscal 2008.

Historically, the Company has presented total depreciation and amortization expense separately on the face of the interim unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and corporate headquarters' occupancy costs within cost of sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2007, the Company retrospectively changed the classification of distribution center and store occupancy depreciation and amortization expense to cost of sales and store equipment and corporate headquarters' depreciation and amortization expense to selling and administrative expense. Depreciation and amortization expense is no longer presented separately in the interim unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. The corporate headquarters' occupancy costs are now included in selling and administrative expense. The Company reclassified its prior period interim unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and related discussion and analysis to conform to the new presentation, which increased cost of sales and decreased gross profit for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended July 1, 2007, by $2.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and increased selling and administrative expense for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended July 1, 2007, by $1.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively, from amounts previously reported. This reclassification had no effect on the Company's previously reported operating or net income, interim unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and interim unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, and is not considered material to any previously reported consolidated financial statements.
(1)
In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $1.5 million to correct an error in its previously recognized straight-line rent expense, substantially all of which related to prior periods and accumulated over a period of 15 years. This charge reduced net income by $0.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The Company determined this charge to be immaterial to its prior periods' and current year consolidated financial statements.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 3, 2008  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2008 third quarter ended September 28, 2008.
For the fiscal 2008 third quarter, net sales were $223.2 million, compared to net sales of $231.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Same store sales declined 6.6% for the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic resulting from the continuation of the challenging consumer environment.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2008 third quarter was $74.3 million, compared to $79.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.3% in the fiscal 2008 third quarter versus 34.3% in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company achieved an 11 basis-point increase in product selling margins and lowered overall distribution center expenses versus the prior year despite operating 19 more stores and experiencing increased freight costs due to higher fuel prices. These benefits were offset by higher store occupancy costs due primarily to an increased store count.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 29.6% in the fiscal 2008 third quarter versus 27.7% in the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to lower sales levels and higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $4.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
 
For the 39-week period ended September 28, 2008, net sales decreased $21.2 million, or 3.2%, to $645.0 million, from net sales of $666.2 million for the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 6.5% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2008 versus the same period last year. Net income was $10.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2008, compared to net income of $21.9 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Results for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2008 include a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the second quarter to correct an error in the Company's straight-line rent expense, substantially all of which pertained to prior periods.
"We are pleased with the relative strength of our performance in this challenging consumer environment, as we delivered third quarter earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "By focusing on managing our inventory and controlling expenses, we continued to mitigate the impact of the difficult macro-economic environment on our sales. We achieved increased efficiencies in our distribution center and reduced total product inventories by 4.9% from the prior year despite operating 19 more stores."
Mr. Miller continued, "While recent events have demonstrated that economic conditions are difficult to forecast and consumer spending is likely to remain soft through the holiday season, we believe that we are well positioned from an operational, promotional and product offering perspective. We are taking the steps that we believe are necessary to weather the current economic turbulence, while continuing to offer a strong value proposition that we believe will resonate with consumers as they evaluate their spending power in today's economy."
Quarterly Cash Dividend

On December 31, 2008, the Registrant and its wholly owned subsidiary, Big 5 Corp., executed a Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Second Amended Agreement") with Steven G. Miller, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. The Second Amended Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between the Registrant, Big 5 Corp. and Steven G. Miller dated June 14, 2002 (the "Prior Agreement"). The principal purpose of the Second Amended Agreement was to amend the Prior Agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations and guidance. In general, the changes reflected in the Second Amended Agreement relate to the timing of payments to Mr. Miller under his employment agreement following certain events. The Second Amended Agreement also updates various other provisions, including to conform Mr. Miller's base salary to his current base salary. The Second Amended Agreement does not materially affect the scope or amounts of compensation or benefits that Mr. Miller is entitled to receive under his agreement.
Section 409A changed the income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation and imposed new requirements on both the terms and operation of such compensation. Although the provisions of Section 409A have been in effect since 2005, and employers have been required to operate in good faith since that time, final regulations under Section 409A were not issued until 2007. Companies must amend affected nonqualified deferred compensation plans by December 31, 2008, to ensure that they comply with Section 409A and the Section 409A final regulations. Under the final Section 409A regulations, certain severance payments under the Prior Agreement can constitute deferred compensation
A copy of the Second Amended Agreement is attached hereto as an exhibit.

None of the foregoing events, however, shall constitute a Change of Control if such event is not a "Change in Control Event" under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) or successor IRS guidance.

Accounting Firm
 
The Accounting Firm shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, both to the Company and to Executive before payment of Executive's severance payment under Section 6 (if requested at that time by the Company or Executive) or such other time as requested by the Company or Executive (in either case provided that the Company or Executive believes in good faith that any of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). Within ten (10) calendar days of the delivery of the Determination to Executive, Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination. The existence of any dispute shall not in any way affect Executive's right to receive the Payments in accordance with the Determination. If there is no Dispute, the Determination by the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive, subject to the application of Section 6.3(c).
               (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is possible that the Payments either will have been made or will not have been made by the Company, in either case in a manner inconsistent with the limitations provided in Section 6.3(a) (an "" or "", respectively). If it is established pursuant to (i) a final determination of a court for which all appeals have been taken and finally resolved or the time for all appeals has expired or (ii) an Internal Revenue Service (the "") proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved, that an Excess Payment has been made, such Excess Payment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a loan to Executive made on the date Executive received the Excess Payment and Executive shall repay the Excess Payment to the Company on demand, together with interest on the Excess Payment at one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable federal rate compounded semi-annually from the date of Executive's receipt of such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment. If it is determined (i) by the Accounting Firm, the Company or the IRS, (ii) pursuant to a determination by a court, or (iii) upon the resolution to Executive's satisfaction of the dispute, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount equal to the Underpayment to Executive within ten (10) calendar days of such determination or resolution, together with interest on such amount at one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable federal rate compounded semi-annually from the date such amount should have been paid to Executive pursuant to the terms of this Second Amended Agreement or otherwise, but for the operation of this Section 6.3(c), until the date of payment.

          7.2 .
Nondisclosure of Confidential Material
               (a) In the performance of his duties, Executive has previously had, and may be expected in the future to have, access to confidential records and information, including, but not limited to, development, marketing, purchasing, organizational, strategic, financial, managerial, administrative, manufacturing, production, distribution and sales information, data, specifications and processes presently owned or at any time hereafter developed by the Company or its agents or consultants or used presently or at any time hereafter in the course of its business, that are not otherwise part of the public domain (collectively, the ""). All such Confidential Material is considered secret and has been and/or will be disclosed to Executive in confidence. Except in the performance of his duties to the Company, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly for any reason whatsoever, disclose or use any such Confidential Material, except that the foregoing disclosure prohibition shall not apply as to Confidential Material that has been publicly disclosed (not due to a breach by Executive of his obligations hereunder or by breach of any other person of a confidential, fiduciary or confidential obligation, the breach of which Executive knows or reasonably should know). All records, files, drawings, documents, equipment and other tangible items, wherever located, relating in any way to the Confidential Material or otherwise to the Company's business, which Executive has prepared, used or encountered or shall in the future prepare, use or encounter, shall be and remain the Company's sole and exclusive property and shall be included in the Confidential Material. Upon termination of this Second Amended Agreement, or whenever requested by the Company, Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company any and all of the Confidential Material and copies thereof, not previously delivered to the Company, that may be, or at any previous time has been, in the possession or under the control of Executive.
Confidential Material
               (b) In light of the fact that the Confidential Material that Executive has acquired, and will acquire, is inextricably bound with Executive's knowledge regarding the conduct of the Company's business activities and that therefore Executive would necessarily use Confidential Material if he were to compete with the Company, Executive further agrees that during the term of Executive's employment relationship with the Company, he will not provide any services, whether as an officer, director, proprietor, employee, partner, consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or otherwise, nor will he own beneficially securities of any entity (except that, in the case of any entity whose equity securities are publicly-held, he may beneficially own up to 2% of the outstanding equity securities of such entity) that, directly or indirectly, competes with any of the Company's present or future (up to the date of termination) business activities. Executive further agrees that, upon the termination of the employment relationship between the Company and Executive for any reason, whether upon the expiration of the Term or earlier (including a voluntary termination by Executive), the restrictions set forth in the previous sentence shall extend for the greater of (x) a six-month period after termination and (y) the remainder of the Term as then in effect (without any further extensions thereof) but for such termination; , that the agreement between Executive and the Company contained in the first part of this sentence shall not apply in the event that Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Just Cause pursuant to Section 5.3, by Executive for

Good Reason pursuant to Section 5.3 or by the Company or Executive due to Executive's Unavailability pursuant to Section 5.4.
          7.3 . Executive acknowledges that violation of either Section 7.1 or 7.2 would cause the Company irreparable damage for which the Company cannot be reasonably compensated in damages in an action at law, and therefore in the event of any breach by Executive of Section 7.1 or 7.2, the Company shall be entitled to make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise (without being required to post a bond). This provision shall not, however, be construed as a waiver of any of the rights which the Company may have for damages under this Second Amended Agreement or otherwise, and all of the Company's rights and remedies shall be unrestricted.
Equitable Relief
     8. .
Arbitration as the Exclusive Remedy
          8.1 . If Executive and the Company cannot resolve a dispute (whether arising in contract or tort or any other legal theory and whether based on federal, state or local statute or common law and regardless of the identities of any other defendants) that in any way relates to or arises out of the employment relationship established herein or the termination thereof (a ""), then arbitration will be used to settle such Dispute. Because arbitration is generally faster and less expensive than other procedures for resolving disputes, both Executive and the Company agree that the arbitration procedure set forth below will be their exclusive remedy and waive any right to seek legal relief in any other form. In the event that a Dispute involves a claim which either Executive or the Company seeks to assert against a third party, the assertion of such claim against such third party in a court or other tribunal shall not relieve Executive and the Company from their respective obligations to resolve the Dispute between them by arbitration under Section 8. The parties further agree that arbitration shall be their exclusive remedy in the event of any Dispute which involves any third party (including any officer, director or agent of the Company or an affiliate of the Company) provided that such third party consents to participate in and be bound by such arbitration. The only exception to the preceding provisions of Section 8.1 is that the Company may seek provisional relief from any court having jurisdiction in the event of an alleged breach by Executive of Sections 7.1 or 7.2 or any other provision of this Second Amended Agreement pending a final determination by arbitration, in the event of any claim that would be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief and Executive may seek such provisional relief, pending a final determination by arbitration, in the event of any claim that would be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the employment arbitration procedures of the American Arbitration Association (""), except as modified in this Second Amended Agreement.

Each party shall have the right to designate one arbitrator within ten (10) business days from the date when the party initiating the arbitration files and delivers a notice of intent to arbitrate. If, within that time period, either party has failed to appoint an arbitrator, AAA shall make the appointment. The two arbitrators shall agree upon and designate a third arbitrator within ten (10) business days from the date of the appointment of the last-appointed arbitrator. In the event that the two arbitrators have not designated a third arbitrator within ten (10) business days from the date
Selection of Arbitrators
 
of the appointment of the last-appointed arbitrator, AAA shall appoint the third arbitrator. After the selection of arbitrators, the parties may mutually agree to use the third arbitrator as the sole arbitrator to resolve their dispute.
          8.3 . The party filing a claim must present it in writing to both the other party and the AAA office in Los Angeles within six months of the date the party filing the claim knew or should have known of it or the Termination Date, whichever is earlier. Any claim not brought within the required time period will be waived forever. In the arbitration proceedings (i) all testimony of witnesses shall be taken under oath, (ii) it is specifically contemplated and agreed by the parties hereto that the provisions of Section 1283.05 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as presently in force, be incorporated into and made a part of, and be applicable to, the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 8.3, and (iii) upon conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrators shall render findings of fact and conclusions of law in a written opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached and deliver such documents to each party to this Second Amended Agreement along with a signed copy of the award in accordance with Section 1283.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
Procedures
               Each party hereby agrees that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in preparation for and as a result of any such arbitration, including without limitation, filing fees, attorneys' fees, the compensation to be paid to the arbitrators in any such arbitration and costs of transcripts. The arbitrators shall not have power or competence to allocate between the parties in their award any such costs, expenses, fees or share of the arbitrators' compensation, except as provided in the preceding sentence.

Miscellaneous
          9.1 In the event that any compensation with respect to Executive's separation from service is "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder ("Section 409A"), the stock of the Company, Big 5 Corp., or any affiliate is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise, and Executive is determined to be a "specified employee," as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, payment of such compensation shall be delayed as required by Section 409A. Such delay shall last six months from the date of Executive's separation from service, except in the event of Executive's death. Within 30 days following the end of such six-month period, or, if earlier, Executive's death, the Company will make a catch-up payment to Executive equal to the total amount of such payments that would have been made during the six-month period but for this Section 9.1. The catch-up payment amount shall accrue simple interest at the prime rate of interest as published by the Bank of America as of the beginning of the deferral period, which such interest shall be paid with the catch-up payment. The Company will place an amount in a "rabbi trust" with an independent trustee reasonably acceptable to Executive equal to the catch-up payment plus the interest that will accrue thereon. Payments of compensation or benefits on Executive's termination of employment (other than accrued salary and vacation pay, other accrued amounts that must be paid under applicable law, and "welfare benefits" specified in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(a)(5)) shall be paid only if and when the termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h).

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., January 8, 2009  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and full year ended December 28, 2008.
For the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, net sales were $219.6 million, compared to net sales of $232.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Same store sales declined 8.6% for the fourth quarter due to a decrease in customer traffic resulting from the continuation of the challenging consumer environment. As anticipated, the Company's product selling margins were lower than the prior year, declining 50 basis points during the fourth quarter.
For the fiscal 2008 full year, net sales decreased $33.6 million, or 3.7%, to $864.7 million from $898.3 million for the fiscal 2007 full year. Same store sales declined 7.0% for the fiscal 2008 full year.
For the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.13 to $0.16, which is toward the upper end of previously issued earnings guidance. For the fiscal 2008 full year, the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.61 to $0.64.
"Given the unprecedented challenges that we and most retailers faced over the holiday season, we are pleased to report sales in line with, and anticipated earnings toward the upper end of, our previously issued guidance," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman,
 
President and Chief Executive Officer. "Importantly, we produced our fourth quarter sales without significantly compromising product margins. We believe our ability to deliver these results in this environment reflects the strength of our business model and reputation for offering values on quality merchandise, which has been a hallmark of our success for over 50 years. During the quarter, our three major merchandise categories performed within a relatively tight range of one another, with hard goods being our strongest category, followed by footwear and apparel."
Mr. Miller continued, "As would be expected, we have remained focused on controlling expenses and managing inventories. We reduced per-store inventories at year-end by approximately 11% from the prior year. We further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter, as our positive cash flow allowed us to reduce borrowings under our credit facility to $96.5 million at year-end from $103.4 million at the end of last year. We continue to take the steps that we believe are necessary to position our business for growth when the consumer climate improves."
The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide guidance for fiscal 2009, by the last week of February.

ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., February 26, 2009  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and full year ended December 28, 2008.
As the Company previously reported, for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, net sales were $219.6 million, compared to net sales of $232.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Same store sales declined 8.6% for the fourth quarter, due to a decrease in customer traffic as a result of the continuation of the challenging consumer environment.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter was $71.3 million, compared to $79.2 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.5% in the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter versus 34.1% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by a decline of approximately 50 basis points in product selling margins and deleveraging of store occupancy costs due to lower sales levels.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 29.3% in the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter versus 28.8% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily reflecting deleveraging of expenses as a result of lower sales volume. Overall selling and administrative expense declined $2.6 million during the quarter from the fourth quarter of the prior year, due to lower advertising, store-related and administrative expenses.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $3.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
For the fiscal 2008 full year ended December 28, 2008, net sales decreased $33.6 million, or 3.7%, to $864.7 million from net sales of $898.3 million for fiscal 2007. Same store sales decreased 7.0% in fiscal 2008 versus the prior year. Net income was $13.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for fiscal 2008, compared to net income of $28.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. Results for fiscal 2008 include a previously reported non-recurring pre-tax charge of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, recorded in the second quarter to correct an error in the Company's previously recognized straight-line rent expense, substantially all of which pertained to prior periods.
"In an increasingly difficult economic environment, we are pleased to report fourth quarter and full year earnings at the upper end of the guidance that we issued last November," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe these results reflect our operating discipline and ability to provide consumers with compelling values on quality products without significantly compromising our merchandise margins. During fiscal 2008 we focused on increasing operating efficiencies and managing our costs effectively as sales volume declined. As an example, through carefully managed attrition, we reduced our full-time company-wide headcount by approximately nine percent while operating 18 additional stores over the course of fiscal 2008 and continued to align our part-time store labor to sales levels."
Mr. Miller continued, "Recognizing that the economy is likely to remain challenging throughout 2009, we remain comfortable with our financial condition as we continue to take the steps we believe are necessary to effectively manage through this recessionary environment. We expect to further reduce our cost structure and manage our cash flow as business conditions warrant. We remain highly disciplined in our inventory management and are taking a conservative approach to new store growth. While we continue to explore opportunities for new locations, we expect to be very cautious in opening new stores until we have greater visibility of a broader economic turnaround."
Due to the nearly unprecedented downturn in the economy, the Company's Board of Directors has determined to reduce the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, for an annual rate of $0.20 per share. This decision is consistent with the Company's objective to utilize its capital to maintain a healthy financial condition during these challenging economic times. The quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock will be paid on March 20, 2009 to stockholders of record as of March 6, 2009.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
 
During the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 25,000 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $0.2 million. As of the end of fiscal 2008, the Company had approximately $14.2 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. Due to the current challenging economic environment, the Company currently expects to reduce or discontinue share repurchases in fiscal 2009.
Share Repurchases
Given the degree of uncertainty in the current economic environment, the Company will not at this time provide annual same store sales guidance or annual earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2009. The Company will currently provide forward quarter same store sales and earnings per share guidance.
Guidance
The Company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 assumes that sales will continue to be impacted by the challenging consumer environment. For the fiscal 2009 first quarter, the Company expects a decline in same store sales in the high-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.01 to $0.07. A material improvement or decline in the overall consumer environment could materially impact the Company's performance relative to this guidance.
The Company opened nine new stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, bringing its store count at the end of fiscal 2008 to 381 stores, from 363 stores at the end of fiscal 2007. The Company expects the number of new store openings in fiscal 2009 to be substantially lower than fiscal 2008 due to the continued challenging consumer environment.
Store Openings
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and full year. The webcast will be available at and archived for 30 days. Visitors to the website should select the "Investor Relations" link to access the webcast.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., April 30, 2009  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2009 first quarter ended March 29, 2009.
For the fiscal 2009 first quarter, net sales were $210.3 million, compared to net sales of $212.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Same store sales declined 4.4% for the first quarter. Sales results reflect continued weakness in the consumer environment, which contributed to a decrease in customer traffic during January and February. However, the Company experienced an improvement in customer traffic and sales results during March compared to the first two months of the quarter. As anticipated, first quarter sales comparisons to the prior year benefitted from a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the first quarter and into the second quarter in 2009.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2009 first quarter was $67.1 million, compared to $71.6 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 31.9% in the fiscal 2009 first quarter versus 33.6% in the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by higher store occupancy costs and a decline of approximately 88 basis points in merchandise margins due to a shift in the Company's product sales mix, slightly more promotional pricing and inflationary pressures.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 29.4% in the fiscal 2009 first quarter versus 29.7% in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company leveraged selling and administrative expense in the quarter by reducing expenses despite operating 17 more stores than the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense declined $1.4 million during the quarter from the same period last year due primarily to lower advertising and administrative expenses.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
"We are pleased with our first quarter performance in this challenging economic environment," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our operating results exceeded the upper end of our guidance range issued in late February, driven by significantly stronger than anticipated sales in March. We believe this improvement reflects the increasing attractiveness of our value proposition for consumers as well as the benefit of improved weather conditions later in the quarter. We continue to maintain tight control of our expenses and carefully manage our inventory and cash flow. Our inventory levels decreased 8% on a per-store basis during the first quarter compared to the prior year, while operating cash flow increased 33% to $26.6 million for the quarter. This allowed us to achieve a healthy $20 million reduction in our debt levels to approximately $77 million at quarter-end."
Mr. Miller continued, "The positive sales trends that we experienced in March have continued in the second quarter. Although we recognize that the overall consumer environment remains very challenging, we are encouraged by our recent sales performance and remain confident in our strategy to weather the current economic climate. We intend to continue to conservatively manage our business and focus on increasing market share by providing our customers with the compelling values that are the foundation of our business model."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2009 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2009.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2009 second quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the flat to positive low-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.18. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.08, including a non-recurring charge of $0.04 per diluted share.
 
Store Openings
During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company did not open any new stores or close any stores and continued to operate 381 stores. The Company anticipates opening one new store during the fiscal 2009 second quarter and continues to expect the number of new store openings in fiscal 2009 to be substantially lower than fiscal 2008.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., August 4, 2009  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2009 second quarter ended June 28, 2009.
For the fiscal 2009 second quarter, net sales were $216.0 million, compared to net sales of $209.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 0.3% for the second quarter, reflecting a reversal of the trend of same store sales declines for the past several quarters. As anticipated, second quarter sales comparisons to the prior year were negatively affected by a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the first quarter and into the second quarter in 2009.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2009 second quarter was $71.3 million, compared to $68.4 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.0% in the fiscal 2009 second quarter versus 32.7% in the second quarter of the prior year. The higher gross margin was primarily due to lower store occupancy costs as a result of a nonrecurring pre-tax charge of $1.5 million, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to correct an error in the Company's previously recognized straight-line rent expense. The year-over-year improvement was partially offset by a decline in merchandise margins of approximately 85 basis points due mainly to a shift in the Company's product sales mix and inflationary pressures.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 29.2% in the fiscal 2009 second quarter versus 30.8% in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company continued to leverage selling and administrative costs through higher sales and reduced expenses despite operating 18 more stores than the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense declined $1.4 million during the quarter from the same period last year due primarily to lower advertising expenses.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $4.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 include the nonrecurring pre-tax charge of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.
For the 26-week period ended June 28, 2009, net sales increased $4.4 million, or 1.1%, to $426.3 million from net sales of $421.9 million for the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 2.1% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 versus the same period last year. Net income was $7.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009, compared to net income of $5.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, including the nonrecurring charge of $0.04 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
"We are pleased to deliver an outstanding second quarter performance as we experienced an improvement in customer traffic, returned to positive same store sales and significantly increased our operating income from the prior year," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our positive results underscore the strength of our business model and ability to execute during these challenging economic times. We continue to maintain tight control of our expenses and conservatively manage our inventory and balance sheet. Our inventory levels were 6% lower on a per-store basis at the end of the second quarter compared to the prior year, and our operating cash flow increased 34% to $28.5 million for the first half of the year. As a result, we continued to reduce our debt levels, to $73 million at quarter end, which is a $31 million decrease compared to the end of the second quarter last year."
Mr. Miller continued, "We are encouraged that the positive trends in customer traffic and sales have continued into the third quarter. Customers are clearly recognizing and responding to the tremendous values that we provide on quality merchandise. While the timing of an economic recovery is uncertain, we believe that we are in a strong competitive and financial position to drive bottom line performance in today's consumer environment."
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 15, 2009 to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2009.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
 
For the fiscal 2009 third quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the flat to positive low-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.34. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.21.
Guidance
The Company opened one new store during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and ended the quarter with 382 stores. The Company does not plan to open any new stores during the fiscal 2009 third quarter, and anticipates opening approximately four new stores during the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Barry Emerson Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (310) 536-0611
ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 3, 2009  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2009 third quarter ended September 27, 2009.
For the fiscal 2009 third quarter, net sales increased to $231.6 million from net sales of $223.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. As the Company previously reported, same store sales increased 1.6% for the third quarter, representing the second consecutive quarter of same store sales growth despite a continued challenging consumer environment.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2009 third quarter was $78.5 million, compared to $74.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.9% in the fiscal 2009 third quarter versus 33.3% in the third quarter of the prior year. The improvement in gross profit margin was driven primarily by an increase in merchandise margins of 13 basis points and lower distribution costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 28.2% in the fiscal 2009 third quarter versus 29.6% in the third quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense declined $0.6 million for the quarter from the same period last year due primarily to lower advertising expense, partially offset by higher store-related expenses.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 improved to $8.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, from net income of $4.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
For the 39-week period ended September 27, 2009, net sales increased to $657.9 million from net sales of $645.0 million for the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 0.8% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2009 versus the same period last year. Net income improved by 49.7% to $15.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2009, from net income of $10.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Results for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2008 included a nonrecurring charge of $0.04 per diluted share recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
"We are pleased to deliver a solid third quarter top and bottom line performance, as our customer value proposition and proven business model continue to produce positive results," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The commitment and hard work of our dedicated associates have enabled us to successfully weather the difficult economic environment and improve many of our key financial metrics. We increased same store sales for the second consecutive quarter and grew net income by 80%. Through prudent inventory management, we lowered inventory levels on a per-store basis by approximately 8% at the end of the third quarter compared to the prior year and we generated operating cash flow of $47.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2009, a 61% increase from the same period last year. We also have continued to reduce debt levels, ending the third quarter with $60 million of long-term debt compared to $100 million at the end of the third quarter last year."
Mr. Miller continued, "We are encouraged that the positive sales trends we experienced during the third quarter have continued, and actually improved, thus far in the fourth quarter. For the first five weeks of the quarter, we have comped positively in the low single-digit range. While the critical holiday period is still ahead and consumer spending habits remain unpredictable, we are excited about our product assortment and promotional plans and believe that our ability to provide tremendous values on quality merchandise will position us well during the gift-giving season."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 15, 2009 to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2009.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low to low-mid single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.28 to $0.38. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.17. As a result of the fiscal calendar, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009
 
will include 14 weeks and the fourth quarter last year included 13 weeks. The Company's same store sales guidance above reflects comparable 14-week periods.
Store Openings
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company did not open any new stores or close any stores and continued to operate 382 stores. The Company anticipates opening two new stores during the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter. The Company expects the number of new store openings in fiscal 2010 to be substantially higher than fiscal 2009.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., January 12, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and full year ended January 3, 2010.
For the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, net sales were $237.6 million, compared to net sales of $219.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 0.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company's merchandise margins increased 88 basis points during the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
For the fiscal 2009 full year, net sales increased $30.8 million, or 3.6%, to $895.5 million from $864.7 million for the fiscal 2008 full year. Same store sales decreased 0.6% for the fiscal 2009 full year.
As a result of the fiscal year calendar, the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter included 14 weeks and the fiscal 2009 full year included 53 weeks, compared to 13 weeks and 52 weeks for the respective reporting periods in the prior year. For purposes of reporting same store sales comparisons to the prior year, the Company uses comparable 14-week and 53-week periods.
 
For the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.28 to $0.30, which is within the Company's previously issued guidance range and compares to earnings per diluted share in the prior year period of $0.17. Updated earnings guidance for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter includes a net nonrecurring pre-tax charge of approximately $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, which reflects the establishment of a reserve for a previously disclosed lawsuit, offset by the proceeds received from the settlement of a class action lawsuit relating to credit card fees.
For the fiscal 2009 full year, the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.00 to $1.02, which is an increase of over 50% compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.64 in the prior year. Updated earnings guidance for the fiscal 2009 full year includes the net nonrecurring pre-tax charge of approximately $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, relating to legal matters.
"We are pleased to deliver our third consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth together with a substantial earnings increase over the prior year," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although our fourth quarter sales were slightly softer than plan, our merchandise margins exceeded our expectations, increasing 88 basis points for the quarter. We experienced strength in our hard goods and footwear categories, which comped positively in the low single digit range for the quarter. The primary factor in our softer than expected sales was the performance of our winter product categories, which comped negatively in the high single digit range for the quarter as most of our markets experienced unfavorable winter weather comparisons to the prior year. This led to our apparel category, which is heavily influenced by the sale of winter products, being down mid-single digits for the quarter."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the fourth quarter, we continued to successfully manage expenses and inventories. We also further strengthened our balance sheet, as our positive cash flow allowed us to reduce borrowings under our credit facility by 43% to $55.0 million at year-end from $96.5 million at the end of last year."
The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide guidance for fiscal 2010, by the first week of March.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., March 2, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 3, 2010.
As the Company previously reported, for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, net sales were $237.6 million, compared to net sales of $219.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Same store sales for the 14-week period ended January 3, 2010 increased 0.1% versus the comparable period in the prior year.
As a result of the fiscal year calendar, the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter included 14 weeks and the fiscal 2009 full year included 53 weeks, compared to 13 weeks and 52 weeks for the respective reporting periods in the prior year. For purposes of reporting same store sales comparisons to the prior year, the Company uses comparable 14-week and 53-week periods.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter was $80.8 million, compared to $71.3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 34.0% in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter versus 32.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was driven primarily by an increase in merchandise margins of 89 basis points and lower distribution costs as a percentage of net sales.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 29.4% in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter versus 29.3% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The slight increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales from the fourth quarter of the prior year was due to recording a net pre-tax charge of $1.0 million, or $0.03 after tax per diluted share, which reflects the establishment of a legal settlement accrual offset by proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit relating to credit card fees.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $6.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 include the net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to legal matters.
For the fiscal 2009 full year ended January 3, 2010, net sales increased $30.8 million, or 3.6%, to $895.5 million from net sales of $864.7 million for fiscal 2008. Same store sales for the 53-week period in fiscal 2009 decreased 0.6% versus the comparable period in the prior year. Net income was $21.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009, compared to net income of $13.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. Results for fiscal 2009 include the net charge of $0.03 per diluted share relating to legal matters. Results for fiscal 2008 included a charge of $0.04 per diluted share related to lease accounting.
"We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, which reflect the strength of our unique business model and solid execution by our team," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Throughout our history, we have focused on providing consumers with compelling values on quality products and managing the business effectively and efficiently, a strategy which is particularly well-suited to the current economic environment. Our successful performance enabled us to deliver sales growth and significantly improved earnings over the course of fiscal 2009. For the full year, we posted a 57% increase in net income and generated operating cash flow of $54.1 million, a 37% increase from fiscal 2008. We also have continued to reduce debt levels, ending the year with $55 million of long-term debt compared to $96 million at the end of fiscal 2008."
Mr. Miller continued, "We have enjoyed positive sales trends during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to date, as we have benefitted from favorable weather conditions in many of our markets. While we are encouraged by the start of our current quarter, we recognize that the economy remains challenging and the uncertainty experienced in the consumer environment over the last few years has continued into 2010. We remain confident in our overall business approach, and plan to continue to focus on driving sales and managing expenses while strategically increasing our store growth during the year ahead."
 
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on March 22, 2010 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2010.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
For the fiscal 2010 first quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.17 to $0.23. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $0.13.
Guidance
The Company opened two new stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, bringing its store count at the end of fiscal 2009 to 384 stores, from 381 stores at the end of fiscal 2008. During the fiscal 2010 first quarter, the Company anticipates opening three new stores, including one relocation.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 6, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended April 4, 2010.
For the fiscal 2010 first quarter, net sales increased to $218.5 million from net sales of $210.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 2.4% versus the comparable period last year, representing the Company's fourth consecutive quarterly increase in same store sales. As anticipated, first quarter sales were negatively affected by a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, into the first quarter from the second quarter last year.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2010 first quarter increased to $71.6 million from $67.1 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin improved to 32.7% in the fiscal 2010 first quarter versus 31.9% in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was driven primarily by an increase in merchandise margins of approximately 15 basis points and increased sales leverage on distribution and store occupancy costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.8% in the fiscal 2010 first quarter versus 29.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company leveraged selling and administrative costs through higher sales. Overall selling and
 
administrative expense increased $1.2 million during the quarter from the same period last year due mainly to the increase in store count.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 improved to $5.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, from net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
"We are pleased to have significantly improved both our top and bottom lines during the first quarter of fiscal 2010," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved earnings per share at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by growth in customer traffic and average sale and expansion of merchandise and operating margins. Our same store sales growth of 2.4% represented our strongest quarterly same store growth since the fourth quarter of 2006, as favorable winter weather conditions in many of our markets led to sales increases across our three major merchandise categories of apparel, footwear and hardgoods. Additionally, our strong cash flow enabled us to continue to reduce debt levels, and we ended the quarter with $46 million in debt compared to $55 million at the end of 2009 and $77 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009."
Mr. Miller continued, "We believe we are well positioned to grow same store sales again during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. While the economic environment in our markets remains challenging, we remain confident in our overall strategy and believe our focus on providing compelling values to our customers will continue to serve our business well."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2010 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2010.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2010 second quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.24 to $0.30. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $0.22.
Store Openings
During the first quarter, the Company opened two new stores and relocated one store. The Company ended the fiscal 2010 first quarter with 386 stores, and anticipates opening between 10 and 15 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2010.

     On July 8, 2010, Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release in which the Company, among other things, reported its same store sales results and updated its earnings guidance for its fiscal 2010 second quarter. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., July 8, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today provided same store sales results and updated earnings guidance for the second quarter ended July 4, 2010.
For the fiscal 2010 second quarter, same store sales declined 0.5% versus the comparable period last year. As a reminder, the Company's same store sales increased 0.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
For the fiscal 2010 second quarter, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.20 to $0.23, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.22 for the second quarter last year.
"Our top-line results were slightly softer than we expected, which we attribute largely to the sluggish pace of the economic recovery across much of our geography as well as a lack of warm weather in many of our west coast markets," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "All three of our major merchandise categories  footwear, hardgoods and apparel  performed within a relatively tight range of one another. Although we comped positively in April and June and experienced encouraging sales trends over the recent Fourth of July holiday period, those sales were not enough to offset a challenging month of May that was impacted by lackluster sales of summer-related products."
Mr. Miller continued, "We continue to perform well on the operational side of our business, as we maintained product margins for the quarter, and remain pleased with our inventory management and expense control efforts. While the economic environment in our markets
 
is not ideal, we remain confident in our overall strategy and believe our focus on providing compelling values to our customers will continue to serve our business well."
All figures in this release remain subject to the completion of normal quarter-end accounting procedures, which could result in changes to these preliminary results.
Store Openings
During the second quarter, the Company opened two new stores, including one which is intended to replace an existing store that is expected to close at a later date. The Company ended the fiscal 2010 second quarter with 388 stores, and continues to anticipate opening between 10 and 15 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2010.
Conference Call Information
The Company expects to report its earnings results for the fiscal 2010 second quarter and conduct a conference call to discuss those results as well as provide guidance for the fiscal 2010 third quarter during the first week of August.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Barry Emerson Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (310) 536-0611
ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., August 5, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended July 4, 2010.
For the fiscal 2010 second quarter, net sales increased to $219.8 million from net sales of $216.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. As the Company previously reported, same store sales for the quarter decreased 0.5% versus the comparable period last year. As a reminder, the Company's same store sales increased 0.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2010 second quarter increased to $73.0 million from $71.3 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.2% in the fiscal 2010 second quarter versus 33.0% in the second quarter of the prior year. The improvement in gross profit margin reflected an increase in merchandise margins of approximately 10 basis points and the leveraging of distribution costs, partially offset by increased store occupancy costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 29.6% in the fiscal 2010 second quarter versus 29.2% in the second quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $2.0 million during the quarter from the same period last year due mainly to higher labor and operating costs to support an increase in store count.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $4.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
For the 26-week period ended July 4, 2010, net sales increased $12.0 million, or 2.8%, to $438.3 million from net sales of $426.3 million in the 26 weeks ended June 28, 2009. Same store sales increased 0.9% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2010 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $9.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2010, compared to net income of $7.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first half of last year.
"Our second quarter earnings are in line with the revised guidance we issued in early July," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As previously reported, the slight same store sales decline for the quarter reflected the sluggish pace of the economic recovery and unseasonably cool weather in many of our markets, particularly during the month of May. We are encouraged by the positive sales trends that we experienced during June and into the third quarter to date. While the economic environment in our markets remains challenging, we are pleased with our solid execution and believe that our focus on providing customers with compelling values on an exciting product assortment will continue to serve our business well."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 15, 2010 to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2010.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2010 third quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the flat to positive low-single digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.34. As a reminder, the Company is transitioning from a 53-week fiscal year in 2009 back to a 52-week fiscal year in 2010. This transition is expected to significantly impact fiscal third quarter net sales and earnings comparisons to the prior year because a high volume sales week, which included the Fourth of July holiday, has shifted out of the third fiscal quarter and a historically lower volume sales week will shift into the end of the third fiscal quarter for 2010. Consequently, fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings guidance reflects the Company's expectation that this calendar shift will impact quarterly net sales comparisons to the prior year by approximately $7.0 million and quarterly earnings per diluted share comparisons to the prior year by approximately $0.07. The effect of the calendar shift is not reflected in the Company's same store sales guidance for the third quarter because the Company reports same store sales on a comparable calendar day basis as opposed to a fiscal period basis. For comparative purposes, for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company's same store sales increased 1.6% and earnings per diluted share were $0.37.
 
Store Openings
During the second quarter, the Company opened two new stores, including one which is intended to replace an existing store that is expected to close at a later date. The Company ended the second quarter with 388 stores, and continues to anticipate opening between 10 and 15 new stores, net of relocations, during fiscal 2010.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today, August 5, 2010, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EDT) to discuss financial results for the fiscal 2010 second quarter.

Table of Contents
     On October 18, 2010, Big 5 Corp. (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Parent"), Big 5 Services Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Big 5 Services" and, together with the Company, the "Borrowers"), and the Parent (together with the Borrowers, the "Obligors"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with, among others, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and Swing Line Lender, and the other lenders party thereto.
     The Company borrowed $67.4 million under the Credit Agreement on October 18, 2010 and used the proceeds from such borrowing to, among other things, repay all of its outstanding indebtedness under its existing financing agreement with The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc., as agent for itself and other lenders party thereto, and terminate all commitments to lend and other obligations thereunder (other than obligations such as indemnification obligations, which by the terms of the financing agreement continue after the termination of the financing agreement), and all liens securing obligations thereunder were released.
     
Availability
     The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with an aggregate committed availability of up to $140 million, which amount may be increased at the option of the Company up to a maximum of $165 million. The Company may also request additional increases in aggregate availability, up to a maximum of $200 million, in which case the existing lenders under the Credit Agreement will have the option to increase their commitments to accommodate the requested increase. If such existing lenders do not exercise that option, the Company may (with the consent of Wells Fargo, not to be unreasonably withheld) seek other lenders willing to provide such commitments. The Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans.
     The Company may borrow under the Credit Facility from time to time, provided the amounts outstanding will not exceed the lesser of the then aggregate availability (as described above) and the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount being referred to as the "Loan Cap"). The "Borrowing Base" generally is comprised of the sum, at the time of calculation of (a) 90% of eligible credit card accounts receivable of the Borrowers; plus (b)(i) during the period of September 15 through December 15 of each year, the cost of eligible inventory of the Borrowers, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory); and (ii) at all other times, the cost of eligible inventory of the Borrowers, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory); plus (c) the lesser of (i) the cost of eligible in-transit inventory of the Borrowers, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible in-transit inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible in-transit inventory) of the Borrowers, or (ii) $10,000,000, minus (d) certain reserves established by Wells Fargo in its role as the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.
     
Interest and Letter of Credit Fees
     Generally, the Borrowers may designate specific borrowings under the Credit Facility as either base rate loans or LIBO rate loans, except that swing line loans may only be designated as base rate loans. In
Table of Contents
each case, the applicable interest rate will be a function of the daily average, over the preceding fiscal quarter, of the excess of the Loan Cap over amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility (such amount being referred to as the "Average Daily Excess Availability").
     Those loans designated as LIBO rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable LIBO rate plus an applicable margin as shown in the table below.
     Those loans designated as base rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable margin for base rate loans (as shown below) plus the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate, as in effect from time to time, plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), (b) the LIBO rate, as adjusted to account for statutory reserves, plus one percent (1.00%), or (c) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Wells Fargo as its "prime rate".
     The applicable margin shall be as set forth for Level II in the table below from October 18, 2010 through January 2, 2011. Thereafter, the applicable margin for all loans will be as set forth below as a function of Average Daily Excess Availability for the prior fiscal quarter.
     Letters of credit fees shall be payable on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each outstanding letter of credit at a rate per annum equal to (a) with respect to standby letters of credit, the applicable margin (as shown above) from time to time applicable to LIBO rate loans, and (b) with respect to documentary (commercial) letters of credit, the applicable margin (as shown above) from time to time applicable to LIBO rate loans less 0.50%. Such fees will be payable quarterly in arrears.
     If any amount payable under the Credit Facility is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter generally bear interest at a default rate equal to the interest rate otherwise applicable plus 2% per annum. So long as any other event of default exists, the lenders have the right to raise the applicable interest rate on all outstanding amounts to the above described default rate.
     
Maturity; Prepayment
     All amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will mature and become due on October 18, 2014.
     The Borrowers may prepay any amounts outstanding at any time, subject to payment of certain breakage and redeployment costs relating to LIBO rate loans. The commitments under the Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by the Borrowers at any time without premium or penalty.
Table of Contents
     If at any time the aggregate amount of the loans outstanding under the Credit Facility, together with letters of credit, exceeds the Loan Cap as of that date, then the Borrowers must immediately repay loans and, if necessary thereafter, cash collateralize letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
     
General
     The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Obligors to, among other things: (i) incur liens; (ii) incur additional indebtedness; (iii) transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) merge, consolidate or alter their line of business; (v) guarantee obligations; (vi) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase its stock; and (vii) make advances, loans or investments.
     In addition, if at any time the excess of the Loan Cap over amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility (the "Excess Availability") falls below 12.5% of the Loan Cap, the Borrowers must maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated monthly on a trailing twelve months basis, of not less than 1.0:1.0, until such time as Excess Availability has equaled or exceeded 12.5% of the Loan Cap at all times for sixty (60) consecutive calendar days.
     The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to pay when due principal amounts in respect of the Credit Facility; failure to pay any interest or other amounts under the Credit Facility for 5 days after becoming due; failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the Credit Agreement; failure to satisfy certain judgments against the Company; failure to pay when due (or any other default which does or may lead to the acceleration of) certain other material indebtedness in principal amount in excess of $5 million; and certain insolvency and bankruptcy events.
     Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a general lien and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Obligors, including accounts receivable, documents, equipment, general intangibles and inventory. The Parent has guaranteed the obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Facility.
     The terms of the Credit Agreement were established in an arms-length negotiation in which Wells Fargo acted as agent for the various lenders. There are no material relationships between the Agent and the other lenders under the Credit Agreement and the Parent or the Borrowers, other than that certain lenders under the Credit Agreement were lenders under the Borrowers' prior financing agreement and certain lenders or their affiliates now provide, and may in the future provide, cash management and other services to the Company. The Agent will receive customary fees in connection with its services as agent under the Credit Agreement.
     The above description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which the Company expects to file with its next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any information disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or the exhibits hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., October 19, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today announced it has entered into a new credit agreement, arranged by Wells Fargo Capital Finance, with Wells Fargo Bank, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Bank of America, as Documentation Agent, PNC Bank and Union Bank.
The new credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility with aggregate availability of up to $140 million, which amount may be increased at the option of the Company up to a maximum of $165 million. The Company may also request additional increases in aggregate availability, which the lenders have the option to provide, up to a maximum of $200 million. The credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. In each case, the availability will be subject to a borrowing base calculation under the agreement.
Loans under the new credit facility will bear interest based on LIBO rates or a specified base rate (generally Wells Fargo's prime rate), plus a margin that is determined based on the remaining availability under the credit line. The margin for LIBO rate loans ranges from 2.00% to 2.25%, and the margin for base rate loans ranges from 1.00% to 1.25%.
The Company used the proceeds from the initial borrowings under this new credit facility to repay in full all of its outstanding indebtedness under its prior financing agreement with The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. and a syndicate of other lenders.
"We are pleased with the terms of the new credit facility and believe they reflect the strength of our business model and strong cash flow," said Barry Emerson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. "We feel this facility, along with our healthy financial condition, will
 
provide our business with financial flexibility to support continued long-term growth. We are fortunate to have partnered in this effort with such a solid bank group, led by the experience and resources of Wells Fargo Capital Finance."
The initial termination date of the new credit facility is October 18, 2014. The Company will be filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will include additional details about the agreement.

ICR, Inc. John Mills Senior Managing Director (310) 954-1105
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 2, 2010  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2010 third quarter ended October 3, 2010.
For the fiscal 2010 third quarter, net sales increased to $231.8 million from net sales of $231.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 2.0% for the third quarter versus the comparable period last year. The net sales comparison to the prior year was negatively impacted by a calendar shift as the Company transitioned to a 52-week fiscal year in 2010 from a 53-week fiscal year in 2009. As a result, a high volume sales week, which included the Fourth of July holiday, shifted out of the third fiscal quarter into the second quarter and a lower volume sales week at the beginning of October shifted into the third fiscal quarter of 2010. The effect of the calendar shift is not reflected in the Company's third quarter same store sales comparison to the prior year because the Company reports same store sales on a comparable calendar day basis as opposed to a fiscal period basis.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2010 third quarter was $77.4 million, compared to $78.5 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.4% in the fiscal 2010 third quarter versus 33.9% in the third quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by a decrease in merchandise margins of approximately 50 basis points reflecting a shift in the Company's product sales mix, as well as higher store occupancy costs reflecting the expense for new store openings.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 28.6% in the fiscal 2010 third quarter versus 28.2% in the third quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $1.0 million for the quarter from the same period last year due primarily to higher store-related expenses as a result of new store openings.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $6.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, versus net income of $8.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
For the 39-week period ended October 3, 2010, net sales increased to $670.1 million from net sales of $657.9 million for the 39-week period last year. Same store sales increased 1.3% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2010 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $16.6 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2010, up from net income of $15.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
"The third quarter represented another solid financial performance for Big 5 Sporting Goods," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We produced positive same store sales over each month of the period, as we benefitted from increased customer traffic. These positive metrics were on top of the positive comps and increased traffic we reported for the same period last year. As anticipated, our sales and bottom line fiscal comparisons to the prior year were significantly impacted by the calendar shift that moved a high volume sales week out of the third quarter and a lower volume sales week into the third quarter."
Mr. Miller continued, "We are pleased with the consistency of our business as sales have continued to trend positively into the fourth quarter. While the important holiday selling season lies ahead and the economy and consumer spending habits remain unpredictable, we believe that our ability to provide exceptional value on quality merchandise will position us well as we conclude the year."
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 15, 2010 to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2010.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
For the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.33. As a result of the fiscal year calendar, the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter included 14 weeks and the fiscal fourth quarter this year includes 13 weeks. The Company's same store sales guidance reflects comparable 13-week periods.
Guidance
 
The Company opened three new stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, bringing its store count at the end of the quarter to 391 stores. The Company has opened two new stores during the fourth quarter to date, and anticipates opening an additional five new stores over the remainder of the fourth quarter. Three of the seven stores that are anticipated to open in the fourth quarter are part of relocations that are expected to result in existing stores closing in early 2011. For the fiscal 2010 full year, the Company currently anticipates opening 11 new stores, plus four relocations. Of the four relocations, one replaced store has closed and three existing stores are currently scheduled to close in early 2011.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., January 11, 2011  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2011.
For the 13-week fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, net sales were $226.7 million, compared to net sales of $237.6 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Same store sales decreased 0.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. After achieving same store sales growth in the low-to-mid single-digit range through the first two months of the quarter, which included the "Black Friday" weekend, sales trends turned negative during the shopping period before Christmas. During the quarter, the Company's apparel sales increased in the low single-digit range, footwear sales were relatively flat and hardgoods sales decreased in the low single-digit range, all on a same store basis compared to the same period last year. The Company's merchandise margins decreased 20 basis points for the fourth quarter from the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, the Company's merchandise margins improved 88 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2009 over the prior year period.
For the 52-week fiscal 2010 full year, net sales increased to $896.8 million from $895.5 million for the 53-week fiscal 2009 full year. Same store sales increased 0.8% for the fiscal 2010 full year.
As a result of the fiscal year calendar, the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter included 13 weeks and the fiscal 2010 full year included 52 weeks, compared to 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the respective reporting periods in fiscal 2009. For purposes of reporting same store sales comparisons to the prior year, the Company uses comparable 13-week and 52-week periods.
For the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.25, excluding a net charge of $0.07 per diluted share related to legal matters as discussed below, compared to a previously issued guidance range of $0.25 to $0.33. During the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, the Company's earnings per diluted share were $0.32, excluding a net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to legal matters. For the fiscal 2010 full year, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in
 
the range of $0.99 to $1.01, excluding the net charge of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to earnings per diluted share in the prior year of $1.04, excluding the net charge of $0.03 per diluted share.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $2.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share after tax, for lawsuits previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, of which $1.5 million will be classified as selling and administrative expense and $0.8 million will be classified as a reduction in net sales. Including this charge, the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter in the range of $0.16 to $0.18. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company's earnings per diluted share were $0.29, including a net pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share after tax. Including the legal charges in both periods, for the fiscal 2010 full year the Company expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.92 to $0.94 compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.01 in the prior year.
"We are disappointed that our sales results came in below expectations for the fourth quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved same store sales in the positive low-single-digit range for October and positive mid-single-digit range for November, which included the Black Friday' weekend. However, these gains were offset as our sales turned negative over the three-week key gift shopping period preceding Christmas. We are encouraged that positive sales trends resumed after Christmas and have continued into the start of 2011. We are also pleased to have further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter, as our positive cash flow allowed us to reduce borrowings under our credit facility by 12% to $48.3 million at year-end compared to the end of fiscal 2009."
The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, by the first week of March.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., March 1, 2011  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2011.
As the Company previously reported, net sales for the 13-week fiscal 2010 fourth quarter were $226.7 million, compared to net sales of $237.6 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Same store sales decreased 0.7% for the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the comparable period in the prior year.
As a result of the fiscal year calendar, the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter included 13 weeks and the fiscal 2010 full year included 52 weeks, compared to 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the respective reporting periods in fiscal 2009. For purposes of reporting same store sales comparisons to the prior year, the Company uses comparable 13-week and 52-week periods.
Gross profit for the 13-week fiscal 2010 fourth quarter was $75.8 million, compared to $80.8 million in the 14-week fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.4% in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter versus 34.0% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by lower merchandise margins of 20 basis points and higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales due largely to new store openings.
 
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.5% in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter versus 29.4% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $4.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 include a net pre-tax charge of $2.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for lawsuits previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, of which $1.5 million was classified as selling and administrative expense and $0.8 million was classified as a reduction in net sales. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 include a net pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to legal matters.
For the 52-week fiscal 2010 full year, net sales increased to $896.8 million from net sales of $895.5 million for the 53-week fiscal 2009 full year. Same store sales in fiscal 2010 increased 0.8% versus the comparable period in the prior year. Net income was $20.6 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010, compared to net income of $21.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. Results for fiscal 2010 include the net charge of $0.07 per diluted share relating to legal matters. Results for fiscal 2009 include the net charge of $0.03 per diluted share relating to legal matters.
"Our business continues to be challenged by the economy in many of our markets, which, along with extreme variances in weather patterns, has created inconsistency in our recent sales trends," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While we achieved same store sales in the positive low-single-digit range for October and positive mid-single-digit range for November, which included the Black Friday' weekend, these gains were offset as our sales turned negative over the key three-week gift shopping period preceding Christmas. Following the holiday season, positive sales trends resumed and continued until mid-January as our markets experienced favorable winter weather conditions. However, sales weakened considerably between mid-January and mid-February, as unseasonably warm and dry weather conditions reduced demand for winter products in many of our markets. Our same store sales are currently running down in the low single-digit range for the quarter to date, compared to a mid-single-digit same store sales increase during the same time period last year."
Mr. Miller continued, "Despite our fourth quarter sales being slightly below expectations, we are pleased to have further strengthened our balance sheet at the end of 2010, as our positive cash flow allowed us to further reduce borrowings under our credit facility by 12% to $48.3 million at year-end compared to the end of fiscal 2009. Our sound financial condition and anticipated continued healthy cash flow has enabled us to enhance shareholder value through the 50 percent dividend increase that we announced today. Although continued uncertainty in the economy and a lack of visibility as to the timing and degree of a recovery has made it difficult to predict consumer demand, we continue to believe that our
 
proven business strategy will positively impact sales, earnings and cash flow, and over the long-term will deliver a solid performance for our shareholders."
The Company's Board of Directors has approved an increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, for an annual rate of $0.30 per share. Previously, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.05 per share, for an annual rate of $0.20 per share. The quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock will be paid on March 22, 2011 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2011.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
For the fiscal 2011 first quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the negative low single-digit to positive low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.22. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.23.
Guidance
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company opened seven new stores, including three relocations of existing stores that have closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 or will close later in the year. The Company's store count at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 398 stores from 384 stores at the end of fiscal 2009. During the first quarter to date, the Company has opened two new stores, both of which were relocations, and closed two stores that were relocated in late 2010. Excluding stores closed as part of relocations that began last year, the Company currently anticipates opening between 10 and 15 net new stores during fiscal 2011.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 3, 2011  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2011 first quarter ended April 3, 2011.
For the fiscal 2011 first quarter, net sales were $221.1 million, compared to net sales of $218.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 0.9% for the first quarter of 2011 versus the comparable period in the prior year. This compares to a same store sales increase of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2010. Sales results in fiscal 2011 reflect a benefit over the prior year from the calendar shift of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the first quarter and into the second quarter this year.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2011 first quarter was $72.2 million, compared to $71.6 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.6% in the fiscal 2011 first quarter versus 32.7% in the first quarter of the prior year. The slight gross profit margin decrease reflects an increase in store occupancy costs related to new store openings, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins of 12 basis points.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.4% in the fiscal 2011 first quarter versus 28.8% in the first quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $4.2 million during the quarter from the prior year due mainly to an increase in store-related expenses, which reflected a higher store count and increased employee benefit costs, as well as increased advertising expense.
 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
"Our sales results for the first quarter were at the lower end of our guidance range and reflect continued macroeconomic weakness in our markets," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in customer traffic, as we believe many of our consumers reduced purchases of discretionary items in response to the challenging economic environment, characterized by rising gas prices and high unemployment. Earnings were lower than our previous expectations primarily due to higher than anticipated expenses associated with employee benefits, including workers' compensation, health and welfare and California unemployment taxes."
Mr. Miller continued, "Sales trends in the second quarter to-date remain challenging as we believe that our consumer continues to be highly sensitive to the adverse economic conditions prevalent in our markets, which are concentrated in the western United States. We continue to look at all aspects of our business in order to drive sales and earnings. We are taking steps to further enhance our merchandise, pricing, and promotional strategies, while remaining focused on operating as efficiently as possible. We believe that our continued emphasis on improving the execution of our overall business model will enable us to weather the current environment and position us well when the consumer climate improves."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2011 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2011.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2011 second quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the flat to negative low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.06 to $0.14. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.22.
Store Openings
During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company opened two new stores, both of which were relocations, and closed two stores as part of relocations that began in late 2010. The Company ended the fiscal 2011 first quarter with 396 stores and anticipates closing one store during the fiscal 2011 second quarter as part of a relocation that began in late 2010. Excluding stores closed as part of relocations that began last year, the Company currently expects to open between 10 and 15 net new stores during fiscal 2011.
 
Conference Call Information

Amendment and Restatement of 2007 Plan
     On June 14, 2011, the stockholders of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's 2007 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (as so amended and restated, the "Amended 2007 Plan"). Generally, the amendment and restatement made the following revisions to the original 2007 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan that had been adopted as of April 24, 2007 (the "Original 2007 Plan"):
     The Amended 2007 Plan had previously been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval. The principal features of the Amended 2007 Plan are summarized below. This summary, however, is not intended to be a complete discussion of all of the terms of the Amended 2007 Plan. A copy of the Amended 2007 Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
     
Shares Subject to the Amended 2007 Plan
     Up to an aggregate of 3,649,250 shares of common stock of the Company are authorized for issuance under the Amended 2007 Plan, plus the number of shares which were subject to awards granted under the Company's previously existing stock option plans (the "Prior Plans") as of April 24, 2007, and which awards are or were forfeited, expired or cancelled without the issuance of shares after the April 24, 2007 effective date of the Original 2007 Plan. This represents an increase of 1,250,000 shares from the amount authorized under the Original 2007 Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares issuable under the Amended 2007 Plan which may be subject to ISOs (as defined below) is 2,399,250 shares, regardless of any such transfer of shares from the Prior Plans to the Amended 2007 Plan.
Table of Contents
     Any shares that are subject to awards of options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against this limit as one share for every one share granted. Any shares that are subject to awards other than options or stock appreciation rights (including shares delivered on the settlement of dividend equivalents) shall be counted against this limit as 2.5 shares for every one share granted. The aggregate number of shares available under the Amended 2007 Plan and the number of shares subject to outstanding options will be increased or decreased to reflect any changes in the outstanding common stock of the Company by reason of any recapitalization, spin-off, reorganization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction.
     If any shares subject to an award under the Amended 2007 Plan or to an award under the Prior Plans are forfeited, expire or are cancelled without issuance of such shares, the shares shall again be available for awards under the Amended 2007 Plan. Any shares that again become available for grant shall be added back as one share if such shares were subject to options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Amended 2007 Plan or options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Prior Plans and as 2.5 shares if such shares were subject to awards other than options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Amended 2007 Plan. Shares which are received or withheld by the Company to satisfy tax liabilities arising from the grant or exercise of an option or award, or as a result of the use of shares to pay the option price, shall not again be available to awards under the Amended 2007 Plan.
     
Eligibility and Participation
     All employees (including officers), directors, and consultants of the Company or any subsidiary are eligible for selection to receive awards under the Amended 2007 Plan, subject to the following restrictions: (1) no ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time of grant, is not an employee of the Company or any subsidiary, and (2) no participant may be granted options or stock appreciation rights during any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 500,000 shares, (3) no participant may be granted restricted stock, performance awards and/or other stock unit awards that are denominated in shares in any fiscal year of the Company with respect to more than 250,000 shares, and (4) the maximum dollar value payable to any participant in any fiscal year of the Company with respect to performance awards and/or other stock unit awards that are valued with reference to cash or property other than shares is $2,000,000. The share limitations set forth above are subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction during any fiscal year of the Company or portion thereof. If an option or stock appreciation right expires or terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full, or if any award is cancelled, the unpurchased shares subject to that expired or terminated option or stock appreciation right or cancelled award continue to be counted against the maximum number of shares for which options or stock appreciation rights or other awards may be granted to a participant during a fiscal year of the Company. Subject to such limitations, an individual who has been granted an option or stock appreciation right or other award may, if such
Table of Contents
individual is otherwise eligible, be granted additional options or stock appreciation rights or other awards as the Committee may determine.
     
Administration of the Amended 2007 Plan
     The Amended 2007 Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), consisting of two or more directors of the Company who are (a) "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and (b) "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and (c) "independent directors" under Nasdaq or other applicable stock exchange rules; except that, so long as the Committee contains at least two such directors that meet the above requirements, the Committee may also include one additional director who does not meet those criteria if he or she abstains or recuses himself or herself in connection with voting on grants and awards to all Covered Employees (as defined in the Amended 2007 Plan) and to all officers of the Company who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Committee has extremely broad discretion and power in interpreting and operating the Amended 2007 Plan and in determining the employees, directors and consultants who shall be participants, and the terms of individual options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards, performance awards, and dividend equivalents. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may delegate to one or more directors or officers the authority to grant awards to employees or officers who are not directors, "covered employees" whose compensation is subject to the limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or officers subject to the short-swing rules of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. For a description of the limitation on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for compensation paid to certain executive officers, see "Federal Income Tax Matters$1,000,000 Limit on Deductible Compensation."
     
Types of Awards
     Awards under the Amended 2007 Plan may consist of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards, performance awards, or dividend equivalents. The nature of each of such type of award is discussed below. Each award will be made by an award agreement whose form and content shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion, consistent with the provisions of the Amended 2007 Plan. The terms of award agreements for a particular type of award need not be uniform.
     
Type of Options
     Two types of options may be granted under the Amended 2007 Plan: options intended to qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, and options not so qualified for favorable federal income tax treatment ("NSOs"). To date, all options issued under the Original 2007 Plan have been non-qualified options.
Table of Contents
     
Stock Appreciation Rights
     The Committee, in its discretion, may also issue stock appreciation rights to employees, consultants and directors of the Company. A stock appreciation right is a right to receive a payment based on the increase in the fair market value of a share after the date of grant. The Committee may determine, in its discretion, that a stock appreciation right will be paid out in cash or in shares on its exercise. The number of shares that may be issued on the exercise of a stock appreciation right shall be determined by dividing: (a) the total number of shares as to which the stock appreciation right is exercised, multiplied by the amount by which the fair market value of one share on the exercise date exceeds the fair market value of one share on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right, by (b) the fair market value of one share on the exercise date; provided, however, that fractional shares shall not be issued and in lieu thereof, a cash adjustment shall be paid. In lieu of issuing shares on the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the Committee may in its sole discretion elect to pay the cash value of such shares. The Committee will not, however, take any action regarding a stock appreciation right, or otherwise under the Amended 2007 Plan, that could subject a participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
     
Restricted Stock
     The Committee, in its discretion, may also grant awards of restricted stock to participants. Restricted stock shall be shares granted or sold to a participant that are subject to vesting restrictions based on continued employment or attainment of performance goals. Subject to the 10% exception described below, restricted stock that is not intended to be "performance based" compensation will not fully vest over a period of less than three years to the extent such vesting occurs solely as a result of the continuous status as an employee, director or consultant (i.e., excluding accelerated vesting in circumstances such as a change of control, retirement, death or disability).
     
Other Stock Unit Awards
     The Committee, in its discretion, may grant other stock unit awards, which are awards valued in whole or part by reference to, or otherwise based on, shares. Other stock unit awards shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be determined by the Committee, and may be payable in the form of cash or shares. Subject to the 10% exception described below, other stock unit awards that are not intended to be "performance based" compensation will not fully vest over a period of less than three years to the extent such vesting occurs solely as a result of the continuous status as an employee, director or consultant (i.e., excluding accelerated vesting in circumstances such as a change of control, retirement, death or disability).
     
Performance Awards and Code
Section 162(m)
Provisions
     The Committee, in its discretion, may issue performance awards to participants, the payment of which will be determined by the achievement of performance goals over a
Table of Contents
performance period. Upon the grant of a performance award, the Committee shall determine the relevant performance goals and the performance period.
     The performance goals shall be based on the attainment of specified levels, or growth, of one or any combination of the following factors, or an objective formula determined at the time of the award that is based on modified or unmodified calculations of one or any combination of the following factors: net sales; pretax income before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the shares or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before taxes; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"); an adjusted formula of EBITDA determined by the Committee; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; reductions in costs, and/or return on invested capital of the Company or any affiliate, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the participant is primarily employed. Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. Unless the Committee determines otherwise when it sets the performance goals for an award, objective adjustments shall be made to any of the foregoing measures for items that will not properly reflect the Company's financial performance for these purposes, such as the write-off of debt issuance costs, pre-opening and development costs, gain or loss from asset dispositions, asset or other impairment charges, litigation settlement costs, and other non-routine items that may occur during the performance period. Also, unless the Committee determines otherwise in setting the performance goals for an award, such performance goals shall be applied by excluding the impact of (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, and charges for extraordinary items, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required or recommended by generally accepted accounting principles.
     Subject to the 10% exception described below, the performance period shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be shorter than one year nor longer than five years.
     Performance awards will generally be paid only after the end of the relevant performance period, and may be paid in cash, shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment.
     The Compensation Committee may determine, in its discretion, that performance awards granted to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deductibility limit of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code will qualify as "performance based" compensation. The Compensation Committee may likewise
Table of Contents
determine that the vesting of restricted stock, and the vesting or payment of any other stock unit award, granted to such an executive officer will be subject to the achievement of the objective performance goals over a performance period, and thus satisfy the requirements to be "performance based" compensation.
     In the case of any performance award, restricted stock, or other stock unit award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, the performance goals and other terms and conditions of the award will be set by the Committee within the time prescribed by Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder. If the performance period is 12 months or longer, such performance goals must be set by the Committee within the first 90 days of the performance period.
     The Committee may adjust downward, but not upward, the amount payable to any executive officer of the Company under any award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation. The Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance goals, except in the case of death or disability of the participant, or the occurrence of a change in control of the Company.
     Before the vesting, payment, settlement or lapsing of any restrictions with respect to any award that is intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, the Committee shall certify in writing that the applicable performance criteria have been achieved to the extent necessary for such award to qualify as "performance based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
     The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on awards intended to constitute "performance based" compensation as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such awards satisfy all requirements to constitute "performance based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m), or which are not inconsistent with such requirements.
     Unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under applicable law or rules approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Amended 2007 Plan at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Amended 2007 Plan, no awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock that is not intended to be "performance based" compensation, shall be made following the date of such meeting to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m). Under currently applicable law or rules, to be duly constituted, a majority of the shares of capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote would have to be present in person or by proxy at the meeting at which stockholders vote to approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Amended 2007 Plan.
Table of Contents
     
10% Exception for Vesting and Performance Periods
     The three-year vesting requirements for restricted stock and other stock unit awards, and the one-year minimum performance period for performance awards, shall not apply with respect to grants in the aggregate of up to 10% of the shares authorized under the Amended 2007 Plan, including shares which become authorized under the Amended 2007 Plan by virtue of cancellations, forfeitures and terminations of awards under the Prior Plans (i.e., approximately 365,000 shares plus 10% of the number of shares which have been since April 24, 2007, or hereafter are, transferred from the Prior Plans).
     
Dividend Equivalents
     The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that a participant who receives an award will also be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to stock or other property dividends on shares ("dividend equivalents") with respect to the number of shares covered by the award. The Committee may also provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional shares or otherwise reinvested. Dividend equivalents credited in connection with an award that vests based on the achievement of performance goals shall be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the award with respect to which such dividend equivalents have been credited. In the event of a recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction, the Committee may, in its discretion, make an appropriate adjustment to dividend equivalents.
     
Option and Other Award Price
     The purchase price for shares covered by each option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant, but if an ISO is granted to a more than 10% shareholder of the Company or its subsidiaries (measured by ownership of voting power), the purchase price of an ISO shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant. The base price for a stock appreciation right shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of shares as of the date of grant. The Committee, in its discretion, may determine the purchase price, if any, for restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards.
     
Exercisability of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights; Vesting of Restricted Stock and Other Awards
     The Committee shall determine when and under what conditions any option or stock appreciation right shall become exercisable and when restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards shall become vested. However, the aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock of the Company (determined at the date of grant) for which ISOs (whenever granted) are exercisable for the first time by a
Table of Contents
participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000; any options in excess of this limit shall be treated as NSOs. The purchase price of shares on the exercise of an option shall be paid in full at the time of exercise in cash or by check payable to the order of the Company, or, subject to the approval of the Committee and subject to applicable law, by the delivery of shares of common stock of the Company already owned by the participant, through a "broker's" exercise involving the immediate sale or pledge of shares with a value sufficient to pay the exercise price, or by any other method permitted by applicable law. The Committee shall determine, in its discretion, the form of any payment for restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance shares.
     
Duration of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
     Each option or stock appreciation right shall expire on the date specified by the Committee, but all options and stock appreciation rights shall expire within 10 years of the date of grant. ISOs granted to more than 10% shareholders of the Company (measured by ownership of voting power) shall expire within five years from the date of grant.
     
No Repricing
     The Committee has no authority to reprice any option, to reduce the base price of any stock appreciation right, or cancel any option and replace it with another award available under the Amended 2007 Plan, including cash, when the fair market value of the underlying shares is less than the option's exercise price per share.
     
Termination of Employment
     If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason (including death or permanent disability) other than termination for cause, the participant's options that were vested and exercisable shall remain exercisable until the end of the original term or for the period determined by the Committee in the individual option agreement or otherwise, whichever expires earlier. After a participant's death, options may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the participant's rights pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Unless the Committee determines otherwise in its discretion, similar rules shall apply to stock appreciation rights. The treatment of each award of restricted stock, other stock unit award, or performance award on the termination of employment, death, or disability of the participant shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. If a participant's employment is terminated for cause, all of his awards may be immediately terminated and canceled, in the Committee's discretion.
     
Certain Corporate Transactions
     Upon the happening of a merger, reorganization or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or other change of control events specified in the Amended
Table of Contents
2007 Plan, the Committee, may, in its sole discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) shorten the period during which options and stock appreciation rights are exercisable (provided they remain exercisable for at least 30 days after the date notice of such shortening is given to the participants); (ii) accelerate in whole or in part any vesting schedule to which an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, other stock unit award or performance award is subject; (iii) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity or any parent entity thereof assume the restricted stock, other stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights or options or grant replacement options or stock appreciation rights with appropriate adjustments in the option prices and adjustments in the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise; (iv) cancel options upon payment to the participants in cash of an amount that is the equivalent of the excess of the fair market value of the common stock of the Company (at the effective time of the merger, reorganization, sale or other event) over the exercise price of the option to the extent the options are vested and exercisable, and cancel stock appreciation rights by paying the value thereof; or (v) make any other modification or adjustment that the Committee deems appropriate in its discretion. The Committee may also provide for one or more of the foregoing alternatives in any particular award agreement.
     
Rights as a Stockholder
     The recipient of an option or stock appreciation right will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Company common stock covered by an option or stock appreciation right until the date such recipient becomes a holder of record of such shares, unless the Committee, in its discretion, elects to grant the participant dividend equivalent rights in connection with such option or stock appreciation right. The recipient of restricted stock or of an other stock unit award will generally have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company issued pursuant to such award, including the right to vote such shares, but the Committee may determine that any dividends and distributions with respect to such shares will be subject to the same vesting restrictions, if any, as the underlying shares.
     
Assignability of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Awards
     An ISO granted under the Amended 2007 Plan shall, by its terms, be non-transferable by the participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by him or her. Any award issued under the Amended 2007 Plan other than an ISO shall be nontransferable by the participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or, with the consent of the Committee, during the participant's lifetime by gift to one or more members of the participant's immediate family or to a trust for their benefit.

Duration, Termination and Amendment of the Amended 2007 Plan; Effectiveness of the Amendment
     The Amended 2007 Plan became effective upon its adoption by the Board on April 26, 2011, subject to the approval of the Amended 2007 Plan by our stockholders within 12 months thereafter, which approval occurred on June 14, 2011. The Amended 2007 Plan shall continue in effect for a period of 10 years following the adoption of the Amended 2007 Plan by the Board (i.e., through April 26, 2021). The Board of Directors, however, may suspend or terminate the Amended 2007 Plan at any time.
     However, unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under applicable law or rules approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Amended 2007 Plan at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Amended 2007 Plan, no awards other than options or stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock that is not intended to constitute "performance based" compensation, shall be made following the date of such meeting to executive officers of the Company whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m). Under currently applicable rules, to be duly constituted, a majority of the shares of capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote would have to be present in person or by proxy at the meeting at which stockholders vote to approve the continuation of the "performance based" compensation provisions of the Amended 2007 Plan. The suspension or termination of the Amended 2007 Plan will generally not affect the validity of any option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, other stock unit award, performance award or dividend equivalent outstanding on the date of termination.
     The Board of Directors may also amend the Amended 2007 Plan at any time, except that the Board will not amend the Amended 2007 Plan in a way which violates Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The Board will not amend the Amended 2007 Plan without obtaining stockholder approval to (a) increase the number of shares that may be the subject of awards under the Amended 2007 Plan, (b) expand the types of awards available under the Amended 2007 Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Amended 2007 Plan, (d) amend any provision prohibiting the Committee from repricing options or taking similar action, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any option, (f) amend the limits on grants of awards to any participant during a 12-month period, or (g) make any modification that requires stockholder approval under applicable law. Furthermore, no amendment of the Amended 2007 Plan shall amend or impair any rights or obligations under any award theretofore granted under the Amended 2007 Plan without the written consent of the holder of the affected award.
     
Federal Income Tax Matters
     The following discussion of federal income tax consequences does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential tax effects of the Amended 2007 Plan. It is
Table of Contents
based upon laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. No information is provided with respect to persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States, or foreign, state or local tax laws, or estate and gift tax considerations. In addition, the tax consequences to a particular participant may be affected by matters not discussed above. ACCORDINGLY, EACH PARTICIPANT IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO HIM OF THE AMENDED 2007 PLAN, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS.
     The Amended 2007 Plan is not subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
     
Non-Qualified Stock Options
     Under current federal income tax law, the grant of an NSO has no tax effect on the Company or the participant. If the shares of common stock of the Company received on the exercise of an NSO are not subject to restrictions on transfer or risk of forfeiture, the exercise of the NSO will result in ordinary income to the participant equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the option price. The participant's tax basis in the shares will be equal to the option price plus the amount of ordinary income recognized upon the exercise of the option. Upon any subsequent disposition of the shares, any gain or loss recognized by the participant will be treated as capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year after exercise. At the time of recognition of ordinary income by the participant upon exercise, the Company will normally be allowed to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to such recognized ordinary income.
     If the shares received on the exercise of an NSO are subject to restrictions on transfer or risk of forfeiture (e.g., a vesting condition), different rules will apply, and the tax consequences will depend on whether the participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code within 30 days after exercise of the option. If the participant does not make a Section 83(b) election, the participant will recognize ordinary income when the shares vest in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value on the date of vesting over the exercise price. In that case, the participant's basis in the shares will be the fair market value of the shares on the date of vesting, and the participant's holding period will begin on the date of vesting. Upon any later disposition of the shares, any gain or loss that the participant recognizes will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the participant holds the shares more than one year after vesting. The Company will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes when the shares vest equal to the amount of ordinary income the participant recognizes.
     On the other hand, if the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise equal to the excess of the fair
Table of Contents
market value on the date of exercise over the exercise price. The Company will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes on the date of exercise equal to the amount of ordinary income he or she recognizes. The participant's basis in the shares will generally begin on the date of exercise, and the participant's basis in the shares will generally be the option price increased by the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized at the time of exercise. Upon any later disposition of the shares, any gain or loss that the participant recognizes will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the participant holds the shares more than one year after exercise. However, if the participant later forfeits the shares, the participant will recognize a capital loss equal to excess (if any) of the option price over any amount the participant receives from the Company on the forfeiture. In other words, if a participant makes the Section 83(b) election and thereby recognizes ordinary income on the date of exercise, the participant will receive no corresponding deduction or loss if the participant later forfeits the shares for the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized.
     
Incentive Stock Options
     The federal income tax consequences associated with ISOs are generally more favorable to the participant and less favorable to the Company than those associated with NSOs. Under current federal income tax law, the grant of an ISO does not result in income to the participant or in a deduction for the Company at the time of the grant. Generally, the exercise of an ISO will not result in income for the participant if the participant does not dispose of the shares within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the date of exercise. If these requirements are met, the basis of the shares of common stock of the Company upon a later disposition will be the option price, any gain on the later disposition will be taxed to the participant as long-term capital gain, and the Company will not be entitled to a deduction. The excess of the market value on the exercise date over the option price is an adjustment to regular taxable income in determining alternative minimum taxable income, which could cause the participant to be subject to the alternative minimum tax, thereby in effect depriving the participant of the tax benefits of ISO treatment. If the participant disposes of the shares before the expiration of either of the holding periods described above (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the participant will have compensation taxable as ordinary income, and the Company will normally be entitled to a deduction, equal to the lesser of (a) the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date minus the option price, or (b) the amount realized on the disposition minus the option price. If the price realized in any such Disqualifying Disposition of the shares exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date, the excess will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain, depending on the participant's holding period for the shares.
     
Stock Appreciation Rights
     A participant holding a stock appreciation right will recognize ordinary income on the exercise of the stock appreciation right equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of the shares he receives on the exercise. The Company will receive a tax
Table of Contents
deduction in the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
     
Other Awards
     The taxation of an award other than an option or a stock appreciation right depends on whether or not it consists of restricted stock (i.e., stock subject to a vesting restriction based on continued employment or attainment of performance goals). If an other stock unit award or a performance award does not consist of restricted stock, and is not settled in restricted stock, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the receipt of cash or shares equal to the amount of cash, or the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the amount (if any) that the participant pays for the shares. The Company will receive a tax deduction in the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
     In general, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant at the time restricted stock is granted. Generally, on the date the restricted stock becomes vested, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares vest and the purchase price, and the Company will receive a tax deduction for the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of vesting as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
     Alternatively, a participant may elect to make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to unvested shares. If a participant makes a Section 83(b) election with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date of grant, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and the purchase price, and the Company will receive a tax deduction for the same amount. If the participant makes a timely Section 83(b) election, the participant will not recognize ordinary income when the shares vest. Upon disposition of the shares acquired, the participant will recognize the appreciation or depreciation on the shares after the date of grant as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held. If the participant forfeits unvested shares, the participant will recognize a capital loss equal to the excess (if any) of the purchase price over any amount the participant receives from the Company on the forfeiture. Generally, if the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, and thereby recognizes ordinary income on the date of grant, the participant will receive no corresponding deduction or loss for the amount of ordinary income the participant recognized if the participant later forfeits any unvested shares.
Table of Contents
     
$1,000,000 Limit on Deductible Compensation
     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that any publicly-traded corporation will be denied a deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers to the extent that the compensation exceeds $1,000,000 per officer per year. However, the deduction limit does not apply to "performance based" compensation, as defined in Section 162(m). Compensation is performance based compensation if (i) the compensation is payable on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals; (ii) the performance goals are established by a compensation committee of the Board of Directors of directors consisting of "outside directors"; (iii) the material terms of the compensation and the performance goals are disclosed to and approved by the stockholders in a separate vote; and (iv) the compensation committee certifies that the performance goals have been satisfied. The Company believes that, if the stockholders approve the Amended 2007 Plan, the stock options and stock appreciation rights granted thereunder will satisfy the requirements to be treated as performance based compensation, and accordingly will not be subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. As discussed above, the Committee may determine that restricted stock, other stock unit awards, and performance awards granted to executive officers whose compensation is subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) will also qualify as performance based compensation. Restricted stock whose vesting is based solely on the completion by the recipient of a stated period of service with the Company will not qualify as performance based compensation.
     
Excess Parachute Payments
     Under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain officers, stockholders, or highly- compensated individuals ("Disqualified Individuals") will be subject to an excise tax (in addition to federal income taxes) of 20% of the amount of certain "excess parachute payments" which they receive as a result of a change in control of the Company. Furthermore, Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code prevents the Company from taking a deduction for any "excess parachute payments." The cash out or acceleration of the vesting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards or performance awards upon a change of control may cause the holders of such stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock unit awards and performance awards who are Disqualified Individuals to recognize certain amounts as "excess parachute payments" on which they must pay the 20% excise tax, and for which the Company will be denied a tax deduction.
     
Special Rules; Withholding of Taxes
     Special tax rules may apply to a participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Other special tax rules will apply if a participant exercises a stock option by delivering shares of Company common stock which he or she already owns, or through a "broker's exercise."
Table of Contents
     The Company may take whatever steps the Committee deems appropriate to comply with any applicable withholding tax obligation in connection with the exercise of an option or stock appreciation right or the grant or vesting of restricted stock, other stock unit awards, or performance awards, including requiring any participant to pay the amount of any applicable withholding tax to the Company in cash. The Committee may, in its discretion, authorize "cashless withholding."

     5.6 . In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or other similar securities, or may reserve the right so to provide after the time of grant.
Form of Settlement

With respect to the Options that may be granted by the Committee under the Plan, the Committee may grant Options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options to any Employee of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, subject to the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. The Award Agreement of an Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option shall designate the Option as an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.1 to the contrary and solely for the purposes of determining whether Shares are available for the grant of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options may be granted under the Plan shall be 2,399,250 Shares. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five years from the date of grant or any shorter term specified in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Shares subject to an Employee's Incentive Stock Options (granted under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary), which become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year, have a Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000, the Options accounting for this excess will be not be treated as Incentive Stock Options. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time of grant.
Incentive Stock Options
     5.8 . If a Participant holds exercisable Options on the date his or her Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than because of termination due to Cause, but including death or Disability), the Participant may exercise the Options that were vested and exercisable as of the date of termination until the end of the original term or for the period set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee, whichever is earlier. If the Participant is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option at the date of such termination, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option will revert to the Plan, unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee. The Committee may determine in its sole discretion that such unexercisable portion of the Option will become exercisable at such times and on such terms as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. If the Participant does not exercise an Option within the time specified after termination, that Option will expire, and the Shares covered by it will revert to the Plan, except as otherwise determined by the Committee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2, but subject to Section 12.2, a Stock Appreciation Right shall not have (i) an exercise price less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant, or (ii) a term of greater than ten years. In addition to the foregoing, but subject to Section 12.2, the base amount of any Stock Appreciation Right shall not be reduced after the date of grant.
     6.3 . If a Participant holds exercisable Stock Appreciation Rights on the date his or her Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than because of termination due to Cause, but including death or Disability), the Participant may exercise the Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested and exercisable as of the date of termination until the end of the original term or for the period set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee, whichever is earlier. If the Participant is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Stock Appreciation Right at the date of such termination, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right will revert to the Plan, unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement or determined by the Committee. The Committee may determine in its sole discretion that such unexercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right will become exercisable at such times and on such terms as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. If the Participant does not exercise a Stock Appreciation Right within the time specified after termination, that Stock Appreciation Right will expire, and the Shares covered by it will revert to the Plan, except as otherwise determined by the Committee.
Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship or Directorship
     7.1 . Awards of Restricted Stock may be issued hereunder to Participants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan (a ""). A Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to restrictions imposed by the Committee covering a period of time specified by the Committee (the ""); provided, however, that, in the case of Restricted Stock as to which restrictions lapse based solely on the recipient's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant, the Restricted Period over which the restrictions may fully lapse shall not be less than three years, but the restrictions may lapse ratably over such Restricted Period. At the Committee's sole and absolute discretion, the three year restriction in the preceding sentence shall not be applicable to Restricted Stock Award grants of up to 10% of the number of Shares authorized for Awards under Section 3.1(a) of the Plan (for this purpose, the 10% limit shall be computed by taking into account grants under Sections 8 and 9 of the Plan that are subject to the 10% limit). The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether any consideration (other than services) is to be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the issuance of Restricted Stock.

Other Stock Unit Awards shall be paid in Shares or cash.

At the Committee's sole and absolute discretion, the three year restriction in the preceding sentence shall not be applicable to Other Stock Unit Award grants of up to 10% of the number of Shares authorized for Awards under Section 3.1(a) of the Plan (for this purpose, the 10% limit shall be computed by taking into account grants under Sections 7 and 9 of the Plan that are subject to the 10% limit).

Other Stock Unit Awards
Other Stock Unit Awards
     8.2 . Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) subject to Awards granted under this Article 8 may be issued for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by Applicable Law.

Terms and Conditions
     9.1 . Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by Applicable Law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan. The performance criteria to be achieved during any Performance Period and the length of the Performance Period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided, however, that a Performance Period shall not be shorter than one year nor longer than five years. At the Committee's sole and absolute discretion, the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence shall not be applicable to grants of up to 10% of the number of Shares authorized for Awards under Section 3.1(a) of the Plan (for this purpose, the 10% limit shall be computed by taking into account grants under Sections 7 and 8 of the Plan that are subject to the 10% limit). Except as provided in Article 11 or as may be provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant Performance Period. Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. The performance goals to be achieved for each Performance Period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 10.2. The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee. The terms of a Performance Award may provide that it will be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the Performance Period.
Terms of Performance Awards
     10.1 . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee determines at the time Restricted Stock, a Performance Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is granted to a Participant who is, or may be, as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction
Covered Employees
 
in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, and that the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Code might apply to such Award, then the Committee may provide that this Article 10 is applicable to such Award.
     10.2 . If Restricted Stock, a Performance Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is subject to this Article 10, then the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of cash, Shares or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Committee, which shall be based on the attainment of specified levels, or growth, of one or any combination of the following factors, or an objective formula that is determined at the time of the Award that is based on modified or unmodified calculations of one or any combination of the following factors: net sales; pretax income before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Shares or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before taxes; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""); an adjusted formula of EBITDA determined by the Committee; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; reductions in costs, and/or return on invested capital of the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed. Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise when it sets the performance goals for an award, objective adjustments shall be made to any of the foregoing measures for items that will not properly reflect the Company's financial performance for these purposes, such as the write-off of debt issuance costs, pre-opening and development costs, gain or loss from asset dispositions, asset or other impairment charges, litigation settlement costs, and other non-routine items that the Committee foresees may occur during the Performance Period. Also, unless the Committee determines otherwise in setting the performance goals for an Award, such performance goals shall be applied by excluding the impact of (a) restructurings, discontinued operations and charges for extraordinary items, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
Performance Criteria
EBITDA
     10.3 . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan (other than Article 11), with respect to any Restricted Stock, Performance Award or Other Stock Unit Award that is subject to this Article 10, the Committee may adjust downward, but not upward, the amount payable pursuant to such Award, and the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance goals, except in the case of the death or Disability of the Participant or the occurrence of a Change of Control.
Adjustments
     10.4 . Prior to the vesting, payment, settlement or lapsing of any restrictions with respect to any Restricted Stock, Performance Award or Other Stock Unit Award that is subject to this Article 10, the Committee shall certify in writing that the applicable performance goals have been achieved to the extent necessary for such Award to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.
Determination of Performance
     10.5 . The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Article 10 as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, or which are not inconsistent with such requirements. To the extent the terms of an Award subject to this Article 10 are inconsistent with the requirements set forth herein, such inconsistent terms shall be deemed amended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code in the manner is most consistent with the pre-amendment terms.
Restrictions
 
     11.1 . The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award, or the Committee may determine in its discretion, that, upon a Change of Control of the Company, (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change of Control immediately vest and become exercisable in full or in part, (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock lapse and the Restricted Stock becomes free of some or all restrictions and limitations and becomes partially or fully vested, (c) Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable (either in full or pro-rata based on the portion of Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change of Control), and any deferral or other restriction shall lapse and such Performance Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed, (d) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Stock Unit Awards or any other Awards shall lapse in full or in part, and such Other Stock Unit Awards or such other Awards shall become free of some or all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become partially or fully vested and transferable, and (e) such other additional benefits, changes or adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate shall apply, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company, (a) each Option and Stock Appreciation Right shall remain exercisable for only a limited period of time determined by the Committee (provided that they remain exercisable for at least 30 days after notice of such action is given to the Participants), or (b) each Option and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the Participant, and such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control over the exercise price per share of such Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Section 11.2, the Committee will take no action that would subject any Participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code.
Impact of Change of Control
     11.2 . The terms of any Award Agreement may also provide that, if in the event of a Change of Control the successor company assumes or substitutes for an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award, then each outstanding Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award shall not be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1(a), (b) and (d). For the purposes of this Section 11.2, an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Share of Restricted Stock or Other Stock Unit Award shall be considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change of Control the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award or Other Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a Change of Control by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award or Other Stock Unit Award, for each Share subject thereto, will be solely common stock of the successor company substantially equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction constituting a Change of Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination shall be conclusive and binding. Any assumption or substitution of an Incentive Stock Option will be made in a manner that will not be considered a "modification" under the provisions of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Award Agreement may provide that, in the event of a termination of a Participant's employment in such successor company within a specified time period following such Change of Control, all or part of any such Award held by such Participant at the time of the Change of Control shall be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1(a), (b) and (d) above.
Assumption Upon Change of Control
 
     12.1 . The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by Applicable Law; provided that the Board may not amend the Plan in any manner that would result in noncompliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.2), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) amend any provision of Section 5.3, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option specified by Section 5.4, or (f) amend any provision of Section 3.2. In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan (other than by reason of the failure of stockholders to approve the Plan in the manner set forth in Section 13.12) shall in any way impair the rights of a Participant under any Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.
Amendment and Modification of the Plan
     12.2 . In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares or the value thereof, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in the aggregate number, class and kind of securities that may be delivered under the Plan and, in the aggregate or to any one Participant, in the number, class, kind and option or exercise price of securities subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company) as the Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. Where an adjustment under this Section 12.2 is made to an Incentive Stock Option, the adjustment will be made in a manner which will not be considered a "modification" under the provisions of Sections 409A or 424(h)(3) of the Code.
Adjustments
     12.3 . Except as provided below, no Award, and no Shares subject to Awards that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such Award may be exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Committee so authorizes in the Award Agreement or otherwise, an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option may be assigned, in whole or in part, during the Participant's lifetime to one or more Family Members of the Participant. Rights under the assigned portion may be exercised by the Family Member(s) who acquire a proprietary interest in such Award pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the Award immediately before such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Committee deems appropriate.
Transferability of Awards
          (a) . A Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any Awards that remain unexercised in the event of the Participant's death. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for the designation to be effective. The Participant may change such designation of beneficiary at any time by written notice to the Committee, subject to the above spousal consent requirement.
Designation of Beneficiary
          (b) . If a Participant dies and there is no beneficiary validly designated and living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will deliver such Participant's Awards to the executor or administrator of his or her estate, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such Awards to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
Effect of No Designation
 
          (c) . If a Participant designates his or her spouse as beneficiary, that designation will be deemed automatically revoked if the Participant's marriage is later dissolved. Similarly, any designation of a beneficiary will be deemed automatically revoked upon the death of the beneficiary if the beneficiary predeceases the Participant. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the interest in Awards of a spouse of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant or whose marriage has been dissolved will automatically pass to the Participant, and will not be transferable by such spouse in any manner, including but not limited to such spouse's will, nor will any such interest pass under the laws of intestate succession.
Death of Spouse or Dissolution of Marriage
     12.4 . The Committee shall determine and set forth in each Award Agreement whether any Awards granted in such Award Agreement will continue to be exercisable, and the terms of such exercise, on and after the date that a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant ceases, whether by reason of death, disability, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or services, or otherwise. The date of termination of a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant will be determined by the Committee, which determination will be final.
Termination of Employment
     12.5 . Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to stock or other property dividends on Shares ("") with respect to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dividend Equivalents credited in connection with Awards subject to Section 10 of the Plan shall be subject to the same restrictions and risks of forfeiture as the Awards with respect to which such Dividend Equivalents have been credited.
Dividend Equivalents
Dividend Equivalents
     13.1 . The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (or to the Participant's executors, administrators, guardian, beneficiary, or legal representative, or Family Members) (any such person, a "") net of any applicable Federal, State and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Rights, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award, or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Payee such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Payee to pay such withholding taxes. If the Payee shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Payee or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the employee's minimum required tax withholding rate) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award. If Shares acquired upon exercise of any Incentive Stock Option are disposed of in a disposition that, under Section 422 of the Code, disqualifies the holder from the application of Section 421(a) of the Code, the holder of the Shares immediately before the disposition will comply with any requirements imposed by the Company in order to enable the Company to secure the related income tax deduction to which it is entitled in such event.
Tax Withholding
Payee
     13.2 . Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Employee, Consultant or Director the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any
Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Awards
 
such Employee, Consultant or Director at any time for any reason. The Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
     13.3 . The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise complied with the then applicable terms and conditions.
Prospective Recipient
     13.4 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant may be canceled in the discretion of the Committee if the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant is terminated for Cause, or if, after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant, the Committee determines that Cause existed before such termination.
Cancellation of Award
     13.5 . All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the provisions of this Plan, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
Stop Transfer Orders
     13.6 . All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan and any Stock Appreciation Rights constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
Nature of Payments
     13.7 . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
Other Plans
     13.8 . If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
Severability
     13.9 . All references in the Plan to "" "" or "" are intended to refer to the Section, Sections or Article, as the case may be, of the Plan.

     13.10 . The Plan is intended to constitute an "" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.
Unfunded Status of the Plan
unfunded
     13.11 . The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and construed accordingly.
Governing Law
     13.12 . The Plan shall be effective as of April 26, 2011, subject to the approval of the Plan, within 12 months thereafter, by affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under Applicable Laws at a duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if stockholders of the Company do not approve the Plan, the Plan shall be void and null and the Original Plan shall continue in full force and effect. If the stockholders of the Company do not approve the Plan in the manner set forth herein, all Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to the terms of the Original Plan. If the Company's stockholders approve the Plan as set forth above, Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan (unless the Board sooner suspends or terminates the Plan under Section 12.1), on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan (which Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired). Assuming approval by the stockholders of the Plan and notwithstanding the foregoing, unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under Applicable Laws approve the continuation of Article 10 at the first duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Plan, no Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or Restricted Stock that is not intended to satisfy the requirements of Article 10, shall be made to Covered Employees following the date of such meeting.
Effective Date of Plan; Termination of Plan
ab initio
     13.13 . Awards may be granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law or tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home country.
Foreign Employees
     13.14 . Upon approval of the Original Plan by the Company's stockholders on June 19, 2007, the Prior Plans were automatically cancelled, effective as of April 24, 2007 (the effective date of the Original Plan), and no further grants or awards could thereafter be made under the Prior Plans. Grants and awards made under the Prior Plans before the date of such cancellation, however, shall continue in effect in accordance with their terms.
Prior Plans
     13.15 . Shares available for Awards under the Plan may be used by the Company as a form of payment of compensation under other Company compensation plans, whether or not existing on the date hereof. To the extent any Shares are used as such by the Company, such Shares will reduce the then number of Shares available under Article 3 of the Plan for future Awards.

     4.10 The validity, legality or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected even if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.
Severability.
     4.11 . The Grantee acknowledges that, in the event of a threatened or actual breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, damages alone will be an inadequate remedy, and such breach will cause the Company great, immediate and irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, the Grantee agrees that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, and that such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any remedies they may have at law or under this Agreement.
Equitable Relief
     4.12 .
Arbitration
          4.12.1 . Any controversy, dispute, or claim between the parties to this Agreement, including any claim arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, before a single arbitrator, in accordance with this Section 4.12 and the then most applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for determining any such dispute, regardless of its nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may in an appropriate matter apply to a court for provisional relief, including a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, on the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled in arbitration may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. Unless mutually agreed by the parties otherwise, any arbitration shall take place in the City of Los Angeles, California.
General
          4.12.2 . In the event the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from a list of nine arbitrators drawn by the parties at random from a list of twenty persons (who shall be retired judges or corporate or litigation attorneys experienced in stock options and buy-sell agreements) provided by the office of the
Selection of Arbitrator
 
American Arbitration Association having jurisdiction over the City of Los Angeles, California. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the list so drawn, then the parties shall each strike names alternately from the list, with the first to strike being determined by lot. After each party has used four strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator. If such person is unable to serve for any reason, the parties shall repeat this process until an arbitrator is selected.
          4.12.3 . This agreement to resolve any disputes by binding arbitration shall extend to claims against any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity, any officer, director, shareholder, employee or agent of each party, or of any of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising out of state and federal statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the common law. In the event of a dispute subject to this paragraph, the parties shall be entitled to reasonable discovery subject to the discretion of the arbitrator. The remedial authority of the arbitrator (which shall include the right to grant injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be the same as, but no greater than, would be the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the parties and their dispute. The arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim without an evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that he or it would be entitled to summary judgment if the matter had been pursued in court litigation. In the event of a conflict between the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association and these procedures, the provisions of these procedures shall govern.
Applicability of Arbitration; Remedial Authority
          4.12.4 . Any filing or administrative fees shall be borne initially by the party requesting arbitration. The Company shall be responsible for the costs and fees of the arbitration, unless the Grantee wishes to contribute (up to 50%) of the costs and fees of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prevailing party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing party's costs (including but not limited to the arbitrator's compensation), expenses, and attorneys' fees.
Fees and Costs
          4.12.5 . The arbitrator shall render an award and written opinion, and the award shall be final and binding upon the parties. If any of the provisions of this paragraph, or of this Agreement, are determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry out its provisions to the greatest extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all conflicts between the parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration decision and award to be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action, given great weight by any finder of fact, and treated as determinative to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Award Final and Binding; Severability
     4.13 . The section headings in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of any particular section.
Headings
     4.14 . Throughout this Agreement, as the context may require, (a) the masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter gender includes the masculine and the feminine; (b) the singular tense and number includes the plural, and the plural tense and number

includes the singular; (c) the past tense includes the present, and the present tense includes the past; and (d) references to parties, sections, paragraphs and exhibits mean the parties, sections, paragraphs and exhibits of and to this Agreement.

Counterparts
     4.16 . The Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan constitute the parties' entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all agreements, representations, warranties, statements, promises and understandings, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

ROVISIONS
Contractor agrees not to criticize, denigrate, or otherwise disparage Company, any other Released Party (as defined in the General Release of Claims attached as Exhibit A hereto), or any of their products, processes, policies, practices or standards of business conduct. However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit Contractor from complying with any lawful subpoena or court order or taking any other actions affirmatively authorized by law.
16.1
Nondisparagement
.
The compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement are not intended to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""). To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. If Company and Contractor determine that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be or become subject to Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance, Company and Contractor agree to amend this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take such other actions as Company deems necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance; provided, however, if such results are impossible or infeasible, Contractor's right to payments of any amount that otherwise would be subject to the additional taxes imposed by Code Section 409A shall lapse.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California without reference to any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Contractor irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, for any suit or action arising from or related to this Agreement, and waives any right Contractor may have to object to the venue of such courts. Contractor further agrees that these courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over any such suit or action initiated by Contractor against Company.
16.3
Governing Law; Venue.
Any dispute, claim or controversy based on, arising out of or relating to Contractor's employment or other service relationship with Company or this Agreement or otherwise arising between Company and the Contractor shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California, before a single neutral arbitrator experienced in commercial law (selected from the JAMS panel of arbitrators) in accordance with the applicable entity's then current commercial arbitration rules (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement). Contractor also agrees to arbitrate, pursuant to this Section 16.4, any dispute Contractor has with any Company employee, officer, director, or agent, to the extent such individual or individuals consent to arbitration. Company and the Contractor waive the right to institute a court action, except for requests for injunctive relief pending arbitration, and understand that each is giving up the right to a jury trial. The arbitrator's award and opinion shall be in writing and in the form typically rendered in commercial arbitrations. Company will pay any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator, unless Contractor initiates the claim, in which case the Contractor will only be required to contribute an amount equal to the filing fee for a claim initiated in a court of general jurisdiction in California. Each of the parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs; however, the arbitrator may award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. This arbitration agreement does not prohibit either party from filing a claim with an administrative agency, nor does it apply to claims for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits, or claims for benefits under an employee welfare or pension plan that specifies a different dispute resolution procedure.
16.4
Arbitration

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Severability.
This Agreement and Contractor's rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned, delegated, or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by Contractor without Company's express prior written consent. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and

Company's remedies for any breach of this Agreement by Contractor will include damages, injunctive relief, specific performance, and restitution.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., August 2, 2011  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2011 second quarter and first six months ended July 3, 2011.
For the fiscal 2011 second quarter, net sales were $219.6 million, compared to net sales of $219.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 1.7% for the second quarter of 2011 versus the comparable period in the prior year. As anticipated, second quarter sales were negatively affected by the calendar shift of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the first quarter and into the second quarter this year.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2011 second quarter was $71.8 million, compared to $73.0 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.7% in the fiscal 2011 second quarter versus 33.2% in the second quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin reflects a decline of 75 basis points in merchandise margins resulting primarily from an increase in promotional activities and inflationary product cost pressure.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.5% in the fiscal 2011 second quarter versus 29.6% in the second quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $1.8 million during the quarter from the prior year due primarily to an increase in store-related expenses as a result of an increased store count, as well as a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.6 million related to certain underperforming stores.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $3.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, including the non-cash impairment charge of $0.02 per diluted share. For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, net income was $4.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share.
For the 26-week period ended July 3, 2011, net sales increased $2.4 million, or 0.5%, to $440.7 million from net sales of $438.3 million in the 26 weeks ended July 4, 2010. Same store sales decreased 1.3% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2011 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $5.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, including the $0.02 impairment charge, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2011, compared to net income of $9.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the first half of last year.
"During the second quarter, we continued to battle very challenging economic headwinds in the majority of our markets, which remain among the areas most adversely impacted by unemployment and foreclosures in the nation," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We experienced a decline in customer traffic, as we believe our consumer again reduced purchases of discretionary items in response to the difficult environment. Sales softened further during most of May and early June, as unseasonably cool weather in many of our markets impacted sales of summer related products. When warm summer weather arrived in many of our key markets toward the end of the quarter, our sales improved, enabling us to comp positively for the month of June."
Mr. Miller continued, "As we look to the second half of fiscal 2011, we continue to take steps to enhance our merchandise, pricing and promotional strategies. We believe these efforts will allow us to more effectively work through these challenging times and position us well when the economic environment improves."

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 1, 2011  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2011 third quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2011.
For the fiscal 2011 third quarter, net sales were $234.7 million, compared to net sales of $231.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 0.1% for the third quarter of 2011 versus the comparable period last year, when same store sales increased 2.0% over the prior year. Sales results reflect continued weakness in the consumer environment, which contributed to a decrease in customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average sales ticket.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2011 third quarter was $77.0 million, compared to $77.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.8% in the fiscal 2011 third quarter versus 33.4% in the third quarter of last year. The decrease in gross profit margin primarily resulted from a decline of 40 basis points in merchandise margins, reflecting the impact of promotional activities and product cost inflation.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 28.8% in the fiscal 2011 third quarter versus 28.6% in the third quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and
administrative expense increased $1.2 million during the quarter from the prior year due primarily to an increase in store-related expenses as a result of new store openings.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $5.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, versus net income of $6.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the 39-week period ended October 2, 2011, net sales were $675.4 million compared to net sales of $670.1 million in the 39 weeks ended October 3, 2010. Same store sales decreased 0.9% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2011 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $11.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, including a $0.02 non-cash impairment charge, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2011, compared to net income of $16.6 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of last year.
"We are pleased to have exceeded our earnings guidance for the third quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The earnings upside was driven by better than expected merchandise margins and favorable operating expenses. After a soft start to the quarter that we believe was largely attributable to unfavorable weather conditions in many of our markets, sales trends improved during August and September and we comped up in the low single-digit range over the back half of the quarter. We produced positive same store sales in both our apparel and footwear categories for the quarter, while our hardgoods category comped slightly down."
Mr. Miller continued, "While we are pleased to report that positive sales trends have continued into the fourth quarter, we should note that consumer spending during the upcoming holiday season remains highly unpredictable. We are encouraged by our new merchandise and marketing initiatives and remain focused on identifying opportunities to broaden the reach of both our product and customer base."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 15, 2011 to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2011.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low to low-mid single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.12 to $0.24. The Company's sales guidance is subject to the impact of consumer demand during the important holiday selling period, for which there is a large degree of uncertainty. A material improvement or decline in the overall consumer environment could materially impact the Company's performance relative to this guidance. The Company's earnings guidance assumes continued merchandise margin pressure resulting from product cost inflation. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010 were $0.18, including a charge of $0.07 per diluted share related to legal matters.
Store Openings
The Company opened three new stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing its store count at the end of the quarter to 398 stores. The Company has opened two new stores during the fourth quarter to date, and anticipates opening an additional six new stores over the remainder of the fourth quarter. Excluding stores closed as part of relocations that began last year, the Company now expects to open 11 net new stores during fiscal 2011.
Amended Credit Facility
On October 31, 2011, the Company amended the terms of its existing $140 million revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the term of the facility to October 2016, reduce the interest rates charged on borrowings, reduce the fee charged for the unused portion of the facility and modify provisions for restricting certain payments and investments. Following the amendment, LIBO rate loans under the credit facility will bear interest based on LIBO rates plus a variable margin rate of 1.50% to 2.00% based on the remaining availability under the credit line.
Conference Call Information

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., January 11, 2012  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported sales results for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year ended January 1, 2012.
For the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, net sales were $226.7 million, compared to net sales of $226.7 million for fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 2.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company achieved same store sales growth in the low mid-single-digit range through the first half of the quarter. During the second half of the quarter, a lack of winter weather in most of the Company's major markets had a negative effect on sales of winter products, particularly winter apparel, and was a large driver of negative sales trends. Excluding sales of winter-related products, same store sales for the quarter were slightly positive. The Company's merchandise margins decreased 190 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting the largely anticipated impacts of product cost inflation and increased promotional activities, as well as the sales mix shift away from higher margin winter product categories.
For the fiscal 2011 full year, net sales increased to $902.1 million from $896.8 million for the fiscal 2010 full year. Same store sales decreased 1.2% for the fiscal 2011 full year.
For the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.05. During the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, the Company's earnings per diluted share were $0.18, including a net charge of $0.07 per diluted share related to legal matters. For the fiscal 2011 full year, the Company now expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.55 to $0.58, compared to earnings per diluted share in the prior year of $0.94, including the net charge of $0.07 per diluted share for legal matters.
"We are disappointed with our fourth quarter sales results, particularly given that same store sales were solidly positive through the first half of the quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The holiday selling period was below expectations as our results were heavily impacted by a lack of favorable winter weather in most of our markets and a highly promotional environment. Although sales trends picked up during the week before Christmas, after-Christmas sales were particularly soft, with winter-related product categories significantly underperforming expectations as winter weather conditions grew increasingly unfavorable in our markets. The adverse weather conditions throughout the second half of the quarter negatively impacted sales in all of our major merchandise categories, particularly apparel sales, which comped down mid-single digits for the quarter. Sales in our footwear and hardgoods categories decreased in the low single-digit range. Despite the weaker than anticipated sales, we effectively managed our inventory position, ending the quarter with preliminary per-store inventories up just 2.2% from the prior year, which is significantly improved from the end of the third quarter, when per-store inventories were up 11.4% over the prior year."
The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year by the end of February.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., February 28, 2012  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year ended January 1, 2012.
As the Company previously reported, net sales for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter were $226.7 million, compared to net sales of $226.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 2.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter was $70.7 million, compared to $75.8 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 31.2% in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter versus 33.4% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by lower merchandise margins of 190 basis points reflecting the largely anticipated impacts of product cost inflation and increased promotional activities, as well as a product sales mix shift away from higher margin winter product categories due to unfavorable winter weather conditions.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 31.3% in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter versus 30.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to flat year-over-year net sales combined with higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count and increased advertising expense. Selling and administrative expense for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter includes a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to certain underperforming stores.
The Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of $9,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, including the non-cash impairment charge of $0.05 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, net income was $4.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, including a net charge of $0.07 per diluted share related to legal matters.
For the fiscal 2011 full year, net sales increased to $902.1 million from net sales of $896.8 million for fiscal 2010. Same store sales decreased 1.2% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010. Net income in fiscal 2011 was $11.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, including non-cash impairment charges of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income in fiscal 2010 of $20.6 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, including the net charge of $0.07 per diluted share for legal matters.
"As we previously reported, our fourth quarter performance was impacted by negative same store sales over the second half of the quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although same store sales were positive over the first half of the quarter, the holiday selling period was below expectations as our results were heavily influenced by a lack of favorable winter weather in most of our markets and a highly promotional environment."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the first quarter of 2012, we have continued to experience poor winter weather conditions and reduced demand for winter products in most of our geographic markets. Despite the adverse impact of the weather on our winter product sales, we are encouraged by the positive performance of a number of our other key product categories that have begun to benefit from new merchandise initiatives. We remain focused on refining our merchandise mix and adjusting our promotional and marketing plans to better appeal to today's consumer. We are pleased with the early results of these efforts, and are excited about the potential positive effect on upcoming seasons."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on March 22, 2012 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2012.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 109,550 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $1.0 million. As of the end of fiscal 2011, the Company had approximately $13.2 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2012 first quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the negative low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.00 to $0.06. This guidance reflects anticipated continued pressure on merchandise margins reflecting the impacts of product cost inflation and increased promotional activities, as well as a product sales mix shift away from higher margin winter product categories due to unfavorable winter weather conditions. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $0.13.
Store Openings
The Company opened eight new stores during the fourth quarter, bringing its store count at the end of fiscal 2011 to 406 stores from 398 stores at the end of fiscal 2010. During the fiscal 2012 first quarter, the Company anticipates opening one new store, which is a relocation of an existing store that is expected to close later in the year. For the fiscal 2012 full year, the Company currently anticipates opening approximately ten new stores and relocating approximately seven stores.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 1, 2012  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2012 first quarter ended April 1, 2012.
For the fiscal 2012 first quarter, net sales were $218.5 million, compared to net sales of $221.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Same store sales decreased 2.9% for the first quarter of 2012. The Company's first quarter sales were negatively affected by a lack of winter weather in most of the Company's geographic markets, which significantly reduced demand for cold weather apparel and footwear and snow-related products.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2012 first quarter was $67.4 million, compared to $72.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 30.9% in the fiscal 2012 first quarter versus 32.6% in the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by lower merchandise margins of 156 basis points reflecting the product sales mix shift away from higher margin winter-related products due to unfavorable winter weather conditions, as well as increased promotional activities and product cost inflation.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.5% in the fiscal 2012 first quarter versus 30.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense decreased $0.7 million during the quarter from the prior year due mainly to a reduction in employee benefit-related costs from higher than normal levels in the prior year period, as well as a reduction in debit card fees as a result of recent federal legislation.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $156,000, or $0.01 per diluted share. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, net income was $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.
"Our results for the first quarter reflect the challenging economic conditions in our western markets and, most significantly, highly unfavorable winter weather conditions in most of our major geographic areas, which led to an over 25% decrease in winter-related product sales for the period," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Excluding winter-related products, our sales performed positively in the first quarter and strength in non-winter merchandise has continued into the start of the second quarter as we move beyond the winter selling season. Our same store sales are currently running in the positive low single-digit range for the second quarter to date. We believe the positive trends in our business reflect the early benefits of our ongoing initiatives to refine our merchandising mix and adjust our promotional and marketing plans to better appeal to today's consumer."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on June 15, 2012 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2012.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2012 first quarter, the Company repurchased 172,471 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $1.4 million. As of the end of the first quarter, the Company had approximately $11.8 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2012 second quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.05 to $0.11. This guidance assumes that merchandise margin comparisons to the prior year will be negative, but significantly improved relative to the year-over-year comparisons experienced in the first quarter. Guidance also anticipates a small negative impact from the calendar shift of the July 4
th
holiday further into the third quarter, as well as an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, to provide for the closing of three stores. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were $0.14, including a non-cash impairment charge of $0.02 per diluted share.
Store Openings
During the fiscal 2012 first quarter, the Company opened one new store, which is a relocation of an existing store that is expected to close in the second quarter, and ended the quarter with 407 stores in operation. During the fiscal 2012 second quarter, the Company anticipates opening three new stores, one of which is a relocation of an existing store that is
expected to close later in the year, and closing four stores, one of which relates to the relocation that occurred in the first quarter. For the fiscal 2012 full year, the Company currently anticipates opening approximately ten new stores, relocating approximately six stores and closing three stores. Of the six stores expected to be relocated in fiscal 2012, the Company anticipates closing approximately three stores this year and the remaining three stores in fiscal 2013.
Conference Call Information

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., July 31, 2012  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter and first six months ended July 1, 2012.
For the fiscal 2012 second quarter, net sales increased to $226.6 million from net sales of $219.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 1.0% for the second quarter of 2012 versus the comparable period in the prior year. As anticipated, second quarter sales were negatively affected by the calendar shift of the Fourth of July holiday further into the third quarter this year, which resulted in certain holiday-related sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2012 second quarter increased to $73.1 million from $71.8 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.2% in the fiscal 2012 second quarter versus 32.7% in the second quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin reflects higher store occupancy and distribution costs, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins of approximately 12 basis points. The improvement in merchandise margins was driven by a shift in the product sales mix and an adjustment in promotional activities, partially offset by the continuation of product cost inflation.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 30.3% in the fiscal 2012 second quarter from 30.5% in the second quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $1.8 million during the quarter from the prior year due primarily to higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count and increased employee benefit-related costs, as well as a pre-tax charge of $0.7 million related to store closing costs. These expenses were partially offset by lower advertising costs as well as lower debit card fees resulting from recent federal legislation. The Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.2 million related to certain underperforming stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $0.6 million in the same period last year.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $2.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, including $0.03 per diluted share of store closing and non-cash impairment charges. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, net income was $3.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $0.02 per diluted share.
For the 26-week period ended July 1, 2012, net sales increased to $445.1 million from net sales of $440.7 million in the 26 weeks ended July 3, 2011. Same store sales decreased 1.0% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2012 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $2.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, including $0.03 of store closing and impairment charges, for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2012, compared to net income of $5.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, including the $0.02 impairment charge, for the first half of last year.
"We are pleased to report that, despite continuing to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment, our business generated growth in same store sales and merchandise margins and achieved better than expected earnings for the second quarter," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This marked our first quarterly same store sales increase since the third quarter of 2010 and our first quarter of merchandise margin growth since the first quarter of 2011. We believe this positive trending reflects the growing impact of the merchandise and marketing initiatives that we have been implementing over the last several quarters. The improved performance was particularly evident with our softgoods products, as we experienced the strongest quarterly growth in both our apparel and footwear categories since 2006."
Mr. Miller continued, "Our positive momentum has continued in the third quarter and, as anticipated, sales in early July also benefited from the calendar shift of the Fourth of July holiday further into the third quarter this year. Looking forward, we plan to continue our efforts to broaden our appeal in today's consumer environment while providing the core value, quality and convenience that have been hallmarks of Big 5 for over 55 years."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on September 14, 2012 to stockholders of record as of August 31, 2012.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2012 second quarter, the Company repurchased 131,420 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $0.9 million. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company had approximately $10.9 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2012 third quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive low to mid-single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.28 to $0.34. This guidance includes an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, to provide for the closing of one underperforming store that had been expected to close in the second quarter. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $0.27.
Store Openings
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened three stores, one of which relates to a relocation, and closed three stores, one of which relates to a relocation.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., November 1, 2012  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2012 third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2012.
For the fiscal 2012 third quarter, net sales increased to $251.8 million from net sales of $234.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 5.2% for the third quarter of 2012 versus the comparable period in the prior year. As anticipated, third quarter sales reflect a modest benefit over the prior year from the calendar shift of the Fourth of July holiday, which resulted in certain holiday-related sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter for 2012.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2012 third quarter increased to $83.9 million from $77.0 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 33.3% in the fiscal 2012 third quarter versus 32.8% in the third quarter of the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin reflects an increase in merchandise margins of 25 basis points and the leveraging of store occupancy and distribution costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 27.9% in the fiscal 2012 third quarter from 28.8% in the third quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $2.9 million during the quarter from the prior year due primarily to higher store-related expenses reflecting an increased store count, increased employee benefit-related costs and a pre-tax charge of $0.4 million related to the closing of one store.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $8.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, including a store closing charge of $0.01 per diluted share, versus net income of $5.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
For the 39-week period ended September 30, 2012, net sales increased to $696.9 million from net sales of $675.4 million in the 39 weeks ended October 2, 2011. Same store sales increased 1.2% in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2012 versus the comparable period last year. Net income was $10.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, including $0.04 of store closing and non-cash impairment charges, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2012, compared to net income of $11.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, including a $0.02 non-cash impairment charge, for the comparable period last year.
"We are extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which built on the positive momentum in the second quarter and exceeded our earnings guidance," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We experienced improvement in both customer traffic and average sale, as well as expanded merchandise and operating margins. The strength of our performance was broad-based, as same store sales increased in each of our geographic regions and across all of our major product categories of apparel, footwear and hardgoods. We believe our business has continued to benefit from the merchandise and marketing initiatives that we have implemented over the last year. Additionally, our summer product sales benefited from relatively favorable weather compared to the prior year."
"We believe our third quarter results illustrate our ability to meaningfully leverage expenses and drive earnings growth as our sales improve," continued Mr. Miller. "Along with our strong sales and margin results, we reduced inventory levels per-store at quarter end by 3.7% versus the prior year. Our year-to-date operating cash flow at the end of the third quarter improved over $40 million compared to the prior year, and our debt levels declined by $16.5 million or 23.9% year over year."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We are encouraged that the positive sales trends have continued into the fourth quarter and are excited about our holiday product assortment and marketing plans. We remain focused on continuing to drive the business by broadening our appeal to include consumers with more discretionary income while maintaining our strong value proposition, and further leveraging our merchandise and operating improvements."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share of outstanding common stock, which will be paid on December 14, 2012 to stockholders of record as of November 30, 2012.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2012 third quarter, the Company repurchased 105,100 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $0.9 million. As of the end of the third quarter, the Company had approximately $10.0 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive mid-single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.13 to $0.21. For comparative purposes, the Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of $9,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $0.05 per diluted share.
Store Openings
During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened two stores and closed two stores, one of which relates to a relocation. The Company ended the fiscal 2012 third quarter with 407 stores in operation. During the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter, the Company currently anticipates opening eight new stores, including one relocation, and closing one store. For the fiscal 2012 full year, the Company currently anticipates opening fourteen new stores, including three relocations, and closing six stores, including two relocations.

EL SEGUNDO Calif., February 26, 2013  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2012.
,
As the Company previously reported, net sales for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter increased to $243.6 million from net sales of $226.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 6.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter increased to $78.4 million from $70.7 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.2% in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter versus 31.2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The improvement in gross profit margin reflects an increase in merchandise margins of approximately 20 basis points and lower store occupancy and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 29.2% in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter from 31.3% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $0.4 million for the quarter over the prior year due primarily to higher store-related expense reflecting an increased store count and increased employee benefit-related costs, partially offset by lower advertising expense. Selling and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of the prior year included a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $1.5 million.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $4.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of $9,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $0.05 per diluted share.
For the fiscal 2012 full year, net sales increased to $940.5 million from net sales of $902.1 million for fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 2.5% in fiscal 2012 from the prior year. Net income in fiscal 2012 was $14.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, including $0.04 of store closing and non-cash impairment charges, compared to net income in fiscal 2011 of $11.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, including non-cash impairment charges of $0.07 per diluted share.
"We are pleased to deliver a quarter of strong sales, expanded gross margins, expense leverage, meaningful earnings growth and very healthy cash flow," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As previously reported, our fourth quarter same store sales increase of 6.5% represented our largest quarterly same store sales increase in over ten years. Our sales comped positively in the mid-single-digit range for our October and November periods and comped positively in the high single-digit range for our December period. All three of our major merchandise categories comped positively for the quarter, with hardgoods being our strongest category followed by apparel and footwear. Our hardgoods category benefitted from the well-publicized national increase in demand for firearms and ammunition products. Despite the sales mix shift favoring these lower margin products, we expanded overall product selling margins for the quarter. We also are pleased to have further strengthened our balance sheet, as our operating cash flow for the year of $39.6 million allowed us to reduce borrowings under our credit facility by 25% to $47.5 million at year-end compared to the end of fiscal 2011, invest in new and relocated stores and return $10 million to shareholders through cash dividends and stock repurchases."
Mr. Miller continued, "We have continued to enjoy very healthy sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to date, as we have benefitted from favorable winter weather conditions in many of our markets and the continued increase in demand for firearms and ammunition products. Although our recent performance has been encouraging and we are pleased with the progress on our merchandise and marketing initiatives implemented over the last year, we recognize that the economy remains challenging for many, with ongoing pressures that could certainly impact consumer spending. We continue to focus our efforts on broadening our appeal to today's consumer and driving sales by offering an unmatched combination of value, selection and convenience."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has approved an increase of the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per share of outstanding common stock, for an annual rate of $0.40 per share. Previously, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.075 per share, for an annual rate of $0.30 per share. The quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of outstanding common stock will be paid on March 22, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2013.
Share Repurchases
During the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 40,000 shares of its common stock for a total expenditure of $0.4 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had approximately $9.6 million available for future stock repurchases under its $20.0 million share repurchase program authorized in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2013 first quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive high single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.18 to $0.24, including an anticipated tax benefit of $0.01 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the aforementioned increase in demand for firearms and ammunition products and favorable winter weather conditions compared to the prior year, partially offset by a negative impact from the calendar shift of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the second quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2013. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.01.
Store Openings
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened eight stores, including one relocation, and closed one store. The Company ended fiscal 2012 with 414 stores in operation. During the fiscal 2013 first quarter, the Company currently anticipates opening one new store and has closed one store as part of a relocation that began in fiscal 2012.

EL SEGUNDO Calif., April 30, 2013  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ: BGFV), a leading sporting goods retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2013 first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
,
For the fiscal 2013 first quarter, net sales increased to $246.3 million from net sales of $218.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Same store sales increased 10.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. As anticipated, first quarter sales were negatively affected by the calendar shift of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the second quarter and into the first quarter this year.
Gross profit for the fiscal 2013 first quarter increased to $80.5 million from $67.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The Company's gross profit margin was 32.7% in the fiscal 2013 first quarter versus 30.9% in the first quarter of the prior year. The improvement in gross profit margin reflects an increase in merchandise margins of 113 basis points and lower store occupancy and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales improved to 27.6% in the fiscal 2013 first quarter from 30.5% in the first quarter of the prior year. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $1.3 million for the quarter over the prior year due primarily to higher employee labor and benefit-related costs, higher credit card fees and higher operating costs to support an increase in store count, partially offset by lower advertising expense.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $7.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to net income of $156,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
"We are pleased to deliver a quarter of very strong earnings growth, driven by a double-digit increase in same store sales, improvements in customer traffic and average sale and expansion of merchandise and operating margins," said Steven G. Miller, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our operating results significantly exceeded the upper end of our guidance range issued in late February as a result of a stronger than anticipated performance during our March period. We believe these results for the quarter reflect the ongoing enhancements to our merchandise and marketing programs, the continued benefit from the national increase in demand for firearms and ammunition products and more favorable weather conditions in a majority of our markets versus the prior year. Our positive sales trends have continued into the second quarter and we feel well positioned to deliver strong results as we move through the spring and into the summer season."
Quarterly Cash Dividend
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per diluted share, which will be paid on June 14, 2013 to stockholders of record as of May 31, 2013.
Guidance
For the fiscal 2013 second quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the positive mid-single-digit range and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.20 to $0.26. This guidance reflects the benefit from the calendar shift of the Easter holiday, during which the Company's stores are closed, out of the second quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as increased expenses associated with the development of our e-commerce platform. For comparative purposes, the Company's earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.12, including $0.03 per diluted share of store closing and non-cash impairment charges.
Store Openings
During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company opened one new store and closed one store as part of a relocation that began in fiscal 2012, ending the quarter with 414 stores in operation. During the fiscal 2013 second quarter, the Company anticipates opening two new stores. For the fiscal 2013 full year, the Company currently anticipates opening approximately 15 to 20 net new stores.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today, April 30, 2013, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. EDT) to discuss financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. To access the conference call, participants in North America should dial (888) 505-4375,
