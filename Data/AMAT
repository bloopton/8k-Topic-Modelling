Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 31, 2003  Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the semiconductor industry, today announced that it expects its orders for the first fiscal quarter ending January 26, 2003 to be below the target provided during its fourth fiscal quarter earnings conference call on November 13, 2002.
 
First quarter orders are now expected to be approximately 35 percent below the fourth quarter level, compared with the previously announced target of 20 percent below the fourth quarter level. New orders for the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $1.56 billion.
 
"Due to ongoing economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties, customers deferred capital expenditures, causing a larger order shortfall than expected," said James C. Morgan, chairman and chief executive officer of Applied Materials.
 
The Company announced on its November 13, 2002 earnings conference call that its target for the first fiscal quarter of 2003 was for revenue to decrease at least 20 percent from fourth quarter results of $1.45 billion. The Company also announced on its November conference call that it expected to remain profitable operationally but would incur a small loss due to a restructuring charge associated with the reduction in force announced on November 4, 2002 and other costs. The pre-tax restructuring charge is now expected to be approximately $100 million.
 
Applied Materials will be discussing its first fiscal quarter results, along with its outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2003, on its regularly scheduled conference call on February 11, 2003, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available to all interested parties on Applied Materials' Web site at http://www.appliedmaterials.com under the "Investors" section.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those relating to first fiscal quarter orders, revenue, operating profitability and a restructuring charge. These forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: possible adjustments to financial results as Applied Materials closes its financial records for the first quarter, possible charges that might be taken to financial results for the first quarter, and possible changes in the size and components of the restructuring charge.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date:  March 17, 2003
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 17, 2003Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the semiconductor industry, announced today a major plan to align the Company's cost structure with current business conditions. The plan also provides for the infrastructure required to achieve the Company's growth potential when general economic conditions improve. The realignment plan has two major elements: first, restructuring actionsincluding consolidation of facilities and a reduction in work forcewhich will result in charges to income; and second, focused program management to provide additional cost savings. The plan is designed to enhance the Company's strong market position and add more value to customers' capability while reducing costs to enhance short-term and intermediate-term profit performance.
 
"The world is changing and the semiconductor industry is changing with it," said James C. Morgan, chairman and chief executive officer of Applied Materials. "Our customers are investing in advanced, complex technologies at the same time that they are under enormous pressure to reduce costs. The combination of changes in the industry and the extended downturn have led Applied Materials to take decisive action that will enable the Company to generate increased profits at current levels of revenue while maintaining strategic product development capability."
 
The Company expects to incur pretax restructuring charges of up to $425 million over the next four quarters, consisting primarily of up to $235 million for consolidation of facilities and related fixed assets and up to $120 million for employee severance and benefits associated with anticipated global work force reductions, and other charges. Facilities infrastructure is being reduced primarily through building consolidation in Santa Clara, California and Austin, Texas. The Company's facilities outside of the U.S. also will be reduced in various locations.
 
The realignment plan includes the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions or 14 percent of the Company's global work force. Approximately 1,400 positions in Applied Materials' North America operations will be affected and the majority of notifications will occur at the end of the second fiscal quarter. The remaining 600 positions will be eliminated at other locations worldwide by the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of FY03.
 
Additional savings are expected from focused program management and productivity initiatives that the Company has been implementing during the past two years. These actions and program savings are expected to reduce the Company's costs by approximately $60 million in the third fiscal quarter of FY03 to a target of approximately $100 million by the first fiscal quarter of FY04.
 
"We believe that the implementation of this plan will position Applied Materials to decisively respond to the fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry and enables us to improve profitability and extend our leadership," said Morgan. "This plan builds upon our global capabilities and reinforces Applied Materials' strong commitment to strategic investments, product and service excellence, productivity improvements and R&D programs that will drive our Company, customers and industry forward."
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to: those relating to the realignment plan and its elements; the realignment plan's timing and impact; the amount and timing of the restructuring charges; the amount and timing of the Company's cost savings; the Company's profitability and strategic position; and the semiconductor industry's outlook. These forward-looking statements include the assumptions that underlie such statements and are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to implement the realignment plan (including the consolidation of facilities and work force reduction) according to the timetable and to the extent currently anticipated; possible changes in the size and components of the restructuring charges and cost savings; the impact of the realignment plan on the Company's revenue and profitability; the Company's ability to maintain effective cost controls and to timely align its cost structure with market conditions; ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry; the length and severity of the economic and industry downturn; geopolitical uncertainties; and other risks described in Applied Materials' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company assumes no obligation to update the information in this press release.
 
Applied Materials will hold a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available at Applied Materials' Web site under the "Investors" section.

These measures are not in accordance with, or are an alternative for GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Pro forma net income is computed by adjusting GAAP net income with the impact of restructuring and realignment activities. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported results under GAAP to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to the press release.

Exhibit 99.1
Release: Immediate
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 13, 2003 -- Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the semiconductor industry, reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2003. Net sales were $1.11 billion, up five percent from $1.05 billion from the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and down four percent from $1.16 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. The net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was $62 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to a loss of $66 million, or $0.04 per share, for the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and down from net income of $52 million, or $0.03 per share reported for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. The initiation of the 2003 Realignment Plan (the "Plan") resulted in the reported net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2003.
Gross margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was 33.7 percent, down from 37.0 percent for the first fiscal quarter of 2003 and 40.0 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2002.
On March 17, 2003, Applied Materials announced the Plan to realign the company's infrastructure with current business conditions. The Plan consists of two major elements: first, restructuring actions (including consolidation of facilities and a reduction in work force); and second, refocused product development and cost reduction programs. Both parts of the Plan will result in charges to income across multiple categories, as incurred. During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the company began implementing the Plan, resulting in charges of $151.7 million. If the charges under the Plan had been excluded from the results reported above, the company would have reported gross margin of 38.1 percent and $44.8 million of net income or $0.03 per share on an ongoing basis.
New orders of $971 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 decreased four percent from $1.02 billion from the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and decreased 42 percent from $1.69 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. Regional distribution of new orders for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was: Japan 28 percent, Europe 25 percent, North America 23 percent, Korea 12 percent, Taiwan seven percent, and Southeast Asia and China five percent. Backlog at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003 decreased to $2.76 billion from $3.05 billion at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2003.
"We achieved our financial objectives for the second fiscal quarter despite challenging market conditions," said James C. Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials. "We believe that the Plan, which began during the quarter, will improve the company's cost structure and enable greater strategic focus on partnering with our customers to address their technology challenges as they move to 300mm wafers, smaller chip design geometries, and new materials.
"Semiconductor manufacturers remain cautious but continue to invest in advanced technologies, as they balance their need to develop the most advanced process capabilities with the uncertainties in the global economy and the impact of near-term weakness in chip demand. We believe that Applied Materials' strategic investment in product and service solutions, as well as our process integration expertise, strongly position the company for growth as the economy and capital spending levels improve.
"With the addition of Mike Splinter, as president and CEO, I am confident that our seasoned management team, together with our technological capabilities, global infrastructure and financial strength, uniquely position Applied Materials to rapidly respond to the opportunities ahead."
Reconciliations of reported results of operations under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to this press release. Due to the amount of costs incurred with realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that reconciliation to ongoing operations facilitates meaningful comparison with prior periods. To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP, the company uses a pro forma measure of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude costs of the Plan. The company believes that pro forma net income reports baseline performance before costs of the Plan. In addition, pro forma net income is the primary indicator management uses to plan and forecast future periods. These measures are not in accordance with, or are an alternative for GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Pro forma net income is computed by adjusting GAAP net income with the impact of restructuring and realignment activities. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those relating to the impact of the Plan, the company's strategic position and the semiconductor equipment and semiconductor industries' outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. Forward-looking statements may contain words such as "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "may," "should," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," or similar expressions, and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the company's ability to implement the Plan according to the timetable and to the extent anticipated; the impact of the Plan on the company's net sales and profitability; the company's ability to maintain effective cost controls and to timely align its cost structure with market conditions; the length and severity of the economic and industry downturn; changes in management; geopolitical uncertainties; changes in opportunities for growth; changes in demand for electronic products and semiconductors; customer capacity requirements, including capacity utilizing the latest technology; changes in the timing and amount of customers' capital spending for new technology; the company's ability to develop, deliver and support a broad range of products and services on a timely basis; the company's successful and timely development of new markets, products, processes and services and other risks described in Applied Materials' Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 12, 2003  Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the semiconductor industry, reported results for its third fiscal quarter ended July 27, 2003. Net sales were $1.09 billion, down one percent from $1.11 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2003, and down 25 percent from $1.46 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2002. Gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2003 was 31.7 percent, down from 33.7 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 and 41.5 percent for the third fiscal quarter of 2002. The net loss for the third fiscal quarter of 2003 was $37 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a loss of $62 million, or $0.04 per share, for the second fiscal quarter of 2003, and down from net income of $115 million, or $0.07 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2002.
     A pre-tax realignment charge of $164 million, or $0.07 per share, resulted in the net loss for the third fiscal quarter of 2003. Realignment activities consisted of inventory write-offs as a result of the implementation of the global spares distribution system, refocused product efforts (which included the Etec mask pattern products), a reduction in the workforce and the consolidation of facilities. Excluding the charges associated with realignment activities, the company would have reported ongoing gross margin of 40.2 percent for the third fiscal quarter, an increase from 38.1 percent for the second fiscal quarter, and ongoing net income of $78 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third fiscal quarter, an increase from $45 million, or $0.03 per share, for the second fiscal quarter.
     New orders of $1.05 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2003 increased nine percent from $971 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2003, and decreased 41 percent from $1.78 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2002. Regional distribution of new orders for the third fiscal quarter of 2003 was: Taiwan 36 percent, North America 20 percent, Japan 18 percent, Korea 10 percent, Europe 10 percent, and Southeast Asia and China six percent. Backlog at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2003 decreased to $2.53 billion from $2.76 billion at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003.
     "We are pleased with our financial performance this quarter, particularly the increase in new orders as we focus the company on renewed growth," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "These results reflect Applied Materials' technology and market leadership, customer focus and improved cost structure.
 
     "Although semiconductor manufacturers continue to be cautious in their capital spending, we see positive indicators emerging. An improved global economy and higher fab utilization are giving customers the confidence to gradually invest in new technology for the transition to advanced chip designs and 300mm wafer production."
     In the quarter, Applied Materials extended its leadership in 300mm technologies for 90nm and below devices with eight new products for copper interconnect and transistor applications, including advanced systems for etch, decoupled plasma nitridation, electrochemical plating, wafer inspection, epitaxy, and chemical mechanical polishing. In addition, Applied Materials' Black Diamond CVD film became the first low-k solution to reach volume production in multiple manufacturing sites.
     "My first 90 days at Applied Materials have reinforced my belief in its great people, outstanding product portfolio, strong financial management and commitment to our customers. Our entire organization is focused on delivering the next generation technologies that our customers need. Applied Materials is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities ahead," concluded Splinter.
     Reconciliations of reported results of operations under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to this press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred with realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that reconciliation to ongoing operations facilitates meaningful comparison with prior periods. To supplement the consolidated condensed financial statements prepared under GAAP, the company uses a pro forma measure of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude costs associated with realignment activities. The company believes that pro forma net income reports baseline performance before charges associated with realignment activities. In addition, pro forma net income is the primary indicator management uses to plan and forecast future periods. These measures are not in accordance with, or are an alternative for, GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 18, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied Materials") announced its financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended February 1, 2004. A copy of Applied Materials' press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied Materials, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Applied Materials uses a pro forma measure, or a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude costs associated with realignment activities. Due to the amount of costs incurred with realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that the use of a pro forma measure facilitates meaningful comparison with prior periods. Applied Materials believes that pro forma net income reports baseline performance before costs associated with realignment activities. In addition, pro forma net income is the primary indicator management uses to plan and forecast future periods. These measures are neither in accordance with, nor an alternative for, GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported results under GAAP to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to the press release.

The company reported a pre-tax realignment charge of $167 million, or $0.07 per share after tax, for the first fiscal quarter of 2004. Realignment activities consisted primarily of consolidation of facilities. Excluding the charges associated with realignment activities, the company would have reported ongoing net income of $200 million, or $0.12 per share, for the first fiscal quarter of 2004, an increase from $95 million, or $0.06 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. New orders of $1.68 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2004 increased 32 percent from $1.28 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003, and increased 66 percent from $1.02 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2003.

"We are pleased with our revenue and order growth trends," said Mike Splinter, president and chief executive officer of Applied Materials. "Semiconductor unit demand remained robust throughout the quarter, driven by higher consumer electronics and business IT spending. Based on these industry drivers, our customers have announced increased capital spending plans for 2004. With our technological leadership, global customer support capabilities and financial strength, Applied Materials is well positioned to support our customers as they move into the nanometer era of chip manufacturing."
Applied Materials, Inc. February 18, 2004 Page 2 of 7 Applied Materials continues to demonstrate its leadership by delivering critical technologies that enable our customers to manufacture their most advanced designs.

Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On June 15, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied Materials or the Company) dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PricewaterhouseCoopers) as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. On June 16, 2004, the Audit Committee engaged KPMG LLP (KPMG) as its new independent registered public accounting firm.
(a) Former independent registered public accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers' reports on the consolidated financial statements of Applied Materials for the past two fiscal years contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. In connection with its audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended October 27, 2002 and October 26, 2003 and through June 15, 2004, there were no disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers, would have caused PricewaterhouseCoopers to make reference thereto in its reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years. During Applied Materials' fiscal years ended October 27, 2002 and October 26, 2003 and through June 15, 2004, there were no "reportable events," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Applied Materials has provided PricewaterhouseCoopers with a copy of the statements made in this Form 8-K and has requested that PricewaterhouseCoopers furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PricewaterhouseCoopers agrees with these statements. A copy of PricewaterhouseCoopers' letter dated June 16, 2004 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
(b) New independent registered public accounting firm
During the two most recent fiscal years and through June 15, 2004, neither Applied Materials nor anyone on its behalf consulted KPMG regarding either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Applied Materials' consolidated financial statements, nor has KPMG provided to Applied Materials a written report or oral advice regarding such principles or audit opinion.

The acquisition will expand Applied Materials' current portfolio of service products to support chip manufacturers worldwide and will provide important synergies that leverage the operational, financial and logistical strengths of the two companies.
 
Under terms of the agreement, Applied Materials will pay approximately $85 million for all outstanding shares and equity equivalents of Metron's worldwide operating subsidiaries and substantially all of its other assets, and will assume certain Metron liabilities. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory and Metron shareholder approval and other closing conditions, is expected to close in Applied Materials' fourth fiscal quarter.
 
Metron Technology is a global organization with over 30 offices and several operating facilities in the U.S., Europe, Israel and Asia. Metron's outsource solutions to fabs worldwide include supply of parts and materials, equipment maintenance, kitting and cleaning of process parts, refurbishment of legacy equipment, and distribution of specialty products.
 
"The acquisition of Metron is another significant step in the expansion of our service solutions that we offer to customers, and a key element of Applied Materials' growth," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "Complementing our recent transactions with Brooks Automation, Praxair Electronics and Phoenix Silicon International, this acquisition represents an important milestone in an ongoing series of strategic moves to service a larger market and expand our support capabilities beyond Applied Materials' tools."
 
"Combining Metron's experienced service-oriented organization with Applied Materials' strong service offerings and global reach brings additional, world-class capabilities to customers and demonstrates our strong commitment to enabling their success," added Russell Ellwanger, group vice president and general manager of Applied Global Services.
 
The Metron businesses will be an integral part of Applied Global Services and will develop and market products for Applied Materials' growing fab services program, including support of non-Applied Materials systems.

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On August 17, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied Materials") announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended August 1, 2004. A copy of Applied Materials' press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied Materials, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the consolidated condensed financial statements prepared under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Applied Materials uses a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude special items. Reconciliations of reported results of operations under GAAP to ongoing results have been included as a supplement to the press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in prior periods as a result of realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that ongoing results are useful to investors because they reflect baseline performance exclusive of charges associated with realignment activities. Ongoing results are the primary indicator used by Applied Materials' management to plan and forecast future periods. These non-GAAP measures are neither in accordance with, nor an alternative for, GAAP, and may be materially different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On September 2, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") received notice that the arbitration panel in the second phase of the arbitration between Applied and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("VSEA") (previously disclosed in Applied's SEC filings) found that Applied had not proven the invalidity of certain patent claims asserted by VSEA under a patent license agreement between Applied and VSEA dated January 1, 1992 (the "Agreement"). The parties have until October 1, 2004 to notify the panel whether or not a hearing on the amount of royalty payments owed by Applied to VSEA under the Agreement is necessary. Based on Applied's current assessment of this matter, Applied expects that the amount of back royalty payments owed will not exceed $30 million. In addition to back royalty payments, Applied will be required to make unit-based royalty payments on future sales of certain products found to be within the scope of the Agreement. Applied expects that these unit-based royalty payments will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. For additional information concerning this arbitration, please refer to the "Legal Proceedings" section of Applied's most recent SEC reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.
 
Forward-looking statements
 
This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements relating to the amounts of back royalty payments and unit-based royalty payments that Applied will be required to make and their impact on Applied's financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such words as "expects" and "will," are based on management's assessments as of the date hereof, and include the assumptions that underlie such assessments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Applied's accurate assessment of the amounts of back royalty payments and unit-based royalty payments and their impact on Applied's financial condition and results of operations.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 17, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied Materials) amended both its U.S. $250,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) and its U.S. $250,000,000 Three-Year Credit Agreement (Three-Year Credit Agreement). These two amendments were entered into among Applied Materials, Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent, and Citicorp USA, Inc., KeyBank National Association, BNP Paribas, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Bank of America, N.A., Mellon Bank, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and HSBC Bank USA, as lenders.
 
Amendment No. 1 to the 364-Day Credit Agreement extends the 364-Day Credit Agreement until September 16, 2005, removes a financial covenant limiting the amount of Applied Materials' consolidated debt and eliminates the requirement of Applied Materials to make representations that there are no material adverse changes as a condition precedent to each advance.
 
Amendment No. 1 to the Three-Year Credit Agreement removes a financial covenant limiting the amount of Applied Materials' consolidated debt and eliminates the requirement of Applied Materials to make representations that there are no material adverse changes as a condition precedent to each advance.
 
The interest rates for any advances made pursuant to the amended credit agreements will fluctuate based in part on Applied Materials' long-term senior unsecured credit ratings. The amended credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on certain liens, restrictions on certain transactions and requirements for certain consolidated tangible net worth. A default under the amended credit agreements may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants, a failure to pay material debt obligations in excess of $75 million and any acceleration of such obligations. A default under the amended credit agreements would permit the participating banks to restrict Applied Materials' ability to further access the credit facility for advances and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances and interest thereon.
 
Other than the amended credit agreements themselves, there is no material relationship between Applied Materials and the other parties to the amendments to the credit agreements. From time to time, Applied Materials conducts other banking business with Citibank and some of the other lenders.
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
As discussed under Item 1.01 above, on September 17, 2004, Applied Materials amended two credit agreements. Applied Materials has not received any advances under these amended credit agreements as of this time.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 20, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into a Binding Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") with Novellus Systems, Inc. ("Novellus"). The MOU effects a full settlement of lawsuits for patent infringement pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case Nos. C-97-20523-RMW and C-97-20551-RMW, without either party admitting any liability. The MOU provides for Applied to pay $8 million to Novellus by September 24, 2004, and to waive approximately $3.5 million that Applied claimed was owed under a 1997 settlement agreement between the parties. In addition, patent licenses previously granted by each of Novellus and Applied in the prior settlement agreement become fully paid up, as well as revocable only in limited circumstances.
 
The MOU contains additional covenants and restrictions, which in general establish a structure that is expected to help avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future. The MOU limits the ability of each party (including subsidiaries and permitted successors and assigns) to sue the other, and the other's customers and (with some exceptions) suppliers and distributors, for infringement of any of the parties' respective patents covering products in technology areas in which both parties engaged in business as of September 3, 2004 (the "effective date"), as follows: (i) for a period of five years from the effective date of the MOU as to existing products, and (ii) for a period of two years from the effective date (with the possibility to extend for an additional year) as to new products introduced after the effective date (the "covenants not to sue"). The following technology areas are expressly covered by the covenants not to sue: integrated anneal, CVD (chemical vapor deposition), PVD (physical vapor deposition), PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), HDP-PECVD (high density plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, ALD (atomic layer deposition), ECD (electrochemical deposition) and, with some exceptions, CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Technology areas in which neither party or only one party engaged in business as of the effective date are specifically excluded from the covenants not to sue (the "excluded product areas"), including stand-alone wet-clean, ion implant, flat panel display processes and production equipment, stand-alone metrology and optical or e-beam inspection of wafers or masks, mask writing, photoresist strip, etch, epitaxial deposition, and RTP (rapid thermal processing).
 
The parties further agreed to notice and cure periods prior to filing suit on products subject to a covenant not to sue that has expired. No damages for infringement will accrue during the covenant not to sue and cure periods. The MOU permits each party to continue to provide support (including certain replacement parts and consumables) to customers for products (other than those in excluded product areas) sold during any covenant not to sue or cure period. The MOU contains other conditions pertaining to, and requiring binding arbitration of, claims regarding certain consumables and replacement parts (other than those in excluded product areas). The MOU does not confer any rights or benefits upon any person or entity not a party to the MOU.
 
The MOU contains a general release of all claims arising prior to the effective date that either Applied or Novellus may have had against the other and the other's customers and (with some exceptions) suppliers and distributors, relating to infringement of the party's patents by any of the other party's products (other than those in excluded product areas). Trial on the liability portion of Novellus' lawsuit had been scheduled to begin on September 20, 2004. For additional information regarding the history of these lawsuits,
please refer to the "Legal Proceedings" section of Applied's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.
 
General
 
The MOU is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.38 and is incorporated herein by this reference. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the MOU. Any information disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or the exhibits hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material.
 
Forward-looking statements
 
This report contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the avoidance of future patent infringement lawsuits and other effects of the MOU. These forward-looking statements can be identified by use of such words as "expect," are based on management's assessments as of the date hereof, and include the assumptions that underlie such assessments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These risks include changes in each party's competitive position, changes in the semiconductor equipment industry, as well as other risks described in the "Trends, Risks and Uncertainties" section of Applied's SEC reports. Applied undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K.

Party
Parties"
 
B. The Parties intend to enter into a definitive agreement implementing this MOU (the "") as soon as practicable, and no later than the close of business on September 24, 2004, unless an extension is agreed to by both Parties in writing, with the understanding that if a Definitive Agreement is not entered into by that date, this MOU shall be and remain legally binding between the Parties. If a Definitive Agreement is reached, it shall extinguish and supersede this MOU.
Definitive Agreement
 
Accordingly, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this MOU as of the Effective Date.
 
 
 
 
 
Section 1.
 
(a) No Party may assign any of its rights under this MOU, or delegate any performance of its obligations under this MOU, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which it may give or withhold in its sole discretion (subject to the balance of this Section 1). All assignments of rights and delegations of obligations are prohibited under this subsection, whether they are voluntary or involuntary, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law or any other manner. For purposes of this Section 1, a "change of control" (as defined below) is deemed an assignment of rights and a delegation of performance of obligations, and a "merger" refers to any merger in which a Party participates, whether or not it is the surviving or disappearing corporation. Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance in violation of this Section 1 is void.
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 1(a), either Party hereto may assign its rights and delegate its performance of obligations under this MOU, without the prior written consent of the other Party, if such Party experiences a "change of control" (as hereinafter defined) and the other conditions set forth in this Section 1 are fulfilled. For purposes of this MOU, a change of control of a Party shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as: (i) any person or entity (or "group" of persons or entities, as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired (whether by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other corporate transaction, purchase or in any other manner) beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13(d)-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of securities of the applicable Party (or other securities convertible into such securities) representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of all outstanding securities of such Party entitled to vote in the election of directors; or (ii) any person or entity (or "group" of persons or entities, as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired all or substantially all of the assets of a Party.
 
(c) The "other conditions" referred to in Section 1(b) above are that: (a) the acquiring person, entity or group in the change of control (the "") expressly agrees in writing to be bound by each and every term and condition of this MOU, and be liable for each and every liability and obligation of the acquired Party hereunder, and (b) the Acquiror provides written notice to the other Party of the fact of the acquisition and the identity of the Acquiror within five (5) business days of the closing of any such change of control. If an assignment of rights is permitted and occurs pursuant to this Section 1, a contemporaneous delegation is deemed to have occurred and the assignee is deemed to have assumed the assignor's performance obligations in favor of the nonassigning party, but without releasing the assigning party of any obligations or liabilities hereunder.
Acquiror
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations set forth in this MOU will not be assignable by either Party as a debtor-in-possession, or by a bankruptcy trustee or receiver, to any third party in connection with any proceeding under applicable bankruptcy law.
 
(e) Assuming the "other conditions" referred to above are complied with, if, in addition, an Acquiror expressly agrees in a writing delivered to all Parties prior to the consummation of the change of control that that the definition of the term "Patents" in this MOU shall include all of the Acquiror's and its Subsidiaries' existing and future Patents (a ""), then, upon the consummation of the change of control, the Acquiror shall be entitled to assert the protections of this MOU, subject to all limitations herein, as if it were the Party being acquired, other than Paragraph 5 ("5-Year Covenant Not to Sue For Existing Products") and any associated Cure Period provisions, it being understood that the products, processes, Consumables, or tools (and features incorporated in the foregoing) of the Acquiror shall, in this case, be deemed New Products. For example, in such case all of the Acquiror's products shall be protected as if they were a Party's New Products, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations herein. If the Acquiror does not give a Patent Undertaking, then, assuming the "other conditions" referred to above are complied with, upon the consummation of the change of control, the definition of the terms "Patents", "Existing Products" and "New Products" shall thereafter be deemed to include solely those Patents, Existing Products and New Products which, immediately prior to the change of control, the Party acquired by the Acquiror would then properly be bound by or could properly assert. For example, although the Acquiror will be able to assert the benefits of this MOU as to the Existing Products and New Products of the Party that it acquired, as they existed immediately prior to the change of control, it shall not be entitled to assert this MOU as to its own products; nor will it be obligated to observe the restrictions herein as to its own Patents; , , that to the extent either Existing Products or New Products of the Party acquired, as they existed immediately prior to the change of control, are re-sold, without substantial modification, by the Acquiror (regardless of the name under which they are sold), or are included, without substantial modification, into a product suite of the Acquiror, then such Existing Products and New Products shall continue to be entitled to the protections of this MOU. Nothing in this Section 1(e) shall affect any disputes or legal actions in effect by a Party against an Acquiror prior to the date of the change of control.
Patent Undertaking

Section 2. The Parties, and each of them, represent and warrant to the other that: they have the corporate power and authority to enter into this MOU; this MOU has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Party, including the releases and covenants contained herein, and that they and their counsel have the authority to execute and file the stipulated dismissal referred to in Paragraph 2 of this MOU; that the execution, delivery and performance of this MOU does not and will not violate or breach (a) the article of incorporation or bylaws of such Party, or (b) any contract, agreement, judgment, order or decree applicable to, or which binds, such Party; that this MOU constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of each of them, enforceable in accordance with its terms this MOU shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees,
 
agents, attorneys, legal representatives, and (to the extent permitted by Section 1) successors, and assigns; they have not transferred or assigned or purported to transfer or assign any of the claims, causes of action, demands, costs, obligations, damages, or liabilities being released under this MOU, and each party agrees to indemnify the other from and against any claim based upon, connected with, or arising out of any such assignment or transfer or purported assignment or transfer.
 
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms and provisions of this MOU and the negotiations and communications leading to it are confidential and shall not be disclosed by any Party to anyone other than counsel for such Party. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party may (a) disclose to third parties only the fact that the Parties have settled and dismissed the above-referenced litigations with prejudice and that each Party is to bear its own costs and fees; (b) disclose this MOU and its terms to a third party in connection with a financing, merger or acquisition, or stock offering; provided, that, except for portions of this MOU that have been disclosed publicly in compliance with this Section 3, the Party seeking to disclose this MOU shall use [****] MOU in connection with such transaction to agree to a confidentiality agreement covering this MOU [****], it being understood that [****] regarding any disclosure pursuant to this clause (b) or to provide copies of a confidentiality agreement referred to herein, if one is entered into, nor will the [****] for failure to obtain the aforementioned confidentiality agreement; (c) make such disclosures of this MOU and its terms as are mutually agreed upon by all Parties in writing; (d) make such disclosure of this MOU and its terms as are required under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations; (e) issue a press release in form and substance agreeable to them mutually; and (f) make such other disclosure of the MOU and its terms as are required by law, that (A) with respect to clause (d), it is understood that each Party [****] and that each Party shall [****] provided by the other Party [****], including [****] regarding the content of the disclosure required and whether [****], it being understood that neither Party is [****], and (B) respect solely to this clause (f), the Party required to make the disclosure shall notify all other Party at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any such disclosure, shall allow the other Party to intervene in any proceeding (at such other Parties' own cost and expense, in a reasonable manner, and in consultation with all Parties hereto) to protect the confidentiality of this MOU and its terms, and shall undertake reasonable efforts ([****] that would reasonably result in [****]) to require the continued confidentiality of this MOU and its terms (for example, by requesting that [****]). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all portions of this MOU that have been publicly disclosed in compliance with this Section 3 shall no longer be subject to the limitations on disclosure in this Section 3.
provided
 
 
Section 4. This MOU and the dismissals, as well as the fact that the Parties have entered into this MOU and the dismissals, shall not be admissible against either Party for any purpose in any future litigation between the Parties except to enforce the terms of the MOU. Nothing herein shall be construed as an admission of liability on the part of any Party hereto. In addition, neither Party shall assert that compliance with this MOU or any Definitive Agreement supports in any way a defense of estoppel, laches, or similar defenses; , , that nothing herein shall be deemed to toll any Patent statute of limitations that is otherwise applicable. Any determination of as to Infringement, validity or enforceability of a Patent pursuant to the royalty arbitration provided for in Paragraph 9 of this MOU, and any royalties paid pursuant thereto, shall not have legal effect (whether by way of claim or issue preclusion or otherwise) in any court proceeding that may arise in connection with the Patents at issue in the arbitration.

The parties hereto consent to the jurisdiction of said court, as applicable, and to service of process outside of the State of California pursuant to the requirement of such court in any matter subject to it. This MOU shall be deemed to have been entered into in the State of California and shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreement executed and to be performed therein by each party (and without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions of such state).

Exhibit 99.1
 
Release:  Immediate
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., September 24, 2004  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Novellus Systems, Inc. to dismiss all pending lawsuits between the companies involving allegations of patent infringement and to establish a structure that is expected to help avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future.
 
"This agreement produces a positive result for both companies and demonstrates strong motivation not to infringe each other's patents," said Joseph J. Sweeney, Group Vice President, Legal Affairs and Intellectual Property, and Corporate Secretary. "By putting these legal matters behind us, Applied Materials is able to better focus on customer requirements and to compete in the market based on the merits of our products and technology."
 
The agreement provides for a payment to Novellus of $8 million and waives a claim for unpaid royalties of approximately $3.5 million. The agreement also contains provisions limiting for specified time periods each party's ability to sue each other (and each other's customers and, in certain circumstances, suppliers and distributors) for infringement of their respective patents covering products in certain technology areas. For existing products, the specified time period is five years, and for new products, it is two years. There is no new license of technology in the agreement. The agreement ends all pending lawsuits between the companies without either party admitting any liability. Additional details of the agreement are disclosed in Applied Materials' Form 8-K filed today.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the avoidance of future patent infringement lawsuits and other effects of the agreement. These forward-looking statements can be identified by use of such words as "expect," are based on management's assessments as of the date hereof, and include the assumptions that underlie such assessments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These risks include changes in each party's competitive position, changes in the semiconductor equipment industry, as well as other risks described in the "Trends, Risks and Uncertainties" section of Applied's SEC reports. Applied undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this press release.

PRESS RELEASE
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., October 25, 2004  Applied Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMAT) announced today that Nancy H. Handel, group vice president, has been named chief financial officer, effective immediately. Joseph R. Bronson, former CFO, resigned from the company effective October 22, 2004 to pursue other interests.
 
Handel, a 19-year veteran of Applied Materials, held the post of deputy chief financial officer, corporate controller and principal accounting officer for the past four years. In this position, she was responsible for external reporting and operations finance, including product groups and regions worldwide. During her tenure she has performed a variety of key financial executive roles for Applied Materials, including 13 years as treasurer. Most recently, she was instrumental in driving the successful restructuring of the company, which delivered substantial operational returns.
 
"Nancy has the capability and experience to be an outstanding CFO," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "Her contributions have been vital to growing Applied into an industry leader."
 
Prior to joining Applied Materials, Handel held treasury and financial management positions at Raychem Corporation, Crown Zellerbach and The Aviation Group. She has a B.S. degree in Economics from Purdue University, an M.B.A. from The Ohio State University and is a graduate of the Stanford Executive Program. Active in the community, Handel served on the Board of Directors for the Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County from 1991 to 2004, including the last six years as board president. She also is a member of the Advisory Board of Community Foundation Silicon Valley and served as a member of the Alumni Board of Directors of the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University. She is a member of the Women of Silicon Valley Advisory Council.
 
"We are grateful to Joe for his many accomplishments and contributions over the last 20 years," Splinter said. "We wish him well in his future endeavors."
 
Bronson's resignation was not related to the company's financial condition, financial statement disclosures or accounting practices.
 
Applied Materials will discuss this management change in a brief conference call today beginning at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Time. The call will be webcast on Applied Materials' Web site (www.appliedmaterials.com) under the "Investors" section.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 17, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied Materials") announced its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. A copy of Applied Materials' press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied Materials, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference in such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the consolidated condensed financial statements prepared under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Applied Materials uses a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude special items. Reconciliations of reported results of operations under GAAP to ongoing results are included as a supplement to the press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in prior periods as a result of realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that ongoing results are useful to investors because they reflect baseline performance exclusive of charges associated with realignment activities. Ongoing results are the primary indicator used by Applied Materials' management to plan and forecast future periods.

Exhibit 99.1 Release: Immediate Contact: Paul Bowman (investment community) David Miller (editorial/media) (408)563-1698 (408)563-9582 APPLIED MATERIALS ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER 2004 New Orders of $2.62 Billion; Net Sales of $2.20 Billion SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 17, 2004 -- Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the global semiconductor industry, reported results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2004. Net sales were $2.20 billion, down 1 percent from $2.24 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up 80 percent from $1.22 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Gross margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was 46.6 percent, down from 47.4 percent for the third fiscal quarter of 2004 and up from 40.5 percent for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Net income for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was $455 million, or $0.27 per share, up from net income of $441 million, or $0.26 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up from net income of $15 million, or $0.01 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. The results of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 include litigation settlements and a favorable tax rate adjustment due primarily to changes in export tax benefits and the global effective tax rate with respect to foreign operations. The company's ongoing net income was $455 million, or $0.27 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, up from $441 million, or $0.26 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up from $95 million, or $0.06 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Ongoing results for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 were the same as reported net income. New orders of $2.62 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 increased 7 percent from $2.46 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and increased 105 percent from $1.28 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Regional distribution of new orders for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was: Taiwan 25 percent, Japan 20 percent, North America 17 percent, Korea 16 percent, Southeast Asia and China 11 percent, and Europe 11 percent. Backlog at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was $3.37 billion, compared to $2.99 billion at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2004. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, the company repurchased 31 million shares of common stock at an average price of $16.13 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. "We are pleased with our financial performance this quarter and our strong growth for this fiscal year," said Mike Splinter, president and chief executive officer. "Our team delivered solid results with increased orders driven by customer demand for our industry-leading 300mm and sub-100 nanometer products." -more-
Applied Materials, Inc. November 17, 2004 Page 2 of 7 The company also announced its results for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. Fiscal 2004 new orders were $8.98 billion, a 108 percent increase from fiscal 2003 new orders of $4.32 billion. Net sales for fiscal 2004 were $8.01 billion, a 79 percent increase from fiscal 2003 net sales of $4.48 billion. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $1.35 billion, or $0.78 per diluted share, up from a loss of $149 million, or $0.09 loss per share, for fiscal 2003. "We introduced 10 breakthrough products in critical technology areas for transistors, interconnects, defect review and flat panel displays, as well as new service products," Splinter continued. "Applied Materials increased its market share in a number of its core product areas and won customer awards for outstanding reliability and quality. "As the fourth quarter progressed, some customers became more cautious in response to inventory concerns, slowing their 200mm investments," said Splinter. "Even with these near-term market challenges, we believe our customers will continue to invest in advanced technology and 300mm manufacturing. We remain focused on translating our proven product and process expertise into cost-effective, innovative solutions for our customers," concluded Splinter. Reconciliations of reported results of operations under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to ongoing results are included as a supplement to this press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in prior periods as a result of realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that ongoing results are useful to investors because they reflect baseline performance exclusive of charges associated with realignment activities. Ongoing results are the primary indicator used by Applied Materials' management to plan and forecast future periods.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 7, 2004, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved (1) performance goals and a bonus formula for fiscal year 2005 under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), and (2) an increase in the annual retainer for the Board member serving as lead independent director.
 
As set forth in the Plan, which was approved by Applied's stockholders at the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Committee may choose from a range of defined performance measures. For fiscal year 2005, the Committee approved two equally-weighted performance measures for Michael R. Splinter, President and Chief Executive Officer, and for Nancy H. Handel, Group Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. These goals relate to the achievement of certain levels of annual revenue and net income by Applied. For Franz Janker, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing, the Committee approved several differently-weighted measures. Specifically, Mr. Janker's goals under the Plan for fiscal year 2005 relate to the achievement of certain levels of: annual revenue by Applied and by certain business units (weighted 35%); earnings per share (weighted 10%); and other management by objectives related primarily to customer satisfaction, productivity and cost reduction (weighted 55%). These goals are measured against actual performance, and the result is multiplied by an additional earnings-per-share factor.
 
The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2005 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Committee. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the bonus that otherwise would be payable based on actual performance. In no event may any individual's bonus under the Plan for fiscal year 2005 exceed $5 million. Moreover, each of the individuals named above must remain an employee for all of fiscal year 2005 in order to be eligible for any bonus.
 
The Committee also approved a change in the annual cash retainer for the Board's lead independent director. Effective for fiscal year 2005, the annual retainer for the lead independent director (currently Herbert M. Dwight, Jr.) will be $30,000 per year. No other changes were made in Board compensation. The annual retainer for the director who is chair of the Committee remains $25,000 and the annual retainer for the chair of the Audit Committee of the Board remains $30,000. The retainer for all other directors remains unchanged at $20,000 per year. Directors who are employees of Applied do not receive any additional compensation for their services as directors.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 22, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved the Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide nonemployee members of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Board") with a convenient method by which they may purchase shares of Applied's common stock (the "Shares"). Directors will pay 100% of fair market value for any Shares they purchase.
 
The Plan provides that, at least once annually, each nonemployee director will be given the opportunity to voluntarily elect to receive Shares in lieu of retainer fees and/or meeting fees that otherwise would be payable to them in cash for their service on the Board. Elections relate to fees that have not yet been earned by the director. Once the annual election is made, such election may not be changed or revoked for that year. Any fees that the participating director chooses to forego under the Plan will be converted into Shares based on the fair market value of a Share on the date of the Board or committee meeting for which the participating directors otherwise would be paid (or on the final day of a meeting that takes place over multiple days). Quarterly retainer fees will be converted into Shares based on the fair market value of a Share on the date of the regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting of the Board. However, for the first quarter in which the Plan is in effect (the second fiscal quarter of Applied's 2005 fiscal year), foregone fees will be converted into Shares based on the fair market value of a Share on April 8, 2005. Shares payable under the Plan will be fully vested and taxable.

On March 18, 2005, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") notified participants in the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan") that a blackout period under the 401(k) Plan would be in effect beginning as of the close of the market on April 18, 2005, and ending during the week of April 24, 2005 (the "401(k) blackout period").
 
The notice to 401(k) Plan participants provided that the Applied Materials, Inc. Common Stock Fund (the "Applied Stock Fund") under the 401(k) Plan would be converting to real-time trading for purchases and sales and that the reason for the 401(k) blackout period was to allow sufficient time for the 401(k) Plan's trustee/recordkeeper to make this conversion to real-time trading. 401(k) Plan participants were advised to contact Fidelity Investments at 1-800-835-5098 to obtain the specific ending date of the 401(k) blackout period. During the 401(k) blackout period, participants will be unable to exchange their 401(k) Plan account balances into or out of the Applied Stock Fund, change their future contributions directed to the Applied Stock Fund, or request new loans or distributions from the Applied Stock Fund.
 
In addition to the notice to 401(k) Plan participants, on April 1, 2005, Applied gave written notice to all members of its Board of Directors and all executive officers pursuant to Section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC Regulation BTR promulgated thereunder. The notice advised that Applied's directors and executive officers are subject to special trading restrictions that, in general, prevent them from selling, purchasing or otherwise acquiring any shares of Applied common stock during the 401(k) blackout period, subject to certain exceptions. A copy of this notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
During the 401(k) blackout period and for a period of two years after the ending date of the 401(k) blackout period, security holders or other interested persons may obtain, without charge, information about the actual beginning and ending dates of the 401(k) blackout period by contacting Charmaine Mesina, Managing Director, Corporate Legal Services, in writing, at Applied Materials, Inc., 3050 Bowers Avenue, P.O.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Please be advised that you will be subject to special trading restrictions beginning at the close of the market on Monday, April 18, 2005, and ending during the week of April 24, 2005. During this period (the "401(k) blackout period"), a blackout will be imposed affecting participants in the Applied Materials' Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), in order to enable the Applied Materials Common Stock Fund (the "Applied Stock Fund") under the 401(k) Plan to be converted to real-time trading for purchases and sales. During the 401(k) blackout period, 401(k) Plan participants will be unable to transfer their account balances into or out of the Applied Stock Fund, change their future contributions directed to the Applied Stock Fund, or request new loans or distributions from the Applied Stock Fund. As a result, in general, you may not purchase, sell or otherwise acquire shares of Applied Materials common stock during the 401(k) blackout period, as specified under SEC Regulation BTR adopted pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The rule applies to board members and executive officers of public companies and was designed to eliminate the inequities that may result when participants in such companies' pension plans are temporarily prevented from engaging in equity securities transactions through their plan accounts.
any
 
The specific ending date of the 401(k) blackout period will be determined by Fidelity Investments ("Fidelity") and may be confirmed by contacting Fidelity at 1-800-835-5098. The 401(k) blackout period will fall within the Q2'05 regular quarterly blackout, which begins on April 11, 2005 and ends on May 20, 2005, following Applied Materials' earnings release.
 
Although this trading restriction is subject to certain exceptions, given the complexity of these rules and the short period of time involved, you should avoid any change in your beneficial ownership of Applied Materials stock during the 401(k) blackout period, including purchases and sales of Applied shares held outside of the 401(k) Plan and exercises of stock options.
 
If you have any questions concerning this notice or the 401(k) blackout period, please contact Charmaine Mesina, Managing Director, Corporate Legal Services, in writing at Applied Materials, Inc., 3050 Bowers Avenue, P.O. Box 58039, M/S 2062, Santa Clara, CA 95052-8039, by telephone at (408) 563-2153, or by email at Charmaine_Mesina@amat.com.

Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
On May 12, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. (the "Committee") dismissed Mohler, Nixon & Williams Accountancy Corporation ("Mohler Nixon") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the "Plan"). On May 12, 2005, the Committee appointed Armanino McKenna LLP ("Armanino") as the Plan's new independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
(a) Former independent registered public accounting firm.
 
Mohler Nixon's reports on the audited financial statements of the Plan for the two most recent years, which ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In connection with its audits of the Plan's financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and through May 12, 2005, there were no disagreements with Mohler Nixon on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mohler Nixon, would have caused Mohler Nixon to make reference thereto in its reports on the financial statements for such years. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and through May 12, 2005, there were no "reportable events," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K with respect to the Plan.
 
The Committee provided Mohler Nixon with a copy of the statements made in this Form 8-K and requested that Mohler Nixon furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether Mohler Nixon agrees with these statements. A copy of Mohler Nixon's letter dated May 12, 2005 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
(b) New independent registered public accounting firm.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and through May 12, 2005, neither the Plan nor anyone on its behalf consulted Armanino regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 4, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved the vesting acceleration of certain unvested, "out-of-the-money" stock options outstanding under Applied's employee stock option plans effective August 5, 2005. Vesting was accelerated for stock options that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of Applied common stock on August 5, 2005, which was $17.85. Stock options held by Applied's most senior executive officers, namely James C. Morgan, Michael R. Splinter, Nancy H. Handel, Franz Janker and David N.K.Wang; non-employee directors; and consultants were not included in the vesting acceleration.
 
This acceleration will reduce the impact of future compensation expense that Applied would otherwise be required to recognize in future consolidated statements of operations pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), ("SFAS 123R"). Applied will be required to implement the expense recognition provisions of SFAS 123R starting with the first quarter of its fiscal year 2006 that begins on October 31, 2005. As a result of the acceleration, Applied expects to reduce compensation expense it otherwise would be required to record by approximately $138 million on a pre-tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The vesting acceleration of these stock options is not expected to result in a charge to earnings based on accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. This accelerated vesting may also have a positive effect on employee morale and retention.
Share-Based Payment
 
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to the estimated reduction in compensation expense required to be recognized under SFAS 123R, the accounting treatment for the acceleration and the effect upon employees. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements including, without limitation, the possibility that subsequent pronouncements or interpretations of SFAS 123R may alter the accounting treatment of stock options, as well as other risks described in Applied Materials' most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and Applied Materials undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(1) Form of Restricted Stock Agreement
 
On September 14, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Applied Materials, Inc.'s ("Applied") Board of Directors (the "Committee") approved a form of Restricted Stock Agreement for use under Applied's Employee Stock Incentive Plan.
 
. The Restricted Stock Agreement provides for the grant of a number of shares of Applied common stock subject to a vesting schedule. The recipient must pay a purchase price per share equal to the par value of Applied's common stock ($0.01), payable either by cash or check for new hires or by past services rendered to Applied for existing employees. Applied will withhold a portion of the shares subject to the grant to cover applicable tax withholdings, unless the recipient makes alternate arrangements satisfactory to Applied.
General Terms
 
. Shares of restricted stock will be held in escrow until vesting. The Restricted Stock Agreement provides that vesting automatically will be delayed and/or shares will be forfeited upon certain changes to employment status, such as reductions to part-time status and personal leaves of absence for specified durations, and that all unvested shares will vest in full in the event of the recipient's death while he or she is an employee. Shares that have not vested by the time of a recipient's termination of service with Applied will be forfeited.
Vesting
 
. A restricted stock award recipient generally will have the rights of an Applied stockholder, including voting rights, with respect to the shares upon their issuance, except as described in this paragraph or as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of grant. Any quarterly or other regular, periodic dividends that are paid on unvested shares will be forfeited and Applied generally will be entitled to receive any dividends and distributions on any shares held in escrow until the shares have vested. However, a recipient generally will be entitled to receive any stock or extraordinary cash dividends, but if any such dividend relates to unvested shares of restricted stock, the dividend generally will be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions applicable to the unvested restricted stock.
Stockholder Rights
 
(2) Form of Performance Share Agreement
 
On the same date, the Committee also approved a form of Performance Share Agreement for use under Applied's Employee Stock Incentive Plan.
 
. The Performance Share Agreement provides for the grant of a number of performance shares, also called restricted stock units, which will be paid out in shares of Applied common stock once the applicable vesting and/or performance criteria have been met. Upon payout of the shares, the recipient must pay a purchase price per share equal to the par value of Applied's common stock ($0.01), payable through the recipient's past services rendered to Applied. Applied will withhold a portion of the shares subject to the grant to cover applicable tax withholdings, unless the recipient makes alternate arrangements satisfactory to Applied.
General Terms
 
. The Performance Share Agreement provides that vesting automatically will be delayed and/or shares will be forfeited upon certain changes to employment status, such as reductions to part-time status and personal leaves of absence for specified durations, and that all unvested performance shares will vest in full in the event of the recipient's death while he or she is an employee. Performance shares that have not vested by the time of a recipient's termination of service with Applied will be forfeited.
Vesting
. A performance share award recipient generally will have the rights of an Applied stockholder, including voting rights, after actual Applied shares are issued in respect of the performance share award, except as described in this paragraph or as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of grant. Any quarterly or other regular, periodic dividends or distributions paid on shares will not be paid on unvested performance shares nor will they affect such shares in any way. However, a recipient generally will be entitled to receive any stock or extraordinary cash dividends, but if any such dividend relates to unvested performance shares, the dividend generally will be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions applicable to the unvested performance shares.

1. . The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan an award of Shares for $0.01 per Share, commencing on the Grant Date, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. By accepting this grant of Restricted Stock, the par value purchase price for each Share of Restricted Stock (a) will be deemed paid by the Employee by past services rendered by the Employee, if the Employee is an existing employee of the Company or one of its Affiliates and not a newly-hired employee, or (b) shall be paid to the Company by cash or check by the Employee, if the Employee is a newly-hired employee of the Company or one of its Affiliates.
Grant
[Number]
 
2. . Unless and until the Shares will have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 3 through 5, such Shares will be issued in the name of the Employee and held by the Stock Programs Department of the Company (or its designee) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), and will not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, and will not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated. The Company may determine to issue the Shares in book entry form and/or may instruct the transfer agent for its Common Stock to place a legend on the certificates representing the Restricted Stock or otherwise note its records as to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. The certificate or certificates representing such Shares will not be delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Employee unless and until the Shares have vested and all other terms and conditions in this Agreement have been satisfied.
Shares Held in Escrow
 
3. . Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, and subject to paragraph 6, the Shares awarded by this Agreement shall vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth on the first page of this Agreement. Shares shall not vest in the Employee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement unless the Employee shall have been continuously employed by the Company or by one of its Affiliates from the Grant Date until the date otherwise is scheduled to occur.
Vesting Schedule/Period of Restriction
 
4.
Modifications to Vesting Schedule.
 
(a) In the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliate changes from full-time status to part-time status, and the change to part-time status lasts more than six (6) months during any rolling twelve (12) month period, the Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest during the twelve (12) months following the day the Employee first attains part-time status (as defined below) shall be determined according to the following formula (rounded to the nearest whole share):
Vesting upon Change to Part-time Status.
 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, "part-time status" means the Employee is scheduled to work an average number of hours per week that equals seventy-five percent (75%) or less of the total number of hours in a standard work week for a period greater than six (6) months, as determined over a rolling twelve (12) month period.
 
Only Shares that are not yet vested may be modified pursuant to the preceding formula. Shares awarded by this Agreement that are no longer vested as a result of the change to part-time status never will vest and instead will terminate. The preceding formula will be reapplied if the Employee continues to be on part-time status following the conclusion of the twelve (12) month measurement period. The number of Shares awarded by this Agreement shall be modified according to the preceding formula unless otherwise recommended by the Company's Vice President of Human Resources ("VP of HR") and approved by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") or prohibited by applicable law. If the Employee is or was an executive officer of the Company, any modification of the preceding formula instead is subject to the approval of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
 
(i) Example 1. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Shares on July 1, 2007. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 20 hours per week, and continues to work 20 hours per week for 2 months. Employee still will be scheduled to vest in 100 Shares on July 1, 2007.
 
(ii) Example 2. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Shares on July 1, 2007. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 20 hours per week, and continues to work 20 hours per week for 7 months. Employee now will be scheduled to vest in 50 Shares on July 1, 2007. The other 50 Shares that were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2007 never will vest and instead will terminate.
 
(iii) Example 3. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Shares on December 1, 2006. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 30 hours per week, and continues to work 30 hours per week for 9 months. Employee therefore attains part-time status on November 2, 2006. Employee now will be scheduled to vest in 75 Shares on December 1, 2006. The other 25 Shares that were scheduled to vest on December 1, 2006 never will vest and instead will terminate.
 
In the event applicable law prohibits the modification under the preceding formula, the Employee agrees that the CEO may extend the vesting period with respect to an award of Restricted Stock or reduce the Shares awarded by this Agreement on a pro rata basis, as reasonably determined by the CEO and to the extent permitted under applicable law, commensurate with the Employee's change to part-time status; provided that any such modification shall not affect a greater number of Shares than the number of Shares that would have been modified pursuant to the preceding formula.
 
(b) In the event that the Employee takes a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest shall be modified as follows:
Vesting upon Personal Leave of Absence.
 
(i) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is six (6) months or less, the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement shall not be affected by the Employee's PLOA.
 
(ii) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is greater than six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months, the scheduled vesting of any Shares awarded by this Agreement that are not then vested shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the Employee's PLOA less six (6) months unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR.
 
(iii) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is greater than twelve (12) months, any Shares awarded by this Agreement that are not then vested immediately will terminate unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR and approved by the CEO.
 
(iv) Example 1. Employee is scheduled to vest in Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 6-month PLOA. Employee's Shares still will be scheduled to vest on January 1, 2007.
 
(v) Example 2. Employee is scheduled to vest in Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 9-month PLOA. Employee's Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest after November 2, 2006 will be modified (this is the date on which the Employee's PLOA exceeds six (6) months). Employee's Shares now will be scheduled to vest on April 1, 2007 (three (3) months after the originally scheduled date).
 
(vi) Example 3. Employee is scheduled to vest in Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 13-month PLOA. Employee's Shares will terminate on May 2, 2007 unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR and approved by the CEO.
 
In general, a "personal leave of absence" does not include any legally required leave of absence. The duration of the Employee's PLOA will be determined over a rolling twelve (12) month measurement period. Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest during the first six (6) months of the Employee's PLOA will continue to vest as scheduled. However, Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest after the first six (6) months of the Employee's PLOA will be deferred or terminated depending on the length of the Employee's PLOA. The Employee's right to vest in Shares awarded by this Agreement shall be modified as soon as the duration of the Employee's PLOA exceeds six (6) months.
 
(c) . In the event that the Employee incurs a Termination of Service due to his or her death, one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares subject to this Restricted Stock award shall vest on the date of the Employee's death. In the event that any applicable law limits the Company's ability to accelerate the vesting of this award of Restricted Stock, this Paragraph 4 shall be limited to the extent required to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is subject to Hong Kong's ORSO provisions, the first sentence of this Paragraph 4 (relating to accelerated vesting upon death) shall not apply to this award of Restricted Stock.
Death of Employee
 
5. . The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Shares at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Shares will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.
Committee Discretion
 
6. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the balance of the Shares that have not vested at the time of Employee's Termination of Service will be forfeited and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company upon the date the Employee incurs a Termination of Service for any reason. The Employee shall not be entitled to a refund of the price paid for the Shares returned to the Company pursuant to this paragraph 6. The Employee hereby appoints the Escrow Agent with full power of substitution, as the Employee's true and lawful attorney-in-fact with irrevocable power and authority in the name and on behalf of the Employee to take any action and execute all documents and instruments, including, without limitation, stock powers which may be necessary to transfer the certificate or certificates evidencing such unvested Shares to the Company upon such Termination of Service.
Forfeiture
 
7. . The Company (or the employing Affiliate) will withhold a portion of the Shares that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay the minimum federal, state and local income, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or the employing Affiliate with respect to the Shares, unless the Employee makes alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for such withholdings in advance of the arising of any withholding obligations. The number of Shares withheld pursuant to the prior sentence will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, with no refund for any value of the Shares withheld in excess of the tax obligation as a result of such rounding. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no Restricted Stock will be granted unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee) will have been made by the Employee with respect to the payment of any income and other taxes which the Company determines must be withheld or collected with respect to such Shares. In addition and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to the Employee, cash having a sufficient value to satisfy any tax withholding obligations that the Company determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of otherwise deliverable Shares.
Withholding of Taxes
 
8. . Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or the Escrow Agent. Except as provided in paragraph 10, after such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this Agreement, any quarterly or other regular, periodic dividends (as determined by the Company) paid on unvested Shares shall be forfeited by the Employee and automatically returned to the Company. The Company shall be entitled to receive any dividends and/or distributions on any Shares held by the Escrow Agent until such Shares have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 3 through 5.
Rights as Stockholder
 
9. . Subject to any employment contract with the Employee, the terms of such employment will be determined from time to time by the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, and the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time. A leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Company or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, shall not be deemed a Termination of Service for the purposes of this Agreement.
No Effect on Employment
 
10. . In the event that as a result of a stock or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, combination of Shares or the adjustment in capital stock of the Company or otherwise, or as a result of a merger, consolidation, spin-off or other corporate transaction or event, the Shares will be increased, reduced or otherwise affected, and by virtue of any such event the Employee will in his or her capacity as owner of unvested Shares which have been awarded to him or her (the "Prior Shares") be entitled to new or additional or different shares of stock, cash or other securities or property (other than rights or warrants to purchase securities); such new or additional or different shares, cash or securities or property will thereupon be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions that were applicable to the Prior Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan. If the Employee receives rights or warrants with respect to any Prior Shares, such rights or warrants may be held or exercised by the Employee, provided that until such exercise any such rights or warrants and after such exercise any shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants will be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Prior Shares pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement. The Committee in its absolute discretion at any time may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of such new or additional shares of stock, cash or securities, rights or warrants to purchase securities or shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants.
Changes in Shares
 
11. . Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of Stock Programs, at Applied Materials, Inc., 2881 Scott Blvd., M/S 2023, Santa Clara, CA 95050, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

12. . Except to the limited extent provided in this Agreement, the unvested Shares subject to this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process.

Applied Materials, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants you, (the "Employee"), an award of Performance Shares (also referred to as restricted stock units) under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The date of this Performance Share Agreement (the "Agreement") is [DATE]. Subject to the provisions of Appendix A (attached) and of the Plan, the principal features of this award are as follows:
[Name]
 
 
 
Your electronic or written signature below indicates your agreement and understanding that this award is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in Appendix A and the Plan. For example, important additional information on vesting and forfeiture of the Performance Shares is contained in paragraphs 3 through 5 and paragraph 7 of Appendix A.
PLEASE BE SURE TO READ ALL OF APPENDIX A, WHICH CONTAINS THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 
By clicking the "ACCEPT" button below, you agree to the following:
"This electronic contract contains my electronic signature, which I executed with the intent to sign this Agreement."
 
 
Please be sure to retain a copy of your returned electronically signed Agreement; you may obtain a paper copy at any time and at the Company's expense by requesting one from Stock Programs (see paragraph 12 below). If you prefer not to electronically sign this Agreement, you may accept this Agreement by signing a paper copy of the Agreement and delivering it to Stock Programs.
 
 
 
 
1. . The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan [] Performance Shares (also referred to as restricted stock units), subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. When the Performance Shares are paid to the Employee, par value will be deemed paid by the Employee for each Performance Share by past services rendered by the Employee, and will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings.
Grant
            
 
2. . Each Performance Share has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. Unless and until the Performance Shares have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 3 through 5, the Employee will have no right to payment of such Performance Shares. Prior to actual payment of any vested Performance Shares, such Performance Shares will represent an unsecured obligation.
Company's Obligation to Pay
 
3. . Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, and subject to paragraph 7, the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement shall vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth on the first page of this Agreement. Performance Shares shall not vest in the Employee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement unless the Employee shall have been continuously employed by the Company or by one of its Affiliates from the Grant Date until the date the Performance Shares are otherwise scheduled to vest occurs.
Vesting Schedule/Period of Restriction
 
4. .
Modifications to Vesting Schedule
 
(a) In the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliate changes from full-time status to part-time status, and the change to part-time status lasts more than six (6) months during any rolling twelve (12) month period, the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest during the twelve (12) months following the day the Employee first attains part-time status (as defined below) shall be determined according to the following formula (rounded to the nearest whole share):
Vesting upon Change to Part-time Status.
 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, "part-time status" means the Employee is scheduled to work an average number of hours per week that equals seventy-five percent (75%) or less of the total number of hours in a standard work week for a period greater than six (6) months, as determined over a rolling twelve (12) month period.
 
Only Performance Shares that are not yet vested may be modified pursuant to the preceding formula. Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are no longer vested as a result of the
 
change to part-time status never will vest and instead will terminate. The preceding formula will be reapplied if the Employee continues to be on part-time status following the conclusion of the twelve (12) month measurement period. The number of Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement shall be modified according to the preceding formula unless otherwise recommended by the Company's Vice President of Human Resources ("VP of HR") and approved by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") or prohibited by applicable law. If the Employee is or was an executive officer of the Company, any modification of the preceding formula instead is subject to the approval of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
 
(i) Example 1. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Performance Shares on July 1, 2007. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 20 hours per week, and continues to work 20 hours per week for 2 months. Employee still will be scheduled to vest in 100 Performance Shares on July 1, 2007.
 
(ii) Example 2. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Performance Shares on July 1, 2007. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 20 hours per week, and continues to work 20 hours per week for 7 months. Employee now will be scheduled to vest in 50 Performance Shares on July 1, 2007. The other 50 Performance Shares that were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2007 never will vest and instead will terminate.
 
(iii) Example 3. Employee is scheduled to vest in 100 Performance Shares on December 1, 2006. Employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins working 30 hours per week, and continues to work 30 hours per week for 9 months. Employee therefore attains part-time status on November 2, 2006. Employee now will be scheduled to vest in 75 Performance Shares on December 1, 2006. The other 25 Performance Shares that were scheduled to vest on December 1, 2006 never will vest and instead will terminate.
 
In the event applicable law prohibits the modification under the preceding formula, the Employee agrees that the CEO may extend the vesting period with respect to an award of Performance Shares or reduce the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement on a pro rata basis, as reasonably determined by the CEO and to the extent permitted under applicable law, commensurate with the Employee's change to part-time status; provided that any such modification shall not affect a greater number of Performance Shares than the number of Performance Shares that would have been modified pursuant to the preceding formula.
 
(b) In the event that the Employee takes a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest shall be modified as follows:
Vesting upon Personal Leave of Absence.
 
(i) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is six (6) months or less, the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement shall not be affected by the Employee's PLOA.
 
(ii) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is greater than six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months, the scheduled vesting of any Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are not then vested shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the Employee's PLOA less six (6) months unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR.
 
(iii) if the duration of the Employee's PLOA is greater than twelve (12) months, any Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are not then vested immediately will terminate unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR and approved by the CEO.
 
(iv) Example 1. Employee is scheduled to vest in Performance Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 6-month PLOA. Employee's Performance Shares still will be scheduled to vest on January 1, 2007.
 
(v) Example 2. Employee is scheduled to vest in Performance Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 9-month PLOA. Employee's Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest after November 2, 2006 will be modified (this is the date on which the Employee's PLOA exceeds six (6) months). Employee's Performance Shares now will be scheduled to vest on April 1, 2007 (three (3) months after the originally scheduled date).
 
(vi) Example 3. Employee is scheduled to vest in Performance Shares on January 1, 2007. On May 1, 2006, Employee begins a 13-month PLOA. Employee's Performance Shares will terminate on May 2, 2007 unless otherwise recommended by the Company's VP of HR and approved by the CEO.
 
In general, a "personal leave of absence" does not include any legally required leave of absence. The duration of the Employee's PLOA will be determined over a rolling twelve (12) month measurement period. Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest during the first six (6) months of the Employee's PLOA will continue to vest as scheduled. However, Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest after the first six (6) months of the Employee's PLOA will be deferred or terminated depending on the length of the Employee's PLOA. The Employee's right to vest in Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement shall be modified as soon as the duration of the Employee's PLOA exceeds six (6) months.
 
(c) . In the event that the Employee incurs a Termination of Service due to his or her death, one hundred percent (100%) of the Performance Shares subject to this Performance Share award shall vest on the date of the Employee's death. In the event that any applicable law limits the Company's ability to accelerate the vesting of this award of Performance Shares, this paragraph 4 shall be limited to the extent required to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is subject to Hong Kong's ORSO provisions, the first sentence of this paragraph 4 (relating to accelerated vesting upon death) shall not apply to this award of Performance Shares.
Death of Employee
 
5. . The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Performance Shares at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Performance Shares will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.
Committee Discretion
 
6. . Any Performance Shares that vest in accordance with paragraphs 3 through 5 will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate) in Shares that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Shares at vesting as soon as practicable following the date of vesting, subject to paragraph 8.
Payment after Vesting
 
7. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the balance of the Performance Shares that have not vested pursuant to paragraphs 3 through 5 at the time of the Employee's Termination of Service for any or no reason will be forfeited and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company. The Employee shall not be entitled to a refund of the price paid for the Performance Shares forfeited to the Company pursuant to this paragraph 7.
Forfeiture
 
8. . When the Shares are issued as payment for vested Performance Shares, the Company (or the employing Affiliate) will withhold a portion of the Shares that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay the minimum federal, state and local income, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or the employing Affiliate with respect to the Shares, unless the Employee makes alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for such withholdings in advance of the arising of any withholding obligations. The number of Shares withheld pursuant to the prior sentence will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, with no refund for any value of the Shares withheld in excess of the tax obligation as a result of such rounding. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no Shares will be issued unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee) have been made by the Employee with respect to the payment of any income and other taxes which the Company determines must be withheld or collected with respect to such Shares. In addition and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to the Employee, cash having a sufficient value to satisfy any tax withholding obligations that the Company determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of otherwise deliverable Shares.
Withholding of Taxes
 
9. . Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this Agreement, any quarterly or other regular, periodic dividends or distributions (as determined by the Company) paid on Shares will not affect unvested Performance Shares and no such dividends or other distributions will be paid on unvested Performance Shares. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
Rights as Stockholder
 
10. . Subject to any employment contract with the Employee, the terms of such employment will be determined from time to time by the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, and the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time. A leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an
No Effect on Employment
 
interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Company or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, shall not be deemed a Termination of Service for the purposes of this Agreement.
 
11. . In the event that as a result of a stock or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, combination of Shares or the adjustment in capital stock of the Company or otherwise, or as a result of a merger, consolidation, spin-off or other corporate transaction or event, the Shares will be increased, reduced or otherwise affected, and by virtue of any such event the Employee will in his or her capacity as owner of unvested Performance Shares which have been awarded to him or her (the "Prior Shares") be entitled to new or additional or different shares of stock, cash or other securities or property (other than rights or warrants to purchase securities); such new or additional or different shares, cash or securities or property will thereupon be considered to be unvested Performance Shares and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions that were applicable to the Prior Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan. If the Employee receives rights or warrants with respect to any Prior Shares, such rights or warrants may be held or exercised by the Employee, provided that until such exercise any such rights or warrants and after such exercise any shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants will be considered to be unvested Performance Shares and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Prior Shares pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement. The Committee in its absolute discretion at any time may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of such new or additional shares of stock, cash or securities, rights or warrants to purchase securities or shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants.
Changes in Shares
 
12. . Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of Stock Programs, at Applied Materials, Inc., 2881 Scott Boulevard, M/S 2023, Santa Clara, CA 95050, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

Except to the limited extent provided in this Agreement, this grant of Performance Shares and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process, until you have been issued the Shares. Upon any attempt to sell, pledge, assign, hypothecate, transfer or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(1) Amendment to the Applied Materials, Inc. Relocation Policy
 
Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") maintains a Relocation Policy (the "Policy") under which eligible exempt and technical non-exempt college summer interns and co-ops, regular full-time college hires, new hires and internal transferees, international new hires and transferees on indefinite assignments (together, we refer to them as "eligible employees") may receive certain relocation assistance benefits.
 
The specific relocation benefits that may be available under the Policy to an eligible employee vary according to employment grade level, new hire and transferee status, location and other factors. For example, relocation benefits may include the shipment and storage of household goods, temporary living assistance and/or paid time off to attend to relocation needs. Some other examples of relocation benefits that may be offered include payment for driving time spent to relocate, reimbursement for reasonable and customary closing costs on a first mortgage for a new home, and/or a home sale assistance benefit that provides for Applied's purchase of an employee's home if, in accordance with the Policy and the specific benefit terms, the employee has made specified efforts to sell the home but cannot secure an outside buyer to purchase the home at its appraised value within a specified period of time.
 
Relocation benefits generally must be reimbursed to Applied Materials on a pro rata basis if the eligible employee terminates employment within 18 months of his or her start date or effective transfer date, although Applied has the discretion to dismiss the reimbursement requirement if the person's employment has been terminated for business or economic reasons. Relocation benefits generally are available for up to one year from an employee's start date or effective transfer date, as applicable. However, the Company may extend the time period for which relocation benefits are available and may otherwise amend an employee's eligibility for relocation benefits.
 
On October 27, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Committee") amended the Policy to provide that extensions of the one-year period for eligible employees may be approved by Applied's Human Resources Vice President alone, except that extensions of the one-year period for executive officers must be approved by the Committee. The Committee also amended the Policy to require that all exceptions to the Policy made for Applied executive officers in excess of $50,000 be approved by the Committee.
 
(2) Extension of Michael R. Splinter's Relocation Benefits
 
On the same date, the Committee approved an extension of the period during which certain relocation benefits under the Policy are available to Michael R. Splinter, Applied's President and Chief Executive Officer. His eligibility for relocation benefits (to the extent not previously used) has been extended through December 31, 2005.

The specific relocation benefits for which an employee is eligible may vary according to the grade level, new hire/transferee status, location, etc.
 
In order to be eligible, an employee (except for college interns and coops) must meet the following IRS regulations.
 
1. Distance Test: The distance between the former residence and new place of work must be 50 miles greater than the distance between the former residence and former place of work.
 
2. 39 Week Test: The employee must be employed full-time for 39 weeks during a twelve month period beginning when the employee arrives at the new work location. If the company requests another move before the 39 weeks has accumulated, the IRS will not disqualify excludable relocation expenses.
 
College hires must have a permanent address more than 50 miles from the Applied Materials site to which they are assigned. If school is the employee's permanent address and it is within 50 miles of the Applied Materials site to which the employee is assigned, no relocation benefits will be provided to the college hire.
 
An employee is eligible for authorized relocation benefits for up to one year from the start date and/or effective transfer date. Applied Materials reserves the right to cancel or amend an employee's eligibility for relocation benefits at any time. Any extension of the one-year period referred to above may be approved by the Human Resources Vice President alone, except that any extension of the one-year period for an executive officer of Applied Materials must be approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials. When an employee requests a transfer from one location to another location, Applied Materials is not obligated to pay for relocation costs associated with the move.
Before any relocation benefits can begin or payments to the employee be processed, the employee must sign the Relocation Cost Reimbursement Agreement and submit it to the Global Relocation department. As set forth in the Relocation Cost Reimbursement Agreement, if the employee voluntarily terminates employment or is involuntarily terminated within 18 months of start date/effective transfer date, the employee is required to reimburse Applied Materials for relocation costs on a pro-rated basis. Where Applied Materials is required to terminate employment for business or economic reasons or lack of work, Applied Materials retains the discretion to dismiss this reimbursement requirement. Due to the length of their assignment, co-ops and interns are not required to sign and are not subject to the provisions of the Relocation Cost Reimbursement Agreement.
 
Relocation assistance is limited to one member of a household where there is more than one member employed by Applied Materials. Applied Materials will relocate the employee, spouse/partner and dependent family members who currently reside with the employee. Dependent family members are children up to the age of 18 or full-time dependent college students, pursuant to IRS regulations.
 
Transferred employees will be paid base salary while driving to the new location. The IRS regulations require travel of 350 miles per day in order to be reimbursed for enroute travel when driving to new location. Management may permit the employee up to 2 paid days off from work for relocation needs such as house/school selection and packing/unpacking of household goods. Approval for time off is at Management discretion.
 
Where the Company provides temporary living arrangements, the employee will be held responsible for any damages to the temporary accommodations incurred during its occupancy.
 
In order to qualify for the Global Relocation Home Sale Programs and in accordance with IRS regulations, the employee must consult with the Global Relocation Department before listing the primary residence for sale or he/she will not qualify for reimbursement of closing costs. These program benefits are set forth under the relocation benefits matrices.
 
RELOCATION-ASSOCIATED TAX:
 
Each year Applied Materials will apply current IRS tax laws and definitions in determining the taxable, excludable, and deductible relocation expenses. Only taxable relocation expenses are eligible for tax assistance under this policy. Reimbursed taxable relocation expenses that may be deducted on an employee's tax returns are not eligible for tax assistance.
 
Federal income tax laws, state laws and regulations require any amount paid to the employee or paid on his/her behalf for moving expenses to be reported on the employee's W-2 form in the year it was paid. The Applied Materials Payroll Department will deposit tax amounts directly with the appropriate tax agency.
The tax rate utilized under this policy is limited to the federal supplemental tax rate, new state supplemental tax rate, and FICA tax rate where applicable.
 
FICA taxes are paid only if the employee's regular annualized base salary is less than the maximum FICA taxable salary established by the Social Security Administration and only to the extent additional tax liability is created due to the relocation.
 
Due to the complexities of calculating taxes, the amount of tax assistance may be more or less than the employee's actual tax liability. The employee is responsible for filing his or her own tax return. Information contained in this policy should not be construed as tax advice. All tax questions should be referred to a professional tax consultant. Applied Materials will not be responsible for tax consultant fees.
 
For information regarding specific relocation benefits, please refer to your HR representative or the Global Relocation Department.
 
DEFINITIONS:
 
Technical non-exempt positions are positions that require an associates degree and higher or the equivalency. These positions do not include administrative assistants, material coordinators or material analysts.
 
PROCEDURES:
 
Divisional HR will forward a copy of the completed and approved hiring forms (eRecruit) for new hires and international hires or Employee Action Report (EAR) for internal transfers with the cost estimate for the appropriate relocation benefits to the Global Relocation Department. Approvals must follow the Signature Authority guidelines in effect for eRecruit Offers or the EAR.
 
After the eRecruit hiring forms or EAR is approved, a relocation benefit letter describing the approved benefits will be provided to the employee by Human Resources along with the offer of employment. Letters with any policy exceptions will be completed by Global Relocation and provided to HR.
 
The Global Relocation Department will administer all relocation benefits in order to comply with the IRS guidelines. The Global Relocation Department cannot administer relocation benefits for the employee without the proper approved paperwork from Human Resources.
 
The employee is responsible for completing, obtaining signatures and submitting all Relocation Expense Reports for reimbursements where receipts are required to be submitted to the Global Relocation Department. Relocation expense reports follow the
Finance Signature Policy. The Global Relocation Department will submit all reimbursements and direct bills to the North America Shared Service Center (NASSC) for payment.
 
Any and all exceptions to the relocation benefits require the approval of a Divisional VP/General Manager, HR Manager, Divisional Controller, Director of Global Relocation Department. All exceptions in excess of $10,000 require the additional approval of the Appointed Vice President, Global Compensation and Benefits. Exceptions over $10,000 may also require the approval of the Human Resources Vice President at the discretion of the Appointed Vice President, Global Compensation and Benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, exceptions in excess of $50,000 for executive officers shall require the approval of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials in lieu of all other approvals required by this paragraph.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On January 24, 2006, the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") approved a plan to disinvest a portion of the Company's real estate and facilities portfolio (the "Plan") based on management's evaluation of the size, location and capability of Applied's global infrastructure in light of anticipated business needs. Under the Plan, the Company expects to sell or otherwise dispose of certain owned or leased facilities located in Hayward, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; Danvers, Massachusetts; Chunan, South Korea; and Narita, Japan that were determined to be non-strategic. These facilities were acquired either as part of a merger or under business conditions that have changed. This action is not expected to adversely impact the Company's ability to serve its customers or execute its business strategies. Applied intends to complete the Plan as soon as feasible.
 
Applied expects to record pre-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $212 million in its first fiscal quarter ending January 29, 2006, consisting of approximately $122 million for asset write-offs and impairments and approximately $90 million for restructuring of lease obligations. The Company does not expect severance costs to be material. Expected future cash expenditures as a result of implementing the Plan relate principally to the lease restructuring and are anticipated to total approximately $109 million. These expenditures will be offset in part by projected proceeds from the sale of the properties. Average savings associated with the Plan are projected to be approximately $29 million annually through 2014. These forecasts may change as the activities under the Plan are completed.

This report contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the effect of the Plan and the expected amounts of charges, future cash expenditures, proceeds of sale and annual savings.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 24, 2006, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved the performance goals and a bonus formula under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan") that will be used to calculate bonus awards for Applied's most senior executive officers for fiscal year 2006.
 
As set forth in the Plan document that was approved by Applied's stockholders at the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Committee may choose from a range of specified and defined performance measures in setting the performance goals.
 
For Michael R. Splinter, President and Chief Executive Officer; Franz Janker, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Nancy H. Handel, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the Committee chose three primary measures: Applied's earnings per share, Applied's relative annual revenue growth, and certain strategic goals, which include entry into new markets, extension of Applied's leadership, and strong operational and financial performance.
 
For Farhad Moghadam, Senior Vice President, General Manager Thin Films Product Business Group and Foundation Engineering; Thomas St. Dennis, Senior Vice President, General Manager Etch and Front End Products Business Group; and Mark R. Pinto, Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and General Manager New Business and New Products Group, the Committee chose three primary measures: Applied's earnings per share, financial and operational objectives for each officer's respective business units, and certain strategic goals that are similar or the same as described above. Depending on the respective business units for which each officer has responsibility, the financial and operational objectives relate to business unit revenue, profits, quality and reliability, efficiency, product development, customer satisfaction, technological innovation and leadership and human resources.
 
Even if the goals described above are achieved, no bonus will be paid under the Plan unless Applied achieves a specified level of profit after tax. If a bonus does become payable under the formula, the bonus may be increased if Applied's total stockholder return for the year is positive and exceeds the total stockholder return for a diversified group of other large capitalization companies. However, a bonus first must be earned under the applicable bonus formula. No bonus will be payable solely on account of total stockholder return performance. The bonus to Michael R. Splinter under the Plan will range from zero to 450% of his annual base salary. The bonus for the other executive officers named above will range from zero to 375% of annual base salary, depending on the officer. For all of the officers, the maximum bonus will be payable only if actual performance significantly exceeds all targeted goals and total stockholder return is extremely high compared to the other specified large companies.
 
The actual bonuses paid (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals described above. Extraordinary, non-recurring items generally will be excluded when determining actual performance, unless otherwise determined by the Committee during its regular review of actual performance versus the specified goals. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the bonus that otherwise would be payable under the Plan based on actual performance. An executive must remain an employee for all of fiscal year 2006 in order to be eligible for any bonus under the Plan.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

"We are seeing momentum across our broad product portfolio for both high-volume production and leading-edge 65nm and 45nm chip development applications.
     "Our differentiated nanomanufacturing technologies are providing solutions to customers' most challenging requirements, from strain engineering processes to enable faster transistor performance, to advanced deposition and etch systems for today's Flash and DRAM memory chips. Our innovative thin film and mask metrology processes are extending current lithography technology into future device generations.
     "We are confident that our broad technology solutions position Applied to outgrow and outperform the industry and deliver strong financial results," concluded Splinter.
     The company continued to return value to stockholders through stock repurchases and cash dividends. During the first fiscal quarter of 2006, the company repurchased approximately 27 million shares of common stock at an average price of $18.84 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million and paid $48 million in dividends.
     This press release includes financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP, consisting of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes that these measures are useful to investors because they enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges related to (i) asset impairments and restructuring associated with Applied's disinvestment of a portion of its real estate and facilities portfolio, and (ii) equity-based compensation. These financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported net income and reported EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
     This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the company's performance, growth, momentum, product capabilities, technology leadership, strategic position, financial results and delivery of stockholder value; customer demand and industry growth. Forward-looking statements may contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "may," "should," "will," "estimate," "forecast," "continue" or similar expressions, and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") announced on March 20, 2006 that Charles Y.S. Liu resigned as a member of the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors effective March 17, 2006. Mr. Liu was appointed to Applied's Board on September 14, 2005 and to the Board's Audit Committee on December 14, 2005. He remains a member of Applied's Board of Directors and of the Board's Strategy Committee. Mr. Liu is a nominee for election as a director at Applied's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Wednesday, March 22, 2006.
Mr. Liu's resignation from the Audit Committee followed Applied's receipt on March 16, 2006 of telephonic notice from Nasdaq staff that, in the staff's view, Mr. Liu did not meet the criteria for independence that all audit committee members must meet under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2). On March 17, 2006, Nasdaq issued a determination letter that confirmed the notice and further stated that, as a result of Mr. Liu's resignation from the Audit Committee, Applied has regained compliance with this rule and the matter is closed.
Under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15)(B), a director is not considered independent if he or she "accepted any payments from the company . . . in excess of $60,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of independence," other than specified payments such as "compensation for board or board committee service." As stated in Applied's Proxy Statement dated February 21, 2006, Mr. Liu served as a consultant to the Board for approximately three months prior to his appointment as a director, at which time his consulting services terminated. In connection with Mr. Liu's consulting services, Applied granted him an option to purchase 45,000 shares of Applied common stock, which option is scheduled to become exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning June 22, 2006. In his consulting agreement, Mr. Liu agreed that if he were later appointed to Applied's Board, this option would be in lieu of the initial stock option grant of 45,000 shares made to non-employee directors upon joining the Board. Accordingly, Mr. Liu did not receive any stock option grants upon becoming a director.
For purposes of calculating the $60,000 threshold for independence, Nasdaq staff advised Applied that they interpret Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15)(B) as requiring that Mr. Liu's stock options be valued in accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the date of grant, even though none of these options has yet vested or is currently exercisable. This rule interpretation has not been published by Nasdaq. However, in the interest of full cooperation with Nasdaq, Applied requested that Mr. Liu resign from its Audit Committee, and Mr. Liu promptly honored this request.
Mr. Liu's resignation from the Audit Committee leaves four remaining members, all of whom are independent in accordance with Rule 4200(a)(15)(B). Applied has been and continues to be in compliance with Nasdaq's requirement that a majority of its Board be independent.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Mr. Liu previously served as a member of the Audit Committee from December 14, 2005 to March 17, 2006.
Mr. Liu's reappointment to the Audit Committee follows Applied's receipt of a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") dated April 18, 2006, which stated that after reviewing additional information, Nasdaq had determined that the Board was not precluded by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15)(B)(i) from finding that Mr. Liu was an independent director. Nasdaq rescinded its earlier finding (stated in its March 17, 2006 letter to Applied) on Mr. Liu's eligibility to be an independent director, and ability to serve as a member of the Audit Committee under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2). Nasdaq's March 17, 2006 letter was disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied on March 20, 2006.
On May 2, 2006, following a recommendation by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, the Board determined that no relationship existed that would impair Mr. Liu's independence and that Mr. Liu met the criteria for independence required of all audit committee members under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2).

EXHIBIT 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 16, 2006  Applied Materials, Inc., reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006. Net sales were $2.25 billion, up 21 percent from $1.86 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2006, and up 21 percent from $1.86 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2005. Gross margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 was 46.5 percent, up from 45.1 percent for the first fiscal quarter of 2006, and up from 44.0 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2005. Net income for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 was $413 million, or $0.26 per share, up from net income of $143 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first fiscal quarter of 2006, and up from net income of $305 million, or $0.18 per share, for the second fiscal quarter of 2005.
     Non-GAAP net income was $453 million, or $0.29 per share, for the second fiscal quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP adjustments consisted principally of $55 million of equity-based compensation charges before tax, or $0.03 per diluted share after tax.
     New orders of $2.49 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 increased 22 percent from $2.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2006, and increased 60 percent from $1.55 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2005. Regional distribution of new orders for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 was: Korea 22 percent, Taiwan 19 percent, North America 18 percent, Japan 17 percent, Southeast Asia and China 14 percent, and Europe 10 percent. Backlog at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2006 was $2.93 billion, compared to $2.73 billion at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2006.
     "Demand for Applied Materials' leading-edge nanomanufacturing technology in the second quarter was strong and broad-based, contributing to our excellent results," said Mike Splinter, president and chief executive officer. "We are delivering on Applied's strategy to grow our core business, expand into adjacent markets and pursue exciting new opportunities such as solar. As we extend our product portfolio, we are further positioning the company to outgrow and outperform the industry."
     The company continued to return value to stockholders through stock repurchases and cash dividends. During the second fiscal quarter of 2006, the company repurchased approximately 28 million shares of common stock at an average price of $18.16 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million and paid $48 million in dividends.
 
     This press release includes financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP, consisting of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes that these measures are useful to investors because they enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, and (ii) asset impairment and restructuring activities. These financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported net income and reported EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
     This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the company's performance, growth opportunities, technology leadership, strategic position, delivery of stockholder value, and cash deployment strategies. Forward-looking statements may contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "may," "should," "will," "estimate," "forecast," "continue" or similar expressions, and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the sustainability of demand in the nanomanufacturing technology industry and broadening of demand for emerging applications such as solar, which are subject to many factors, including global economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, demand for electronic products and integrated circuits, and geopolitical uncertainties; customers' capacity requirements, including capacity utilizing the latest technology; the timing, rate, amount and sustainability of capital spending for new nanomanufacturing technology; the company's ability to successfully develop, deliver and support a broad range of products and to expand its markets and develop new markets; the successful integration and performance of acquired businesses; the effectiveness of strategic transactions; the company's ability to maintain effective cost controls and to timely align its cost structure with business conditions; the company's ability to effectively manage its resources and production capability, including its supply chain; and other risks described in Applied Materials' Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.1
Release:      Immediate
          SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 15, 2006  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its third fiscal quarter ended July 30, 2006. Net sales were $2.54 billion, up 13 percent from $2.25 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2006, and up 56 percent from $1.63 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2005. Gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 was 48.1 percent, up from 46.5 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2006, and up from 43.9 percent for the third fiscal quarter of 2005. Net income for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 was $512 million, or $0.33 per share, up from net income of $413 million, or $0.26 per share, for the second fiscal quarter of 2006, and up from net income of $370 million, or $0.23 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2005.
          Non-GAAP net income was $539 million, or $0.35 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP adjustments consisted principally of $54 million of equity-based compensation charges before tax, or $0.03 per diluted share after tax, and an in-process research and development charge of $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, associated with the acquisition of Applied Films Corporation. These items were offset by a $34 million tax benefit, or $0.02 per diluted share, primarily from the resolution of audits of prior years' income tax filings.
          New orders of $2.67 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 increased 7 percent from $2.49 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2006, and increased 82 percent from $1.47 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2005. Regional distribution of new orders for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 was: Taiwan 21 percent, Japan 20 percent, North America 18 percent, Korea 16 percent, Southeast Asia and China 16 percent, and Europe 9 percent. Backlog at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2006 was $3.32 billion, compared to $2.93 billion at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2006.
          "This quarter's strong results demonstrated Applied's market leadership with continued growth in orders, revenue and profitability," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "Broad-based demand for Applied Materials' nanomanufacturing technology solutions and improved market position in key product areas increased revenues. Improved profitability was driven by higher utilization of our factory, lower cycle times and other margin improvement programs.
 
          "We continued to execute our long-term growth strategy by entering new high growth areas through the acquisition of Applied Films and the formation of Sokudo, a joint venture with Dainippon Screen. These investments, together with our innovative technology solutions for transistors, interconnects, lithography-enabling films and fab operations, uniquely position the company for new levels of performance," Splinter concluded.
          During the third fiscal quarter of 2006, the company returned value to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 31 million shares of common stock at an average price of $16.30 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million, and paying $78 million in dividends.
          Applied Materials will discuss its third fiscal quarter 2006 results, along with its outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, on a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied Materials' web site.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., September 13, 2006  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that its Board of Directors has amended Applied's Corporate Governance Guidelines to implement a majority voting policy for electing directors that enhances the role of stockholders in the election process.
Under this policy, in the event that a nominee for director in an uncontested election receives more "withheld" votes for his or her election than "for" votes, the director must submit a resignation to the Board. The Board's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, will evaluate and make a recommendation to the Board with respect to the proffered resignation. The Board must take action on the recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. No director who tenders a resignation may participate in the Committee's or the Board's consideration of the matter. The company will publicly disclose the Board's decision including, as applicable, the reasons for rejecting a resignation. Applied's directors are elected to serve one-year terms.
"We are committed to upholding high standards in corporate governance," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "Today's action increases our Board's accountability to our stockholders by formalizing the consequences in the event a director receives a majority of withheld votes."

On September 13, 2006, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") amended the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to change the grant date for annual stock option grants to non-employee directors.

The Committee approved an amendment that changes the grant date of the Automatic Grant from the last business day of Applied's fiscal year to the first business day of Applied's subsequent fiscal year. The amendment will be effective immediately so that Automatic Grants for fiscal year 2006 will be granted on October 30, 2006 (the first business day of fiscal year 2007) rather than October 27, 2006 (the last business day of fiscal year 2006).

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 14, 2006, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into a U.S. $100,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") with Citicorp USA, Inc., as lender. The Credit Agreement becomes effective on September 17, 2006 and replaces a $250,000,000 credit facility expiring on September 17, 2006.
The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings (advances) not to exceed U.S. $100,000,000 at interest rates keyed to one of various rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus, in certain cases, an applicable margin and/or a utilization fee. The Credit Agreement also requires payment of certain customary fees and expenses. Advances under the Credit Agreement will be unsecured.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type. The Credit Agreement also requires maintenance of a funded debt to adjusted earnings ratio. A default under the Credit Agreement may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with covenants, a failure to pay certain financial obligations, or an acceleration of certain debt obligations. A default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lender to require repayment of any outstanding amounts.
Any advances under the Credit Agreement are expected to be used by Applied for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on September 16, 2007, at which time all outstanding amounts will become due and payable.
The lender and certain of its affiliates have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, banking and other transactions with Applied, including previous credit facilities. These parties have received, and in the future may receive, customary compensation from Applied for these services.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
As discussed under Item 1.01 above, on September 14, 2006, Applied entered into the Credit Agreement. The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference. Applied has not received any advances under the Credit Agreement as of this time.

"We believe the long-term outlook for Applied Materials is excellent and we are confident in our strategy. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flows enable us to invest in our future business, pursue strategic opportunities, repurchase shares and pay quarterly dividends."
Applied executed its accelerated stock buyback with Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 6, 2006  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has agreed to purchase the assets of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks Automation, Inc., for $125 million in cash. Brooks Software is a leading provider of factory management and control software to the semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Brooks Software's products complement Applied Materials' existing software applications and are expected to enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) solution for optimizing fab operations.
"Factory management software is essential to the efficient running of today's advanced manufacturing facilities," said Manfred Kerschbaum, senior vice president and general manager of Applied Global Services. "The combination of both companies' software applications and Applied's strong service capabilities will allow us to create a powerful, pre-integrated CIM solution that can be rapidly deployed and continuously supported across the entire lifecycle of a factory. This can be a very attractive alternative to the costly, highly-customized solutions currently available to customers."
After the close of this transaction, the Brooks Software business and employees will be integrated within the Applied Global Services organization. Applied's current factory control software portfolio includes its FAB300
, NeXus
and WorkStream
products, which have been successfully developed with industry-leading customers and are being used in fabs around the world. The acquisition of Brooks Software will bring several new world-class applications to Applied, including the scheduling-dispatching, material control system (MCS) and advanced process control (APC) segments of the CIM environment, which are all critical to fab operational efficiency. The acquisition is subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Applied's anticipated acquisition of Brooks Automation's Brooks Software business and expected benefits of the transaction, including technology leadership and improved product capabilities. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied, including but not limited to: the satisfaction of closing conditions; the successful integration and performance of the acquired business; sustainability of demand in the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, which is subject to many factors, including global economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, demand for electronic products and integrated circuits, and geopolitical uncertainties; Applied's ability to develop, deliver and support a broad range of products and to expand its markets and develop new markets; retention of key employees; the ability to realize synergies expected to result from the acquisition; unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and other risks described in Applied Materials' Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and Applied Materials assumes no obligation to update any such statement.

"We expanded our product offerings, extending our flat panel display systems for Generation 8.5 manufacturing and launching our strategy for solar technology. We also returned value to stockholders by reducing outstanding shares by 10 percent, primarily through our accelerated stock buyback."
     After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the fourth quarter and, as a result, is reporting four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. The Silicon segment manufactures and sells equipment to fabricate semiconductor
 
chips. The Fab Solutions segment offers a broad range of products to maintain, service and optimize customers' semiconductor fabs, including total parts management, spare parts, remanufactured equipment, maintenance agreements, total support programs, and environmental and software solutions. The Display segment manufactures, sells and services equipment used to make flat panel displays. The Adjacent Technologies segment manufactures, sells and services equipment used to fabricate solar photovoltaic cells, flexible electronics and energy-efficient glass. Net sales by reportable segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were: Silicon, $1.61 billion; Fab Solutions, $590 million; Display, $296 million; and Adjacent Technologies, $20 million.
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the company repurchased 154 million shares of common stock at an average price of $17.15 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2.64 billion, and paid $77 million in dividends.
     The company also announced its results for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2006. Fiscal 2006 new orders were $9.89 billion, a 55 percent increase from $6.39 billion for fiscal 2005. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $9.17 billion, a 31 percent increase from $6.99 billion for fiscal 2005. Net income for fiscal 2006 was $1.52 billion, or $0.97 per diluted share, up from $1.21 billion, or $0.73 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2006 fourth quarter and annual results, along with its outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied Materials' web site.
     This press release includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), consisting of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes that these measures are useful to investors because they enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions, (iii) in-process research and development charges associated with the Applied Films acquisition, (iv) asset impairment and restructuring activities, and (v) resolution of income tax audits. These financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported net income and reported EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.

(2) For nominations of persons for election to the board of directors or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary, and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day, nor later than the close of business on the 75th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of any annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than thirty (30) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the close of business on the 75th day prior to such annual meeting and (b) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which

For purposes of these bylaws, the term "beneficial owner" and "beneficial ownership" shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in Rule 13d-3 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall be determined in accordance with such rule.
(3) In the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the corporation's nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least 75 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new seats on the board of directors created by such increase, if it is delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the close of business on the 75th day prior to such special meeting and (b) the close of business on the

(C)
General.
(1) The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 and, if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.5, to declare that such non-compliant proposal or nomination be disregarded.
(2) For purposes of this Section 2.5, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in any periodic or current report of the corporation filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(3) Nothing in these bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of a stockholder to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given (including without limitation by a form of electronic transmission in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware) shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

Except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority of such quorum shall be deemed the act of the stockholders. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting (except as otherwise provided by Section 2.8 of these bylaws or the General Corporation Law of Delaware), until a quorum is present or represented.

2.7
Quorum
 
. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

If authorized by the board of directors, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.11
Waiver of Notice

. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after one year from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.
2.13
Proxies
. The board of directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives, to act at the meetings of stockholders and make a written report thereof.

. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
3.9
Waiver of Notice
. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

Item 5.02. Departures of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) As announced by Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") on August 15, 2006, Nancy H. Handel, Applied's Senior Vice President, Finance and former Chief Financial Officer, will retire effective January 5, 2007. On December 15, 2006, Applied entered into a formal separation agreement (the "Agreement") with Ms. Handel. If Ms. Handel does not revoke her consent to the Agreement, it will become effective seven days following December 15, 2006.
Under the Agreement, Ms. Handel will continue as an employee of Applied as Senior Vice President, Finance, and will continue receiving her current salary through January 5, 2007. Ms. Handel will provide such other services and cooperate with Applied to facilitate the transition of her duties and responsibilities. Pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into simultaneously with the Agreement, Ms. Handel will provide consulting services of up to five days per month during the period from January 6, 2007 through January 6, 2008 and will be entitled to receive a fee of $10,000 per month for such services.
In connection with Ms. Handel's entrance into the Agreement in anticipation of her retirement, Ms. Handel will receive $687,500 on each of December 15, 2006 (or, if later, within two business days following the date the Agreement becomes effective) and January 5, 2007, provided that she continues to provide the requested services through January 5, 2007. In addition, on December 22, 2006 (or, if later, within two business days following the date the Agreement becomes effective), Ms. Handel will receive a lump sum payment of $692,010, the amount she earned under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan.
As of Ms. Handel's January 5, 2007 retirement date, she will cease to vest in any performance shares she holds, and the unvested performance shares will terminate. As of her retirement date, Ms. Handel will receive the same accelerated vesting on her outstanding stock options that she would have received under the terms of Applied's equity plans and the applicable option agreements had she retired with her current years of service but at an age of 60. As a result, on Ms. Handel's retirement date, 100% of the shares subject to her outstanding options that would have vested had she continued employment through January 31, 2008 will immediately vest, and 50% of the shares subject to her options that would have vested had she continued employment from February 1, 2008 through January 31, 2009 will immediately vest. In addition, all of Ms. Handel's outstanding options will remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the applicable option's maximum term or (ii) December 31, 2007.
The Agreement provides a general release in favor of Applied, as well as continued confidentiality and non-disparagement obligations by Ms. Handel.
Ms. Handel will be eligible to participate in Applied's Bridge to Medicare Plan as provided under, and in accordance with, the terms of the plan applicable to Applied's other employees. Ms. Handel also will be eligible to elect continued health care coverage in accordance with COBRA.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 26, 2007, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into a five-year U.S. $1,000,000,000 Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") with Citicorp USA, Inc. ("Citicorp") as Administrative Agent; The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ("BTMU") as Syndication Agent; and 10 other lenders named therein headquartered in the U.S., China and Singapore (collectively, the "lenders").
The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings (advances) not to exceed U.S. $1,000,000,000 at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus a margin as applicable. The Credit Agreement also requires Applied to pay certain fees and expenses customary for these types of facilities. Applied may repay advances and may re-borrow under the Credit Agreement. Advances under the Credit Agreement will be unsecured.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type. The Credit Agreement also requires maintenance of a funded-debt-to-adjusted-earnings ratio. A default under the Credit Agreement may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with covenants, a failure to pay certain financial obligations, or an acceleration of certain debt obligations. A default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to advance funds to Applied and would require repayment of any outstanding amounts due under the Credit Agreement.
Applied expects to use any advances under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on January 26, 2012, at which time all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement, if any, will become due and payable.
The Credit Agreement replaces a $100,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement dated September 14, 2006 between Applied and Citicorp (the "2006 Agreement"), described further below.
Citicorp, BTMU and certain other lenders or their affiliates have engaged in, and/or in the future may engage in, banking and other transactions with Applied, including previous credit facilities. These parties have received, and/or in the future may receive compensation from Applied for these services.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As discussed under Item 1.01 above, the 2006 Agreement, which was scheduled to expire on September 16, 2007, was terminated as of January 26, 2007 and replaced by the Credit Agreement. Applied received no advances under the 2006 Agreement. The 2006 Agreement is described in Applied's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 15, 2006 (File No. 000-06920), and such description is incorporated herein by this reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
As discussed under Item 1.01 above, on January 26, 2007, Applied entered into the Credit Agreement. The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference. Applied has not received any advances under the Credit Agreement as of this date.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Senior Executive Bonus Plan - Fiscal Year 2007 Performance Goals
On January 23, 2007, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied approved performance goals and a bonus formula under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") that will be used to calculate bonus awards for Applied's named executive officers for fiscal 2007.
As set forth in the Bonus Plan, which was most recently approved by Applied's stockholders at the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Committee may choose from a range of specified and defined performance measures in setting the performance goals.
For Michael R. Splinter, President and Chief Executive Officer, the Committee chose three primary measures: Applied's earnings per share (weighted at 50%), annual revenue growth of Applied relative to its major competitors (weighted at 25%), and certain strategic goals (weighted at 25%), including entry into new markets, and strong operational and financial performance.
For George S. Davis, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the Committee chose two primary measures (each weighted at 50%): Applied's earnings per share and certain strategic goals, including revenue targets for Applied and for particular business units.
For Franz Janker, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, the Committee chose two primary measures (each weighted at 50%): certain company-wide strategic goals, including annual revenue growth of Applied relative to its major competitors, and certain business-unit-specific strategic goals, including revenue growth and growth of new orders.
For Farhad Moghadam, Senior Vice President, General Manager Thin Films Product Business Group and Foundation Engineering, the Committee chose two primary measures (each weighted at 50%): certain company-wide strategic goals, including annual revenue growth of Applied relative to its major competitors, and certain business-unit-specific strategic goals, including revenue growth, growth of new orders and improvements in operational performance.
For Thomas St. Dennis, Senior Vice President, General Manager Etch, Cleans, Front End and Implant Product Business Groups, the Committee chose two primary measures (each weighted at 50%): certain company-wide strategic goals, including annual revenue growth of Applied relative to its major competitors, and certain business-unit-specific strategic goals, including revenue growth, growth of new orders and improvements in operational performance.
The bonus formula also considers Applied's total shareholder return relative to the peer group described below under the section entitled "," and if results are above the 55th percentile position, additional bonus amounts may be earned to the extent that the actual level of total shareholder return exceeds this threshold. Even if the goals described above are achieved, no bonus will be paid under the Bonus Plan unless Applied achieves a specified level of profit after tax. The bonus to Mr. Splinter under the Bonus Plan could range from zero to 525% of his annual base salary. The bonus for the other named executive officers could range from zero to 375% of annual base salary, depending on the officer. However, no bonus paid under the Bonus Plan to any individual may exceed $5 million. For all of the officers, the maximum bonus will be payable only if actual performance significantly exceeds all targeted goals and total shareholder return is above the 55
Employee Stock Incentive Plan  Performance-Based Equity Awards
th
percentile in the above-mentioned peer group.
The actual bonuses paid (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals described above. Extraordinary, non-recurring items generally will be excluded when determining actual performance, unless otherwise determined by the Committee during its regular review of actual performance compared to the specified goals. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the bonus that otherwise would be payable under the Bonus Plan based on actual performance. An executive must remain an employee for all of fiscal year 2007 in order to be eligible for any bonus under the Bonus Plan.
Employee Stock Incentive Plan - Performance-Based Equity Awards
On January 25, 2007, the Committee approved new grants of equity awards for Applied's named executive officers. These awards will vest only if specific performance goals set by the Committee are achieved. The goals require the achievement of specified levels of Applied's annual operating profit relative to the operating profit performance of certain other companies and also that the officer remain an employee of Applied through the vesting date. The awards will not vest if the performance goals are not achieved, even if the officer otherwise remains an employee of Applied. The following sets forth the maximum number of shares that may be earned under these grants:
 
All of the above awards are in the form of performance shares (also sometimes referred to as restricted stock units) except that 30% of Mr. Splinter's award will be in the form of shares of restricted stock. Performance shares and shares of restricted stock are similar, except that performance shares are awards that are paid in shares of Applied common stock once the applicable vesting criteria have been met, while restricted stock consists of shares of Applied common stock that are issued promptly after the grant date but are subject to forfeiture if the applicable vesting criteria are not met. All of the awards were granted under the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") that has been approved by stockholders, and all awards are subject to standard forms of agreement under the Incentive Plan.
Vesting of the awards depends on Applied's annual operating profit performance as compared to operating profit performance by a group of Applied's peer companies. The peer group consists of more than twenty major companies in the high technology industry with which Applied competes for executive talent. The Committee previously selected the peer group for purposes of benchmarking Applied's executive and non-employee director compensation.
Beginning with fiscal 2007, Applied's annual operating profit will be measured each fiscal year for four consecutive years. The awards may vest in full only if Applied's operating profit results in Applied achieving a ranking at or above the 65
th
percentile of operating profit for the peer group (the "performance target"). If Applied fully meets or exceeds this performance target for any year within the four year period, the maximum number of shares will become eligible to vest, provided that the officer remains an employee of Applied through December 19, 2010. Assuming that the performance target has been fully satisfied, up to 1/4 of the shares may vest for each year that has elapsed since December 19, 2006. For example, if the performance target were met fully by the end of fiscal 2008, one-half of the shares would vest on December 19, 2008, provided the officer remains an employee of Applied through that date. The remaining shares would vest in equal installments on December 19, 2009 and December 19, 2010, provided the officer remains an employee of Applied through those dates. However, no shares will vest unless the performance target is satisfied, even if the officer remains an employee of Applied.
If the performance target is not fully met but is above a required minimum ranking in a given year within the four year period, a portion of the shares underlying the award will then become eligible to vest in
accordance with the four year vesting period described above. However, for each five percentile position that Applied is below the performance target described above, the percentage of shares that will become eligible to vest will be reduced significantly. Specifically, for each five percentile points by which Applied's rank position within the peer group falls short of the performance target described above, the percentage of shares that will become eligible that year to vest will be reduced by 15%. For example, if Applied's percentile rank is only 55th, only 70% of the shares will become eligible that year to vest in accordance with the four year vesting period described above. Moreover, if Applied's operating profit is below a minimum ranking (which is the 40
th
percentile) within the peer group, performance will deemed to have failed for that year and no additional shares will become eligible in that year to vest under the four year vesting period described above. In addition, if there is an operating loss in a given year, performance also will be deemed to have failed for that year, even if Applied's performance ranks above the rest of the peer group. If performance falls below the performance target in a particular year, any shares that did not become eligible to vest due to the under-performance still may become eligible to vest if actual performance meets or exceeds the performance target in subsequent years. However, any shares that have not vested or become eligible to vest by the end of fiscal 2010 will be forfeited on that date (or if earlier, on the date the officer's employment with Applied terminates).

On February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") approved a plan (the "Plan") to cease future development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and close the operations of its Applied Implant Technologies group based in Horsham, England. Applied will continue to supply new and refurbished tools to meet customers' capacity requirements. Comprehensive support for customers, including field support and spare parts, will be provided through the company's Applied Global Services group. The determination was based on management's assessment that the implant equipment business has moved increasingly towards commoditization and that projected financial performance does not warrant further expenditure in next-generation beamline implant products.
Under the Plan, the Company expects to wind down its research and development and manufacturing operations in Horsham to closure by the end of December 2007. Approximately 270 employees located primarily in Horsham will be affected by the closure and, as specified under UK law, the Company will undertake a consultation process before final employment decisions are made.
The total cost of implementing the Plan is expected to be in the range of $90 to $130 million, which will be reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations under cost of products sold and operating expenses (including asset impairment and restructuring charges). Costs are anticipated to be incurred over multiple quarters concluding in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
As part of the total cost indicated above, Applied anticipates that it will record pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges in the range of $45 to $53 million over multiple fiscal quarters, consisting principally of lease termination/facilities-related charges and employee termination charges. Included in the restructuring charges are anticipated cash expenditures in the range of $38 to $43 million. Applied estimates that costs other than restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with the Plan will range between $45 and $77 million, consisting primarily of inventory-related and employee-related charges.
On February 13, 2007, the Company filed a press release announcing the Plan. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the expected charges and future cash expenditures under, and anticipated timing of, the Plan. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to: customer requirements; the results of lease negotiations; retention of key employees; changes in Applied's business requirements; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings. Applied undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 13, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced its intention to cease future development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and close the operations of its Applied Implant Technologies group based in Horsham, England. Applied will continue to supply new and refurbished tools to meet customers' capacity requirements. Comprehensive support for customers, including field support and spare parts, will be provided through the company's Applied Global Services group.
"Our implant business has a long history dating back to the acquisition of Lintott Engineering in 1980," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "Unfortunately, the implant equipment business has changed over the past few years and moved towards commoditization and projected financial performance does not warrant further expenditure in next-generation beamline implant products."
Approximately 270 employees located primarily in Horsham will be affected by the closure, which is expected to be completed by the end of December 2007. Applied expects to record total costs in the range of $90 million to $130 million over the next four fiscal quarters in connection with this plan.
"We appreciate the dedication and efforts of our Implant employees and thank them for their contribution to our company," said Splinter. "We are fully committed to supporting our implant customers around the world as we work through this plan."
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the expected costs and anticipated timing of the exit activities. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and include the assumptions that underlie such statements.

Exhibit 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 13, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended January 28, 2007. Net sales were $2.28 billion, up 23 percent from $1.86 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and down 10 percent from $2.52 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was 46.7 percent, up from 45.1 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and down from 47.1 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $403 million, or $0.29 per share, up from net income of $143 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and down from net income of $449 million, or $0.30 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
     New orders of $2.54 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 24 percent from $2.04 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and decreased 6 percent from $2.69 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The decline in orders for the first quarter reflected a significant decrease in Display orders as customers delayed their capacity expansion plans. This decline was partially offset by record Fab Solutions orders and increased Silicon orders. Regional distribution of new orders for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was: Taiwan 24 percent, North America 22 percent, Korea 19 percent, Europe 13 percent, Japan 12 percent, and Southeast Asia and China 10 percent. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $3.55 billion, compared to $3.40 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
     "We executed effectively and met our operational objectives for the quarter," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "Rapid customer acceptance of our new leading-edge platforms for chemical vapor deposition and metal etch, as well as strong demand for Applied's service products, set the stage for future growth."
     Results by reportable segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
 
Applied Materials, Inc. February 13, 2007 Page 2 of 5
     Non-GAAP net income was $405 million, or $0.29 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Applied believes that these measures are useful to investors because they enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions, (iii) resolution of income tax audits and retroactive reinstatement of tax credits, and (iv) asset impairment and restructuring activities. These financial measures may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported net income and reported EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
     This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the company's performance, technology leadership, strategic position and future growth. Forward-looking statements may contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "may," "should," "will," "estimate," "forecast," "continue" or similar expressions, and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the sustainability of demand in the nanomanufacturing technology industry and broadening of demand for emerging applications such as solar, which are subject to many factors, including global economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, demand for electronic products and semiconductors, and geopolitical uncertainties; customers' capacity requirements, including capacity utilizing the latest technology; the timing, rate, amount and sustainability of capital spending for new nanomanufacturing technology products; the company's ability to successfully develop, deliver and support a broad range of products and to expand its markets and develop new markets; the successful integration and performance of acquired businesses; the effectiveness of joint ventures; retention of key employees; the company's ability to maintain effective cost controls and to timely align its cost structure with business conditions; the company's ability to effectively manage its resources and production capability, including its supply chain; and other risks described in Applied Materials' Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2007 first quarter results, along with its outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied Materials' web site.

Exhibit 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 15, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended April 29, 2007. Net sales were $2.53 billion, up 13 percent from $2.25 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and up 11 percent from $2.28 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was 44.9 percent, down from 46.5 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and down from 46.7 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $411 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to net income of $413 million, or $0.26 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and compared to net income of $403 million, or $0.29 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Current quarter results reflected charges related to the previously announced decision to cease development of beamline implant products and certain charges associated with the acquisition of the software division of Brooks Automation, Inc.
     Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $509 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $457 million, or $0.29 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $405 million, or $0.29 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained further below and detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results.
     "Applied Materials delivered higher than expected revenue and earnings this quarter," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "We demonstrated our ability to execute across our business lines, deliver enhanced operational performance and open new opportunities for growth, announcing our first contracts for solar cell production lines. While the market for Display remained soft, Silicon and Fab Solutions exceeded expectations fueled by continued high levels of memory investment and momentum from market share gains."
     New orders of $2.65 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 6 percent from $2.49 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and increased 4 percent from $2.54 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Regional distribution of new orders for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was: Taiwan 30 percent, North America 15 percent, Korea 15 percent, Southeast Asia and China 15 percent, Japan 14 percent and Europe 11 percent. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $3.67 billion, compared to $3.55 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
     Results by reportable segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
 
     Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) asset impairment and restructuring activities, (iii) ceasing development of beamline implant products, (iv) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and an in-process research and development charge, and (v) the resolution of income tax audits and retroactive reinstatement of tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies.

Forward-looking statements may contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "may," "should," "will," "estimate," "forecast," "continue" or similar expressions, and include the assumptions that underlie such statements.

On June 25, 2007, Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Applied or the Company) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with all of the shareholders of HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT), a privately-held company incorporated in Switzerland, to purchase all of the outstanding shares (the Shares) of HCT. HCT is the world's leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in manufacturing crystalline silicon substrates for the solar industry. Upon the closing of the share purchase contemplated by the Agreement, HCT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
Applied will pay the aggregate sum of approximately CHF 583 million (or approximately US$475 million at the current exchange rate) in cash for the Shares.
A portion of the consideration will be placed in an indemnity escrow account for a period of one year to satisfy certain indemnity obligations that may accrue, if any. A separate portion of the consideration payable to two management sellers will be placed in a deferral escrow account, payment of which is conditioned on the continued employment of such sellers with Applied or its affiliates (including HCT) for a specified period of time after the closing.
Applied and the sellers have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement, and the Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Applied and sellers.
Closing of the share purchase contemplated by the Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals.
 
On June 26, 2007, Applied issued a press release announcing execution of the Agreement, the text of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit, is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Applied Materials under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 26, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has agreed to acquire HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT), a privately-held company based in Switzerland. HCT is the world's leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in manufacturing crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates for the solar industry. Under terms of the agreement, Applied will pay approximately CHF 583 million (or approximately US$475 million at the current exchange rate) in cash for all of the outstanding shares of HCT. The acquisition is part of Applied's strategy to accelerate customers' ability to reduce the costs of photovoltaic (PV) cell manufacturing to make solar energy more competitive with grid electricity.
"This acquisition aligns well with our overall strategy to drive down the cost-per-watt of solar power for c-Si and thin film applications," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "HCT will significantly expand our opportunities in the c-Si PV technology sector, which currently comprises 90% of solar panel production. By combining HCT's precision wafering systems with Applied's strong manufacturing technology and global support infrastructure, we believe we can take solar wafer manufacturing to the next level of production efficiency."
HCT is a pioneer in precision wafering, with technology that also includes products for squaring and cropping ingots and for slurry recovery. After a silicon ingot is formed, HCT's wafering systems exactly section it into thin substrates for subsequent use in fabricating c-Si solar cells. As a result of the substantial expansion of the solar industry, HCT has recently experienced rapid growth, supplying its products to c-Si solar manufacturers worldwide.
Currently, one of the major challenges in manufacturing solar cells is the cost and supply of the raw silicon material. In c-Si manufacturing, HCT's precision wafering systems enable customers to significantly reduce the thickness of wafers used to make c-Si solar cells, decreasing silicon usage. In addition, Applied's products for thin film solar cell manufacturing reduce silicon utilization by forming atomically thin layers of silicon directly from gases onto a glass substrate.
"Our overall solar strategy is to reduce cost-per-watt, and for c-Si, the grams of silicon-per-watt' is key to this equation," commented Dr. Mark Pinto, senior vice president and general manager of Applied's New Business and New Products Group. "HCT's technology and roadmap to reduce wafer thickness are critical to improving material utilization and will complement our high throughput c-Si ATON deposition system, enabling customers to scale up production and reduce cost."
Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals. The parties expect to close the transaction during Applied's fourth fiscal quarter of 2007.

Applied Materials, Inc. (the "Company") established the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDCP"), effective as of January 1, 2005, to provide certain unfunded deferred compensation benefits to a select group of management and highly-compensated employees of the Company and its participating affiliates, which group includes the Company's named executive officers. The EDCP is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable guidance issued under that section. Employees of the Company and its participating affiliates who hold positions at the level of Managing Director or above are eligible to participate in the EDCP. The EDCP is administered on behalf of the Company by a committee comprised of employees who hold titles and/or positions specified under the EDCP and who do not report directly to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
The EDCP allows an eligible employee to defer part of his or her base salary and/or all or part of his or her eligible bonus (if any) on a pre-tax basis. On July 11, 2007, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") approved an amendment to the EDCP. The amendment permits an EDCP participant to also defer on a pre-tax basis all or part of any cash severance payment(s) that may become payable to him or her after his or her separation from service in accordance with the terms of a severance agreement that is the subject of bona fide, arm's-length negotiations between the Company and the participant at the time of the separation from service. The Company does not make matching or any other type of employer contributions under the EDCP.
Compensation deferrals made by each participant under the EDCP are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of the participant, and each account balance is credited with deemed interest at the end of each pay period during the plan year (that is, the calendar year) at a rate equal to 1/26
th
of the "Deferral Interest Rate" for the year. The "Deferral Interest Rate" for a plan year is the sum of (1) the yield-to-maturity of five-year U.S. Treasury notes as of the first business day of the December immediately preceding the plan year, plus (2) 1.5%. EDCP account balances are always 100% vested.
A participant's EDCP account balances generally are distributed upon the date(s) elected by the participant in accordance with the terms of the EDCP. Distributed amounts are paid in the form of a lump sum cash payment or a fixed number of annual cash installment payments (not to exceed 10) as elected by the participant in accordance with the terms of the EDCP, subject to certain exceptions as provided in the EDCP, such as death, disability, a separation from service, a change in control or in-service withdrawals due to extreme financial hardship. Distributed amounts generally are included in a participant's gross income and reported in the year(s) in which they are distributed to the participant. The EDCP may be amended by the Committee at any time at its sole discretion in accordance with applicable law.

the Participant's inability to perform the duties of his or her position or any substantially similar position, where such impairment can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months. The Committee will determine whether or not a Participant has incurred an Eligible Disability based on such evidence as the Committee deems necessary or advisable.
2.2.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's election to make Compensation Deferrals under Section 2.1 will be irrevocable as to amounts already deferred as of the effective date of any cancellation in accordance with this Section 2.2.
Irrevocability of Prior Compensation Deferrals.
2.2.5 A Participant whose Compensation Deferrals have been cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.2 may later resume making Compensation Deferrals under the Plan only in accordance with Section 2.1.3.
Resumption of Compensation Deferrals.
2.3 An individual who has become a Participant in the Plan will remain a Participant until his or her entire Account balance has been distributed. However, an Eligible Employee who has become a Participant may or may not be an active Participant making Compensation Deferrals for a particular Plan Year, depending upon whether he or she has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for such Plan Year.
Termination of Participation.
3.1 At the times and in the manner prescribed in Section 2.1, each Eligible Employee may elect to defer portions of his or her Compensation and to have the amounts of such Compensation Deferrals credited to his or her Account, as follows:
Compensation Deferrals.
(a) For the 2005 Plan Year only, an Eligible Employee may elect to defer an amount equal to any whole percentage or any specific dollar amount (in $1,000 increments) of the Participant's Compensation, provided that any percentage elected by the Participant will be not less than 5% of his or her Base Salary or Eligible Bonus (as the case may be), and any dollar amount elected will be not less than $5,000. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or any contrary provision of the Plan, (i) a Participant's Compensation Deferrals may be taken only from that portion of his or her Compensation that exceeds the 401(k) Base, and (ii) the Committee may reduce a Participant's Compensation Deferrals to the extent necessary to satisfy applicable withholding tax requirements and employee welfare plan and other deductions.
2005 Plan Year.
(b) For each Plan Year thereafter, an Eligible Employee may elect to make (i) a Base Salary deferral in an amount equal to any specific dollar amount (in $1,000 increments) or one hundred percent (100%) of his or her expected Base Salary above the 401(k) Base for the Plan Year, provided, however, that any dollar amount elected by the Participant may be not less than $5,000; and/or (ii) an Eligible Bonus deferral in an amount equal to any whole percentage of his or her Bonus (if any), provided, however, that the percentage elected by the Participant may be not less than five percent (5%) nor more than one hundred percent (100%).
Subsequent Plan Years.
 
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Committee may reduce a Participant's Compensation Deferrals to the extent necessary to satisfy applicable withholding tax requirements and employee welfare plan and other deductions.
3.2  The amounts deferred pursuant to Section 3.1 will reduce the Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year and will be credited to the Participant's Account as of the last day of the month in which the amounts (but for the Compensation Deferral) would have been paid to the Participant. For each Plan Year, the exact dollar amount to be deferred from each Compensation payment will be determined by the Committee under such formulae as it adopts from time to time.
Crediting of Compensation Deferrals
.
3.3  Subject to the provisions of Section 5, each Participant must indicate on his or her Compensation Deferral election made under Section 3.1 the form of payment for the Compensation Deferrals (and deemed interest thereon) made pursuant to such election. A Participant may elect (a) a single lump sum cash payment, (b) five (5) substantially equal annual cash installment payments, or (c) ten (10) substantially equal annual cash installment payments. A Participant's election as to the form of payment will apply to all Compensation Deferrals credited to the Participant's Account with respect to which the election is made, and except to the limited extent provided in Section 3.5, will be irrevocable.
Form of Payment.
3.4  Subject to the provisions of Section 5, each Participant must indicate on his or her Compensation Deferral election made under Section 3.1 the time for payment for the Compensation Deferrals (and deemed interest thereon) made pursuant to such election. Pursuant to such procedures as the Committee (in its discretion) may adopt from time to time, a Participant may elect a term of deferral equal to any whole number of calendar years (not less than one) specified in his or her Compensation Deferral election or the occurrence of a specific event (for example, the attainment of age 50), provided that any such election satisfies the requirements of section 409A of the Code. The procedures adopted by the Committee may (in the discretion of the Committee) restrict a Participant's ability to elect multiple terms of deferral under the Plan. A Participant's election as to the term of deferral will apply to all Compensation Deferrals credited to the Participant's Account with respect to which the election is made, and except to the limited extent provided in Section 3.5, will be irrevocable.
Term of Deferral
.
3.5 Subject to the provisions of Section 5, a Participant may change his or her election under Section 3.3 and/or Section 3.4 for Compensation Deferrals credited to the Participant's Account and make a new election (a "Subsequent Deferral Election"), provided that the following requirements (the "Subsequent Deferral Requirements") are met: (a) the Subsequent Deferral Election will not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the Election is made; (b) the Subsequent Deferral Election is made not less than twelve (12) months before the date payment of such amounts was previously scheduled to be made or commenced, (c) the newly-elected scheduled payment commencement date is at least five (5) years after the date payment of such amounts was previously scheduled to be made or commenced, and (d) payment of such amounts has not actually commenced. For example, if a Participant initially elected to receive his or her 2005 Plan Year Compensation Deferrals (and deemed interest thereon) in the form of five (5) substantially equal
Changes in Elections as to Form of Payment and/or Term of Deferral
. 
 
annual cash installment payments, with the first installment payable on July 1, 2008, the Participant instead may elect to receive payment of such amounts in the form of a single lump sum cash payment, provided that such Subsequent Deferral Election is made on or before June 30, 2007 (that is, not less twelve (12) months before the date on which payment of such amounts previously was scheduled to commence) and the newly-elected scheduled payment date is July 1, 2013 or later (that is, at least five (5) years after the date payment of such amounts was previously scheduled to commence). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with Treasury regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(8) the Subsequent Deferral Requirements will be deemed to be satisfied to the extent the Committee (in its discretion) provides a Participant with a Subsequent Deferral Election to satisfy the requirements of USERRA (as defined in Section 2.1.6), if applicable.
3.6 Effective as of July 11, 2007, and notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision:
Eligible Separation Payment(s).
(a) A Participant may elect to defer any specific dollar amount (in $1,000 increments) or one hundred percent (100%) of his or her Eligible Separation Payment(s) in the manner and at such time as is permitted by the Committee, provided that such election is made before the deadline specified in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-2(a)(11). The amount deferred by the Participant pursuant to this Section 3.6 ("Separation Pay Deferral") will reduce the Participant's Eligible Separation Payment and will be credited to the Participant's Account as of the day on which the amount (but for the Separation Pay Deferral) would have been paid to the Participant.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the Participant must indicate on his or her Separation Pay Deferral election made pursuant to this Section 3.6 the form of payment for the Separation Pay Deferral (and deemed interest thereon). The Participant may elect (i) a single lump sum cash payment, (ii) five (5) substantially equal annual cash installment payments, or (iii) ten (10) substantially equal annual cash installment payments. A Participant's election as to the form of payment of his or her Separation Pay Deferral (and deemed interest thereon) will be irrevocable.
3.7  Each Participant's Account will be credited with deemed interest as of the end of each pay period. The rate for crediting deemed interest as of the end of any pay period will be equal to one twenty-sixth (1/26th) of the "Deferral Interest Rate" for that Plan Year. The Deferral Interest Rate for a particular Plan Year will apply to all amounts then credited to the Participant's Account, without regard to when the amounts originally were credited to the Account. The Deferral Interest Rate for a particular Plan Year is the sum of (a) the yield-to-maturity of five-year U.S. Treasury notes as of the first business day of the December immediately preceding such Plan Year, plus (b) 1.50%. The exact amount to be credited as deemed interest to any Participant's Account will be determined by the Committee under such formulae (consistent with this Section 3.7) as the Committee, in its discretion, adopts from time to time.
Deemed Interest on Accounts
.
 
4.1 . For each Plan Year, at the direction of the Committee, there will be established and maintained on the books of the Company, a separate Account or Accounts for each Participant to which will be credited all Compensation Deferrals made by the Participant during such Plan Year and deemed interest on such amounts. Effective as of July 11, 2007, at the direction of the Committee, there also will be established and maintained on the books of the Company a separate Account or Accounts ("Separation Pay Account(s)") to which will be credited any Separation Pay Deferrals (as defined in Section 3.6) made by the Participant pursuant to his or her election under Section 3.6 and deemed interest on such amounts.
Participants' Accounts
4.2 . All amounts credited to a Participant's Account under the Plan will continue for all purposes to be a part of the general assets of the Employer. Each Participant's interest in the Plan will make him or her only a general, unsecured creditor of the Employer. In the event that an Employer (other than the Company) becomes insolvent and therefore unable to make a payment or payments owed by it under the Plan, the Company will make such payments; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence will make any Participant anything other than a general, unsecured creditor of the Company.
Participants Remain Unsecured Creditors
4.3 . The accounting methods or formulae to be used under the Plan for the purpose of maintaining the Participants' Accounts, including the calculation and crediting of deemed interest, will be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. The accounting methods or formulae selected by the Committee may be revised from time to time.
Accounting Methods
4.4 . Each Participant will be furnished with periodic statements of his or her Account, reflecting the status of his or her interest in the Plan, at least annually.
Reports
5.1 . Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5 below, a distribution of the balance credited to a Participant's Account will be made or commenced on the Payment Date that immediately follows the end of the term of deferral(s) elected by the Participant under Section 3.4 or 3.5 (as applicable) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, and in the form elected by the Participant under Section 3.3 or 3.5 (as applicable), in accordance with the following rules. If the Participant elected to receive annual cash installment payments, his or her first installment will be equal to the balance then credited to his or her Account, divided by the number of installments to be made. Each subsequent annual installment will be paid to the Participant on each anniversary of the first installment payment or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will be equal to the balance then credited to the Participant's Account, divided by the number of installments remaining to be paid. While a Participant's Account is in installment payout status, the unpaid balance credited to the Account will continue to be credited with deemed interest under Section 3.7.
Normal Time for Distribution
 
5.2 . Effective as of July 11, 2007, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 5 below, a distribution of the balance credited to a Participant's Separation Pay Account (as defined in Section 4.1) will be made or commenced on the Payment Date that immediately follows the one-year anniversary of the date on which the applicable Separation Pay Deferral amount was credited to the Account or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, in accordance with the following rules. If the Participant elected to receive annual cash installment payments, his or her first installment will be equal to the balance then credited to his or her Separation Pay Account, divided by the number of installments to be made. Each subsequent annual installment will be paid to the Participant on each anniversary of the first installment payment or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will be equal to the balance then credited to the Participant's Separation Pay Account, divided by the number of installments remaining to be paid. While a Participant's Separation Pay Account is in installment payout status, the unpaid balance credited to the Account will continue to be credited with deemed interest under Section 3.7.
Separation Pay Deferrals
5.3 . If there is a Change in Control Event, the balance then credited to a Participant's Account will be distributed to him or her in a single lump sum cash payment on the Payment Date that immediately follows the date of the Change in Control Event or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. The Company will reimburse the Participant for any reasonable legal fees and expenses that the Participant incurs to enforce his or her distribution rights under the Plan following a Change in Control Event. This reimbursement right will apply only to claims made by the Participant after the Change in Control Event and only for fees and expenses that the Participant incurs after he or she has exhausted the Plan's claims and appeal procedures described in Section 7.4(k). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no reimbursement will be made under this Section 5.2 (a) unless a court of competent jurisdiction or the Company determines that the Participant's claim was at least partially correct, or (b) if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Participant's claim is frivolous.
Special Rule for Change in Control Event
5.4 . If a Participant dies, the balance then credited to his or her Account will be distributed to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum cash payment on the Payment Date that immediately follows the Participant's death or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. However, if a Participant dies without having effectively designated a Beneficiary, or if no Beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant's Account will be payable to his or her surviving spouse, or, if the Participant is not survived by his or her spouse, the Account will be paid to his or her estate.
Special Rule for Death
5.5 . If a Participant becomes Disabled, the balance then credited to his or her Account will be distributed to the Participant in a single lump sum cash payment on the Payment Date that immediately follows the date on which the Participant became Disabled or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
Special Rule for Disability
5.6 . If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service, any balance then credited to the Participant's Account will be distributed or begin to be distributed to the Participant on the Payment Date that immediately follows his or her Separation from Service or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and in the form elected under Section 3.3; provided, however, that if the Participant's Account balance(s) at that time are less than the 401(k) Base in effect at that time, such balance(s) will be distributed in a single lump sum cash payment.
Special Rule for Separation From Service
 
5.7 . Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision and subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4, 5.9.1 and 5.9.2, any payment(s) that are otherwise required to be made under the Plan to a Specified Employee due to his or her Separation from Service will be accumulated during the first six (6) months following the Separation from Service and will instead be paid on the Payment Date that immediately follows the end of such six-month period or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
Required Six-Month Delay in Payment for Specified Employees
5.8 . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of Section 5:
Delay of Payment(s) Permitted Under Certain Circumstances
5.8.1 . Any payment scheduled to be made under the Plan will be delayed to the extent that the Company reasonably anticipates that if the payment were made as scheduled, its deduction with respect to such payment otherwise would not be permitted due to the application of section 162(m) of the Code. Any such delayed payment will be made either (a) during the Participant's first taxable year in which the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction of such payment will not be barred by the application of section 162(m) of the Code, or (b) during the period beginning with the date of the Participant's Separation from Service and ending on the later of (i) the last day of the Company's fiscal year in which the Participant incurs the Separation from Service or (ii) the fifteenth (15
Payments Subject to Section 162(m) of the Code
th
) day of the third month following the Separation from Service. If any such payment is delayed to a date on or after the Participant's Separation from Service, the payment will be considered a payment due to the Participant's Separation from Service for purposes of Section 5.7, and in the case of a Specified Employee, the date that is six (6) months after the Participant's Separation from Service will be substituted for any reference to the Participant's Separation from Service in the immediately preceding sentence. If any scheduled payment to a Participant in the Company's fiscal year is delayed in accordance with this Section 5.8.1, then all scheduled payments to that Participant that could be delayed hereunder also will be delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a distribution of a Participant's Account will be made without regard to the deductibility limitation of section 162(m) of the Code if the time for distribution is accelerated pursuant to Section 5.3, 5.4, or 5.5.
5.8.2 . Any payment scheduled to be made under the Plan will be delayed if the Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law. Any such delayed payment will be made at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation. For this purpose, the making of a payment under the Plan that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code will not be treated as a violation of applicable law.
Payments That Would Violate Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law
 
5.8.3 Any payment scheduled to be made under the Plan will be delayed upon such other events and conditions as may be prescribed in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Other Events and Conditions.
5.8.4 During any delay in payment under this Section 5.8, the unpaid amount will continue to be credited with deemed interest under Section 3.7.
Continued Deemed Interest During Any Delay in Payment.
5.9  Notwithstanding any foregoing provision of Section 5 and except as otherwise provided below:
Acceleration of Payment(s) Permitted Under Certain Circumstances
.
5.9.1 . A Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(iii), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Conflicts of Interest
5.9.2 A Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Payment of Employment Taxes.
5.9.3 Subject to Section 5.7, a Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vii), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Income Inclusion Under Section 409A of the Code.
5.9.4 Subject to Section 5.7, a Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xi), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Payment of State, Local or Foreign Taxes.
5.9.5 Subject to Section 5.7, a Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xiii), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Certain Offsets.
5.9.6 Subject to Section 5.7, a Participant's Account balance may be distributed in an immediate lump sum cash payment to the extent permitted in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xiv), as directed by the Committee (in its discretion).
Bona Fide Disputes as to a Right to a Payment.
5.10  Each Participant may, pursuant to such procedures as the Committee may specify, designate one or more Beneficiaries.
Beneficiary Designations
.
5.10.1 If a Participant designates a person other than or in addition to his or her spouse as a primary Beneficiary, the designation will be ineffective unless the Participant's spouse consents to the designation. Any spousal consent required under this Section 5.10 will be ineffective unless it (a) is set forth in writing in a form specified in the discretion of the Committee, (b) acknowledges the effect of the Participant's designation of another person as
Spousal Consent.
 
his or her Beneficiary under the Plan, and (c) is signed by the spouse and witnessed by an authorized agent of the Committee or a notary public. Notwithstanding this consent requirement, if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Committee that written spousal consent may not be obtained because the spouse cannot be located, his or her designation will be effective without spousal consent. Any spousal consent required under this Section 5.10 will be valid only with respect to the spouse who signs the consent. A Participant may revoke his or her Beneficiary designation at any time, provided that such revocation is in writing.
5.10.2 A Participant may designate different Beneficiaries (or may revoke a prior Beneficiary designation) at any time by delivering a new designation (or revocation of a prior designation) in accordance with Section 5.10.1. Any designation or revocation will be effective only if it is received by the Committee. However, when so received, the designation or revocation will be effective as of the date the notice is executed (whether or not the Participant still is living), but without prejudice to the Committee on account of any payment made before the change is recorded. The last effective designation received by the Committee will supersede all prior designations.
Changes and Failed Designations.
5.11  If a Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that all or part of the Participant's Account balance will be distributed to him or her in a lump sum cash payment on the Payment Date that immediately follows the date on which the Committee determines that the Participant has incurred the Unforeseeable Emergency or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter; provided, however, that the amount paid to the Participant pursuant to this Section 5.11 will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency (which may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the payment). Also, no payment under this Section 5.11 will be made to the extent that the Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by the cancellation of the Participant's Compensation Deferrals in accordance with Section 2.2.2.
Unforeseeable Emergency
.
5.12  If any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is a minor or legally incompetent, the Committee will determine whether payment will be made directly to the individual, any person acting as his or her custodian or legal guardian under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, his or her legal representative or a near relative, or directly for his or her support, maintenance or education.
Payments to Incompetents
.
5.13  Each Participant and (in the event of death) his or her Beneficiary must keep the Committee advised of his or her current address. If the Committee is unable to locate the Participant or Beneficiary to whom a Participant's Account is payable under this Section 5, the Participant's Account will continue to be credited with deemed interest in accordance with Section 3.7. However, Accounts that, in accordance with the preceding sentence, have been undistributable for a period of thirty-five (35) months will be forfeited as of the end of the thirty-fifth month. If a Participant whose Account was forfeited under this Section 5.13 (or his or her Beneficiary) files a claim for distribution of the Account after the date on which it was forfeited, and
Undistributable Accounts
.
 
if the Committee determines that such claim is valid, then the forfeited balance will be paid by the Employer in a single lump sum cash payment as soon as administratively practicable thereafter (without any interest or any deemed interest after the date of forfeiture).
Subject to Sections 8 and 9.2, a Participant's interest in the balance credited to his or her Account at all times will be one hundred percent (100%) vested and nonforfeitable.
7.1  The Company is hereby designated as the administrator of the Plan (within the meaning of section 3(16)(A) of ERISA).
Plan Administrator
.
7.2

.
(a) Effective before December 13, 2005, the Plan will be administered on behalf of the Company by a Committee consisting of one or more members who are appointed by and holding office at the pleasure of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO"). Any member of the Committee may resign at any time by notice in writing mailed or delivered to the CEO. The CEO may remove any member of the Committee at any time and may fill any vacancy which exists.
Before December 13, 2005.
(b) Effective on or after December 13, 2005:
On or After December 13, 2005.
(i) The Plan will be administered on behalf of the Company by a Committee consisting of employees of the Company who hold the following titles or positions ("Specified Positions"):
(1) Corporate Controller;
(2) Corporate Treasurer;
(3) Appointed Vice President, Compensation and Benefits (the "VP, Comp & Benefits");
(4) Senior Director, Treasury, or effective July 3, 2006, Managing Director, Treasury; and

(ii) The VP, Comp & Benefits also may appoint to Committee membership one additional employee of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Committee may be an individual who reports directly to the CEO. The VP, Comp & Benefits also may remove any appointed member of the Committee at any time and may fill any vacancy of appointed members of the Committee that exists.
7.3  The Committee will have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. Each decision of a majority of the members of the Committee then in office will constitute the final and binding act of the Committee. The Committee may act with or without a meeting being called or held and will keep minutes of all meetings held and a record of all actions taken by written consent.
Actions by Committee
.
7.4  The Committee will have all powers and discretion necessary or appropriate to supervise the administration of the Plan and to control its operation in accordance with its terms, including, but not by way of limitation, the following discretionary powers:
Powers of Committee
.
(a) To interpret and determine the meaning and validity of the provisions of the Plan and to determine any question arising under, or in connection with, the administration, operation or validity of the Plan or any amendment thereto;
(b) To determine any and all considerations affecting the eligibility of any employee to become a Participant or remain a Participant in the Plan;
(c) To cause one or more separate Accounts to be maintained for each Participant;
(d) To cause Compensation Deferrals and deemed interest thereon to be credited to Participants' Accounts;

(m) To decide all issues and questions regarding Account balances, and the time, form, manner and amount of distributions to Participants in accordance with the Plan's terms; and
(n) Effective as of July 11, 2007, to cause any Separation Pay Deferrals (as defined in Section 3.6) and deemed interest thereon to be credited to Participants' Accounts.
7.5  All actions, interpretations, and decisions of the Committee (and its delegates) will be conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
Decisions of Committee and its Delegates
.
7.6  All expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan by the Committee, or otherwise, including legal fees and expenses, will be paid and borne by the Employers.
Administrative Expenses
.
7.7  No member of the Committee who is also an employee of an Employer will be excluded from participating in the Plan if otherwise eligible, but he or she will not be entitled, as a member of the Committee, to act or pass upon any matters pertaining specifically to his or her own Account under the Plan.
Eligibility to Participate
.
7.8  Each of the Employers will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee (and its delegates), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including attorneys' fees and amounts paid, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Company), in settlement of any claim) arising out of or resulting from the implementation of a duty, act or decision with respect to the Plan, so long as such duty, act or decision does not involve gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any such individual.
Indemnification
.
All amounts credited to a Participant's Account under the Plan will continue for all purposes to be a part of the general assets of the Employer. The interest of the Participant in his or her Account, including his or her right to a distribution thereof, will be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Employer. In the event that an Employer (other than the Company) becomes
 
insolvent and therefore unable to make a payment or payments owed under the Plan, the Company will make such payment(s); provided, however, that nothing in this sentence will make any Participant anything other than a general, unsecured creditor of the company. Nothing contained in the Plan will give any Participant or Beneficiary any interest in or claim against any specific assets of the Employer.
9.1 The Employers intend to continue the Plan indefinitely, and to maintain each Participant's Account until it is scheduled to be paid to him or her in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. However, the Plan is voluntary on the part of the Employers, and the Employers do not guarantee to continue the Plan. The Company at any time may, by amendment of the Plan, suspend Compensation Deferrals or may discontinue Compensation Deferrals, with or without cause.
Employers' Obligations Limited.
9.2 The HRCC, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, in such manner as it may determine, at any time and for any reason. The Company, in its sole discretion, may seek a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax consequences of the Plan. If such a ruling is sought, the Committee will have the right to adopt such amendments to the Plan, including retroactive amendments, as the Internal Revenue Service may require as a condition to the issuance of such ruling.
Right to Amend or Terminate.
9.3 If the Plan is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, the balances credited to the Accounts of the affected Participants will be distributed to them at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 5, except as provided in Section 9.4.

As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 20, 2007, Farhad Moghadam announced on the same date his intention to resign from Applied. On July 19, 2007, Applied entered into a formal separation agreement and release (the "Agreement") with Dr. Moghadam. If Dr. Moghadam does not revoke the Agreement, it will become effective eight days later. Under the Agreement, Dr. Moghadam's employment with Applied will end on September 1, 2007. The Agreement also provides, among other terms, a general release in favor of Applied, continued confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations by Dr. Moghadam and mutual non-disparagement obligations by Applied and Dr. Moghadam. In addition, the Agreement provides for a non-competition obligation by Dr. Moghadam commencing on September 1, 2007 and continuing through December 31, 2008.
Under the Agreement, Dr. Moghadam is expected to continue as an employee of Applied as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Thin Films Products Business Group and Foundation Engineering and, provided he remains an employee, will continue receiving his current salary through September 1, 2007. During this time, Dr. Moghadam also will continue vesting in his unvested stock options and performance shares in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements.
Assuming compliance with the Agreement, Dr. Moghadam will receive cash severance payments in the aggregate of $1,600,000. Pursuant to the terms of Applied's 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDCP") and to an election Dr. Moghadam previously made under the EDCP, these payments will be credited to his account under the EDCP in three installments as follows: $400,000 on each of September 2, 2007 and March 2, 2008 and $800,000 on December 31, 2008.
The Agreement also provides that in the event Dr. Moghadam timely elects and pays for health insurance coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), Applied will reimburse him for such COBRA coverage payments for a period of up to 18 months after September 1, 2007.
Provided Dr. Moghadam does not revoke the Agreement, as of July 27, 2007, three of Dr. Moghadam's outstanding stock options covering a total of 320,000 shares of Applied common stock will remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of: (a) the one-year anniversary of his termination date; or (b) the expiration of the applicable option's maximum term. These options are not subject to any acceleration of vesting. The exercise periods for Dr. Moghadam's other outstanding stock options will not be extended. Instead, those options will expire 30 days after his termination date, in accordance with the terms of their respective option agreements.
In addition, the Agreement provides for a supplemental agreement and release in favor of Applied (the "Supplemental Agreement"). If Dr. Moghadam enters into the Supplemental Agreement on or within 21 days after his September 1, 2007 termination date and does not revoke it, it will become effective eight days later. In consideration for his entering into and not revoking the Supplemental Agreement, two of Dr. Moghadam's stock options covering a total of 112,500 shares of Applied common stock, and 12,500 performance shares will vest immediately. Once vested, these performance shares will be paid out to Dr. Moghadam in shares of Applied common stock in accordance with their original vesting schedule. The options will expire 30 days after his termination date, in accordance with the terms of their respective option agreements.
Except as otherwise amended by the Agreement, Dr. Moghadam's outstanding stock options and performance shares will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements.

Exhibit 99.1
Release: Immediate
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 14, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its third fiscal quarter ended July 29, 2007. Net sales were $2.56 billion, slightly up from $2.54 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and up from $2.53 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was 47.5 percent, down from 48.1 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and up from 44.9 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $474 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to net income of $512 million, or $0.33 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and compared to net income of $411 million, or $0.29 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
     Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $518 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $543 million, or $0.35 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $509 million, or $0.36 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and further detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
     "Applied Materials delivered on our targets for revenue and profitability this quarter," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "The consolidation of our semiconductor equipment divisions into a single Silicon Systems Group will streamline the company to drive better results to the bottom line.
     "Memory demand drove opportunities for the semiconductor equipment industry and Applied. Conditions in the display industry remained challenging, as customers work to fully utilize existing capacity. We added three contracts for integrated thin film solar production lines to those announced this year, reflecting the expanding market for this technology."
     New orders of $2.28 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased 14 percent from $2.67 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and decreased 14 percent from $2.65 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Regional distribution of new orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was: Taiwan 31 percent, Japan 20 percent, Korea 19 percent, North America 12 percent, Europe 9 percent and Southeast Asia and China 9 percent.

Applied Materials, Inc. August 14, 2007 Page 2 of 6
     Results by reportable segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
     Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) asset impairment and restructuring activities, (iii) ceasing development of beamline implant products, (iv) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and in-process research and development charges, and (v) the resolution of income tax audits and retroactive reinstatement of tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2007 third quarter results, along with its outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied Materials' web site.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 23, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has completed the acquisition of HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT), the world's leading supplier of precision wafering systems for manufacturing crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates for the solar industry. The acquisition expands Applied's portfolio of solutions for helping solar customers reduce the costs of manufacturing photovoltaic (PV) cells to make solar energy more competitive with grid electricity.
Under the terms of the agreement, originally announced on June 26, 2007, Applied paid approximately CHF 583 million (or approximately US$483 million) in cash for all of the outstanding shares of HCT, a privately-held company based in Switzerland.
"This acquisition, combined with our strong production technology and global support infrastructure, will enable us to bring crystalline silicon solar manufacturing to a new level of efficiency and help drive down the cost-per-watt of solar power," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "HCT's technology is critical to our roadmap since it complements our high-throughput deposition systems and will enable customers to scale up production and reduce costs."
HCT is now part of Applied's new Precision Wafering Systems division, operating under the Solar Business Group headed by Charles Gay. Stefan Schneeberger, who has been appointed vice president and general manager of the Precision Wafering Systems division, commented, "We are excited to be part of Applied Materials. Our roadmaps are aligned with the goal of bringing new and advanced manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost of solar energy. Together, we will help customers to continuously reduce the grams of silicon needed per watt, while significantly improving their productivity."
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Applied's acquisition of HCT and expected benefits of the transaction, and Applied's product capabilities and solar strategy. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied, including but not limited to: the successful integration and performance of the acquired business; broadening of demand for emerging applications such as solar, which is subject to many factors, including global economic and market conditions, the cost-effectiveness and performance of PV products compared to other energy sources, technological innovations, availability and cost of polysilicon, evolving industry standards, changing customer and end-user requirements, incentives for alternative energy development, and geopolitical uncertainties; Applied's ability to (i) accurately predict the characteristics of, and capitalize on opportunities in, the PV market, (ii) successfully adapt its existing products and develop and commercialize new products that enable increased solar cell efficiency and lower cost, (iii) recruit, incentivize and retain key employees, (iv) obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies, (v) develop, deliver and support a broad range of products, and (vi) maintain effective cost controls and timely align its cost structure with business conditions; difficulties in production planning and execution; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of August 23, 2007, and Applied undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.

A portion of the consideration will be placed in an escrow account for a period of one year to satisfy certain potential obligations of the sellers. A separate portion of the consideration will be paid on the second anniversary of the closing date (subject to earlier payment in certain instances), conditioned upon specified key employees' continued employment with Applied or its affiliates (including Baccini).
Applied and the sellers have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement, and the Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Applied and the sellers.
Closing of the share purchase contemplated by the Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals.
 
On November 19, 2007, Applied issued a press release announcing execution of the Agreement, the text of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit, is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Applied under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Applied Materials to Accelerate Its Solar Roadmap with Acquisition of Baccini
SANTA CLARA, CA, November 19, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced an agreement to acquire Baccini S.p.A., a leading supplier of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) cells. This integrated equipment set addresses critical processing steps in c-Si solar cell production that significantly affect solar cell efficiency and yield, while enabling the use of ultrathin silicon wafers. Combining Baccini's products and technologies with Applied's semiconductor interconnect processing expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and R&D resources will provide customers with world-class, automated production technology for fabricating advanced c-Si solar cells.
Baccini is a privately-held company founded in 1967 and based in Treviso, Italy. Baccini's product line provides state-of-the-art material handling automation capable of processing wafers less than 120 micrometers thick, which are significantly thinner than those typically used in the industry. Reliable processing of ultrathin wafers is key to next-generation c-Si manufacturing because it will allow customers to minimize the use of silicon material, which now represents more than 60% of solar cell manufacturing cost.
"With this acquisition, Applied will become a leading provider of c-Si cell manufacturing solutions to the PV industry," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "As a key supplier to both the c-Si and thin film solar markets, we are committed to driving down the cost and ramping up the scale of PV manufacturing to make solar energy competitive with grid electricity. We are especially excited by the opportunity to engage in key efforts to meet this challenge in Italy  a country with strong geographic potential for realizing early grid parity."
Under the visionary leadership of its founder and chairman, Gisulfo Baccini, the company has had a strong history of innovation to enable its customers' success, from delivering the PV industry's first integrated metallization line over 20 years ago to its current market-leading portfolio of systems and fully-automated lines for high volume c-Si cell production.
"Baccini and Applied share an enterprising spirit and both have a 40-year history of delivering innovative, highly-efficient and productive products," said Mr. Baccini. "The integration of Baccini's technology with Applied's process, production and manufacturing expertise will provide new capabilities to enable world-class solar solutions for our global customers."
Under the terms of the agreement, Applied will pay 225 million (or approximately US$330 million at the current exchange rate) in cash for all of the outstanding shares of Baccini. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals. The parties expect to close the transaction in early 2008.
Applied Materials will discuss the planned acquisition on a conference call today beginning at 1:30pm Pacific Standard Time. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied's web site at www.appliedmaterials.com and a replay will be available by 5pm Pacific Standard Time.
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Applied Materials' anticipated acquisition of Baccini and expected benefits of the transaction, and Applied's solar strategy, product capabilities and strategic position. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied, including but not limited to: the satisfaction of closing conditions; the successful integration and performance of the acquired business, including realization of backlog; the adequacy of internal controls and processes of the acquired business; demand for PV products, which is subject to many factors, including global economic and market conditions, demand for renewable energy, cost-effectiveness and performance, technological innovations, evolving industry standards, availability of government incentives, the supply and cost of raw materials, and geopolitical uncertainties; the intellectual property rights of market participants; Applied's ability to (i) develop, deliver and support a broad range of products and expand its markets and develop new markets, (ii) obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies, (iii) realize synergies expected to result from the transaction, (iv) commercialize products that enable increased PV efficiency and lower cost, (v) manage its supply chain and production capability, and (vi) recruit, motivate and retain key employees; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of November 19, 2007, and Applied undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.

(e) Senior Executive Bonus PlanFiscal Year 2008 Performance Goals
On January 24, 2008, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved performance goals and a bonus formula under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). The performance goals and the formula will be used to calculate any bonus awards earned for fiscal 2008 for Michael R. Splinter, President and Chief Executive Officer; George S. Davis, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Franz Janker, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Manfred Kerschbaum, Senior Vice President, General Manager Applied Global Services; Mark R. Pinto, Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and General Manager Energy and Environmental Solutions; and Thomas St. Dennis, Senior Vice President, General Manager Silicon Systems Group (the "named executive officers").
As set forth in the Bonus Plan, which most recently was approved by Applied's stockholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Committee may choose from a range of specified and defined performance measures in setting the performance goals.
For Mr. Splinter, the Committee chose three primary measures: (1) Applied's fiscal 2008 adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP, excluding certain non-operating expenses) (weighted at 50%); (2) growth in market share of a specific business (weighted at 25%); and (3) certain operational and strategic objectives relating to a specific business, executive team development, and new business opportunities (collectively weighted at 25%).
For the other named executive officers, the Committee chose Applied's fiscal 2008 corporate scorecard as a component of their bonus formula. Applied's fiscal 2008 corporate scorecard consists of 12 measures relating to: (1) Applied's fiscal 2008 revenue and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP, excluding certain non-operating expenses) (weighted at 10%); (2) market share of a specific business (weighted at 10%); (3) revenue and profitability levels of various businesses (collectively weighted at 20%); (4) growth of a specific business (weighted at 10%); (5) profitability of acquired businesses (weighted at 10%); (6) a multi-year program to enhance business processes and systems (weighted at 10%); (7) market share of specific products (weighted at 5%); (8) manufacturing operations (weighted at 5%); (9) demand for a specific product (weighted at 5%); (10) demand for another specific product (weighted at 5%); (11) energy and environmental initiatives (weighted at 5%); and (12) employee engagement (weighted at 5%).
For Mr. Davis, the Committee chose three primary measures: (1) Applied's fiscal 2008 adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP, excluding certain non-operating expenses) (weighted at 50%); (2) Applied's corporate scorecard (weighted at 25%); and (3) various strategic objectives relating to operating performance, new business, finance organization, and productivity initiatives (collectively weighted at 25%).
For Mr. Janker, the Committee chose two primary measures: (1) Applied's corporate scorecard (weighted at 50%); and (2) various sales- and marketing-related objectives relating to product revenue, market share growth, and demand for certain products (collectively weighted at 50%).
For Mr. Kerschbaum, the Committee chose two primary measures: (1) Applied's corporate scorecard (weighted at 50%); and (2) various business unit-specific goals relating to financial performance, demand for certain products, new products, development of key talent, and product performance (collectively weighted at 50%).
For Dr. Pinto, the Committee chose two primary measures: (1) Applied's corporate scorecard (weighted at 50%); and (2) various business unit-specific goals relating to financial and operating performance, new products, market share growth, and performance of acquired businesses (collectively weighted at 50%).
For Mr. St. Dennis, the Committee chose two primary measures: (1) Applied's corporate scorecard (weighted at 50%); and (2) various business unit-specific goals relating to operating performance, product performance, product revenue, market share growth, organizational performance, and manufacturing operations (collectively weighted at 50%).
Even if the goals described above are achieved, no bonus will be paid under the Bonus Plan unless Applied achieves at least 5% profit after tax. The profit after tax percentage is defined as adjusted net income (non-GAAP, excluding certain non-operating expenses) expressed as a percentage of net sales. The bonus formula also considers Applied's total stockholder return relative to the companies in the S&P 500 and, if total stockholder return for the year is positive and is above the 55th percentile position, additional bonus amounts may be earned to the extent that the actual level of total stockholder return exceeds this threshold.
The bonus for Mr. Splinter under the Bonus Plan could range from zero to 525% of his annual base salary. The bonus for Mr. Kerschbaum under the Bonus Plan could range from zero to 345% of his annual base salary. The bonuses for the other named executive officers could range from zero to 375% of annual base salary. However, no bonus paid under the Bonus Plan to any individual may exceed $5 million. For all of the named executive officers, the maximum bonus will be payable only if actual performance significantly exceeds all targeted goals and total stockholder return is positive and achieves at or above a 90 percentile ranking as compared to the companies in the S&P 500.
th
The actual bonuses paid (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or fails to meet the goals described above. Extraordinary, non-recurring items generally will be excluded when determining actual performance, unless otherwise determined by the Committee during its regular review of actual performance compared to the specified goals. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the amount of the bonus that otherwise would be payable under the Bonus Plan based on actual performance. An executive must remain an employee for all of fiscal 2008 in order to be eligible for any bonus under the Bonus Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Applied Materials Expands its Solar Cell Manufacturing Technologies with Acquisition of Baccini
SANTA CLARA, CA, January 31, 2008  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has acquired Baccini S.p.A., a leading supplier of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) cells. Under the terms of the agreement, Applied paid 225 million (or approximately US$334 million) in cash for all of the outstanding shares of Baccini.
"This acquisition is a key step in our goal to become the leading equipment supplier to the solar industry," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO of Applied Materials. "With our broad portfolio of advanced solar cell manufacturing technologies, we plan to reduce the production costs for both crystalline silicon cell and thin film modules, while also decreasing the grams-per-watt usage of silicon material.

Exhibit 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 12, 2008  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended January 27, 2008. Net sales were $2.09 billion, down 8 percent from $2.28 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and down 12 percent from $2.37 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was 44.8 percent, down from 46.7 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and down from 45.5 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $262 million, or $0.19 per share, down from net income of $403 million, or $0.29 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and down from net income of $422 million, or $0.30 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
     New orders of $2.50 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 2 percent from $2.54 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and increased 13 percent from $2.21 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Regional distribution of new orders for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was: Taiwan 32 percent, North America 20 percent, Korea 14 percent, Japan 12 percent, Southeast Asia and China 11 percent, and Europe 11 percent. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $4.10 billion, compared to $3.65 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
     "We executed well in a challenging global chip equipment market," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "The strength in our new orders reflects robust demand for our display products and recognition of our first Applied SunFab Thin Film Line orders.
     "This is a pivotal year for Applied and we are focused on execution and growth throughout the company. Our long-term prospects are excellent as we build on our foundation of semiconductor equipment and services to add new businesses and move into new markets," concluded Splinter.
     Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $345 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $405 million, or $0.29 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and $472 million or $0.34 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
 
     Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied renamed two of its reportable segments. The Fab Solutions segment is now called Applied Global Services, and the Adjacent Technologies segment is now called Energy and Environmental Solutions. In addition, Applied changed its management reporting system for services, with all service results reported in the Applied Global Services segment. Fiscal 2007 segment information has been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2008.
     Results by reportable segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 were:
     Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) restructuring and asset impairments, (ii) equity-based compensation, (iii) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles and inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, (iv) certain costs associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and/or (v) the resolution of income tax audits and changes in tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2008 first quarter results, along with its outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, on the earnings call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the earnings call will be available at .

Exhibit 99.1
Release: Immediate
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 12, 2008  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its third fiscal quarter ended July 27, 2008. Net sales were $1.85 billion, down 28 percent from $2.56 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and down 14 percent from $2.15 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was 40.2 percent, down from 47.5 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and down from 45.0 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $165 million, or $0.12 per share, down from net income of $474 million, or $0.34 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and down from net income of $303 million, or $0.22 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
     New orders of $2.03 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 11 percent from $2.28 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and decreased 16 percent from $2.41 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Regional distribution of new orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was: Japan 21 percent, North America 19 percent, Korea 17 percent, Southeast Asia and China 17 percent, Europe 16 percent, and Taiwan 10 percent. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $4.74 billion, compared to $4.59 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
     "Applied Materials delivered financial and operational performance that was in line with our quarter forecast during a difficult semiconductor industry environment," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "While our silicon business was down, revenues increased in our display, service and solar businesses. We made significant progress in our solar division during the quarter, substantially increasing the number of crystalline silicon systems shipped and enabling start-up production on the first four SunFab Thin Film lines at customer sites. We are focused on operational execution, and we are taking advantage of opportunities to expand our leadership with next-generation innovations in silicon, display and solar."
     Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $228 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $518 million, or $0.37 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and $362 million or $0.26 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
 
     Results by reportable segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
     Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied changed its management reporting system for services, with all service results reported in the Applied Global Services segment. Fiscal 2007 segment information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation.
     Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles and inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, (iii) restructuring and asset impairments, (iv) certain costs associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and/or (v) the resolution of income tax audits and changes in tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2008 third quarter results, along with its outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, on the earnings call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the earnings call will be available at

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) On September 16, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") approved Amended and Restated Bylaws for the Company (the "Restated Bylaws"), effective immediately. The full text of the Restated Bylaws is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1.
The Restated Bylaws amend the prior bylaws of the Company in the following principal respects:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On September 16, 2008, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of Applied's Board approved certain changes to the compensation of Applied's non-employee directors. These changes implement the recommendations made by Pearl Meyer & Partners, an independent consulting firm, after its review of current trends and practices at leading U.S. companies and other market data relating to non-employee director compensation.
Equity Compensation
The Committee amended certain provisions of the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan that provide for performance share grants to Applied's non-employee directors. The amendment will take effect on October 27, 2008, the first day of Applied's fiscal year 2009.
The amendment provides for a grant of performance shares (also called "restricted stock units") equal to $200,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of Applied's common stock on the grant date (the "Annual Grant"). The Annual Grant automatically will be granted to each of Applied's non-employee directors on the day of the annual meeting of Applied's stockholders (each, an "Annual Meeting"). Directors first appointed at a time other than at the Annual Meeting will receive an initial grant that is pro-rated to reflect the period starting with the day of his or her initial appointment and ending on the day of the Annual Meeting (the "New Director Grant"). This New Director Grant will be granted on the day of a non-employee director's initial appointment.
Prior to the amendment, each non-employee director received 20,000 performance shares upon his or her appointment or election to the Board and an annual grant of 10,000 performance shares on the first business day of the fiscal year following each full fiscal year during which he or she served on the Board.
The vesting schedule for non-employee director performance share awards remains unchanged at 25% on each of the first four (4) annual anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the non-employee director's continued service. Applied also may provide for continuation or acceleration of vesting upon a non-employee director's retirement or disability.
In addition, the Committee increased the stock ownership requirements for non-employee directors who will be required to maintain an investment in Applied stock with a value of at least $300,000 instead of $200,000.
Further, in order to encourage long-term ownership of Applied's common stock, Applied may allow non-employee directors to defer the receipt of shares they would otherwise receive upon vesting of the performance shares.
Retainers and Meeting Fees
In addition, the Committee modified the annual retainer and Board meeting fee structure for non-employee directors. Beginning with fiscal year 2009, non-employee directors will receive an annual retainer of $65,000 but will receive no Board meeting fees. Currently, non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of $40,000 and a fee of $3,000 per Board meeting. Based on the average number of Board meetings held in the past few years, these changes are expected to result in approximately the same level of compensation as that under the current retainer and Board meeting fee structure. The additional retainers for non-employee directors who act as committee chairs and/or as lead independent director will remain the same. The committee meeting fee will remain unchanged at $2,000 per meeting.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day, nor later than the close of business on the 75th day, prior to the first
 
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of any annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than thirty (30) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the 75th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, (b) if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than eighty five (85) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation.

(y) as to any other business (excluding the nomination of a person for election or reelection as a director) that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made (as well as (i) such other information concerning such business and the stockholder proponent as would be required by the appropriate Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the proposal and (ii) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal); and

The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information in addition to that required by paragraph (A)(2)(z) as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
(3) In the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the corporation's nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least eighty-five (85) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new seats on the board of directors created by such increase, if it is delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
 
No business other than that stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders shall be transacted at such special meeting. If the business stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders includes electing one or more directors to the board of directors, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at such special meeting may be made only (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the corporation's notice of meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who gives timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary; clause (2) of this sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations before a special meeting of stockholders. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the 75th day prior to such special meeting or, (b) if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than eighty five (85) days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth the information called for by clauses (x) and (z) of paragraph (A)(2) above.
 
(1) The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 and, if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.5, to declare that such non-compliant proposal or nomination be disregarded.
(2) For purposes of this Section 2.5, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in any periodic or current report of the corporation filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(3) Any references in this Section 2.5 to the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to paragraph (A)(2) or (B) of this Section 2.5. Nothing in these bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of a stockholder to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
(4) All notices required to be given by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.5 must be in writing and delivered to the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation in person or by first class United States mail postage prepaid or by reputable overnight delivery service within the time limits specified in this Section 2.5. Any other form of communication, including without limitation facsimile transmission and email, shall not satisfy the notice requirements of this Section 2.5 applicable to stockholders.
. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given (including without limitation by a form of electronic transmission in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware) shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6

Except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority of such quorum shall be deemed the act of the stockholders.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 12, 2008, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or "the Company") announced its financial results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended October 26, 2008. A copy of Applied's press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference in such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On November 12, 2008, Applied announced that in light of deteriorating economic conditions and market uncertainties, it intends to implement a restructuring program designed to streamline the organization and reduce operating costs. Applied plans to begin implementing the program in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and to complete the program by the end of fiscal 2009. When completed, the program is expected to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million. As part of the program, Applied expects to eliminate 1,800 positions, or approximately 12% of its global workforce, through a combination of attrition, voluntary separation and other workforce reduction actions. Changes to the Company's workforce will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as applicable. The Company expects that all employee-related charges under the program will result in cash expenditures and that these charges will be recorded in fiscal 2009.
Due to the variability of costs associated with voluntary separation programs, Applied is unable at this time to make a good faith determination of cost estimates, or ranges of cost estimates, associated with the program as set forth in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Item 2.05 of Form 8-K. In accordance with paragraph (d) of Item 2.05, Applied will timely file an amendment to this report after its determination of such estimates or ranges of estimates.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the expected nature, timing, reductions, objectives, annualized cost savings, and charges of the restructuring program. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to: uncertain global and economic market conditions; Applied's ability to implement the program as planned; retention of key employees; changes in Applied's business requirements; the possibility that benefits of the program may not materialize as expected; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings and the press release furnished herewith. Applied undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

     "Fiscal 2008 was a pivotal year for Applied as we made significant progress in advancing our Silicon and Display businesses and expanding in the solar market. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate effective performance in a very challenging environment," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "We passed a major milestone as the first SunFab Thin Film Solar Line began volume production demonstrating Applied's commitment to deliver exciting new technology to the solar industry.
tm
     "As Applied moves into fiscal 2009, we will implement further cost-reduction actions due to declining market conditions, and we will invest in strategic priorities," concluded Splinter.
     Applied will implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, designed to streamline the organization and reduce operating costs. When completed the program is expected to drive annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million. As part of this program, the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 12% or 1,800 positions by the end of fiscal 2009 through a combination of attrition, voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements and in consultation with employee representatives, where applicable.
 
     Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2008 was $1.20 billion, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $1.90 billion, or $1.33 per diluted share, for fiscal 2007. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $264 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $472 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, and $228 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
     Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied changed its management reporting system for services, with all service results reported in the Applied Global Services segment. Fiscal 2007 segment information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. Results by reportable segment for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were:
     Results by reportable segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
 
     Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) certain items associated with acquisitions, including inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and amortization of purchased intangible assets, (iii) restructuring and asset impairments, (iv) certain costs associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and/or (v) the resolution of income tax audits and changes in tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2008 full year and fourth quarter results, along with its outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, on the earnings call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. A webcast of the earnings call will be available at .

(e) Term Sheet for Employment of Michael R. Splinter
On December 8, 2008, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved amendments to the term sheet for the employment of Michael R. Splinter, Applied's President and Chief Executive Officer (the "Term Sheet"). The Committee approved the amendments so that any bonuses paid to Mr. Splinter under Applied's Senior Executive Bonus Plan may continue to qualify as performance-based compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and any benefits paid under the Term Sheet will comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
The amendments provide that if Mr. Splinter's employment is terminated for any reason other than for cause, the cash severance payable to Mr. Splinter will be a lump sum payment of 275% of his then current base salary. Prior to the amendments, if Mr. Splinter's employment were terminated other than for cause, he would have received one year of his then current base salary and 100% of his target bonus for the year in which his termination occurs (which, for fiscal year 2008, was 175% of his base salary).
Under the amended Term Sheet, Mr. Splinter is no longer entitled to any severance payment on account of his target bonus. Additionally, in order to comply with Section 409A, the Term Sheet now requires that the payout of the severance payable to Mr. Splinter be delayed for a period of six months in the event such severance: (a) is determined to be deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and (b) otherwise is not exempt from such six-month delay under Section 409A.
 
(a)(1) On December 8, 2008, the Board approved an amendment (the "Amendment") to Applied's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), effective immediately. The full text of the Bylaws, as so amended, is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1.
(b) The Amendment amends and restates Section 8.1 of the Bylaws to provide that the Bylaws "may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by either (i) the board of directors or (ii) the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the stock issued and outstanding which is present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the meeting at which such action is taken."
In light of the ongoing financial crisis and weakening global economy, on December 8, 2008, the Board's Human Resources and Compensation Committee approved a ten percent reduction in the annual cash retainer payable to Applied's non-employee directors. Effective immediately, non-employee directors will receive an annual retainer of $58,500, reduced from an annual retainer of $65,000. This reduction in non-employee director compensation is consistent with the ongoing ten percent reduction in base salary for each of Applied's senior executive officers.

(y) as to any other business (excluding the nomination of a person for election or reelection as a director) that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made (as well as (i) such other information concerning such business and the stockholder proponent as would be required by the appropriate Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the proposal and (ii) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal); and
(z) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (ii)(A) the class or series and the number of shares of capital stock that are, directly or
 
indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and by any such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any short interest in any security of the corporation (for purposes of this Section 2.5 a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (D) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (E) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instrument held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (F) any performance-related fees (other than an asset based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instrument, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of such record date). For purposes of these bylaws, the terms "beneficial owner" and "beneficial ownership" shall include without limitation the meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 13d-3 (or any successor rule) under the Exchange Act.
The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information in addition to that required by paragraph (A)(2)(z) as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
(3) In the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the corporation's nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least eighty-five (85) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new seats on the board of directors created by such increase, if it is delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
 
No business other than that stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders shall be transacted at such special meeting. If the business stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders includes electing one or more directors to the board of directors, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at such special meeting may be made only (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the corporation's notice of meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who gives timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary; clause (2) of this sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations before a special meeting of stockholders. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the 75th day prior to such special meeting or, (b) if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than eighty five (85) days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth the information called for by clauses (x) and (z) of paragraph (A)(2) above.
 
(1) The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 and, if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.5, to declare that such non-compliant proposal or nomination be disregarded.
(2) For purposes of this Section 2.5, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in any periodic or current report of the corporation filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(3) Any references in this Section 2.5 to the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to paragraph (A)(2) or (B) of this Section 2.5.

. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given (including without limitation by a form of electronic transmission in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware) shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 2, 2009  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced preliminary results for its first fiscal quarter ended January 25, 2009.
The company expects a net loss in the range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share for the first fiscal quarter, which includes the following charges that decreased earnings per share by $0.09: 1] a restructuring charge of approximately $133 million (or $0.06 per share) associated with a cost reduction program announced on November 12, 2008; 2] a provision of $48 million (or $0.02 per share) for doubtful accounts receivable related to certain customers' deteriorating financial condition in the challenging economic and industry environment; and 3] additional inventory charges of $20 million (or $0.01 per share) due to a decline in demand for semiconductor and display products. On November 12, 2008, the company provided a target of earnings per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter in the range of $0.00 to $0.04. This target did not include the above charges, which could not be estimated or were not known at that time.
Net Sales for the first fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately $1.33 billion, down 35 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and at the low end of the previously provided target range of down 25 to 35 percent.
The company intends to continue implementing cost reduction programs, including shutdowns and additional restructuring activities, as appropriate for the unprecedented business conditions.
On February 10, 2009, Applied Materials will announce its first fiscal quarter results and hold its regularly scheduled conference call beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available to all interested parties on Applied Materials' Web site at http://www.appliedmaterials.com under the "Investors" section.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including those relating to expected results for the first fiscal quarter and cost reduction programs. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to: possible adjustments to financial results as Applied completes its regular closing process for the first fiscal quarter; uncertain global economic and industry conditions; Applied's ability to maintain effective cost controls and timely align its cost structure with business conditions; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings, including its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Explanatory Note
On November 12, 2008, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Initial Filing") that included, in Item 2.05 thereof, disclosure regarding the Company's implementation of a restructuring program. Applied is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend Item 2.05 of the Initial Filing to provide additional information regarding the restructuring program, including the cost estimates associated with this program, which could not be estimated at the time of the Initial Filing. Except as stated herein, no other changes are being made to the Initial Filing.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On November 12, 2008, Applied reported its intent to implement a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary separation and other workforce reduction actions. Due to the variability of costs associated with voluntary separation programs, Applied was unable at the time of the Initial Filing to make a good faith determination of the cost estimates, or ranges of cost estimates, associated with the restructuring program.
Applied currently expects to incur total charges associated with the restructuring program of approximately $133 million, consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits, which amount represents substantially all of the expected costs for this program. These charges will be recorded in the Company's first fiscal quarter ended January 25, 2009 and will result in cash expenditures of approximately $133 million through October 2009.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the expected charges and cash expenditures under the restructuring program. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to: uncertain global economic and industry conditions; Applied's ability to implement the program as planned; retention of key employees; changes in Applied's business requirements; and other risks described in Applied's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. Applied undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 10, 2009  Applied Materials, Inc. today reported that for its first fiscal quarter ended January 25, 2009, net sales were $1.33 billion, gross margin was 29.4 percent, GAAP net loss was $133 million, GAAP net loss per share was $0.10, and new orders were $903 million. These results included a restructuring charge of $133 million associated with a global cost reduction program announced on November 12, 2008.
     "We acted early and decisively to reduce costs in line with economic conditions that have resulted in an unprecedented decline in demand," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "With our leading technology and strong balance sheet, Applied is positioned to weather this recession and invest in new products and services."
     The following table shows comparisons to the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008.
     Regional distribution of new orders was: Europe 39 percent, North America 26 percent, Japan 17 percent, Southeast Asia and China 9 percent, Korea 7 percent, and Taiwan 2 percent. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $4.05 billion, down from $4.85 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
     Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $3 million, or $0.00 per share. The following table shows comparisons of non-GAAP results to the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
 
Applied Materials, Inc. Page 2 of 7
     Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to one or more of the following: (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) gain on sale of facility, (iii) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles and inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, (iv) restructuring and asset impairments, (v) certain costs associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and/or (vi) the resolution of income tax audits and changes in tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) or earnings (loss) per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In a Form 8-K filed on March 4, 2008, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") previously announced that it had entered into sales agreements (the "original agreements") providing for Applied to supply its SunFab thin film tandem junction solar production equipment and related services to a privately-held company ("Buyer") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$1.9 billion.
In light of the subsequent deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions, the parties recently entered into an amendment of the original agreements (the "amended agreement") that, among other things and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, reduces the production capacity to be supplied by Applied and reduces the aggregate purchase price to approximately US$250 million. Upon Buyer's performance of specified payment and security obligations under the amended agreement and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, the rights and obligations of each of Applied and Buyer under the original agreements with respect to the purchase and sale of the remaining solar production equipment and related services shall terminate, except for certain rights and obligations specified in the amended agreement.
Applied has not recognized any orders in connection with the original agreements or the amended agreement.
The parties will continue to explore additional business opportunities, the outcome of which depends on financing availability, economic and market conditions, and other factors.

"Since 2006, Applied has successfully extended our nanomanufacturing leadership from semiconductor and display to the solar industry, and during that time we have seen changes in customer and geographic concentration in all of these markets," Splinter added. "We are adapting our operating structure to align with these changes and enhance the value we provide to our customers and stockholders."

- Applied Materials - VP IR
Thank you, Sarah. And good afternoon, everyone and thank you for participating in today's call. Our earnings release was issued at 1:05 Pacific Time over Business Wire. You can also find a copy of the release and a related slide presentation on our investor relations Website on www.appliedmaterials.com. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
Today, we'll discuss the results for our fourth quarter and our 2009 fiscal year that ended on October 25. We will also talk about our strategic actions and our business outlook for the current quarter and fiscal year. We have a lot of information to share with you today and we'll do our best to deliver it quickly and make time for your questions. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Mike. And welcome to today's call. Applied Materials returned to profitability in Q4, achieving sales and earnings growth that exceeded our expectations. We saw progress across the Company, with sequential growth in orders, sales and operating profit in every segment. Notably, our semiconductor business is in the early phase of a recovery, with gross margins exceeding 50% in the quarter, demonstrating the strength of the business model. SSG is positioned to drive further profits as WFE expands in 2010. Our operations team responded well to the ramp in demand, enabling the Company to increase sales by 35% and generate operating cash flow of $241 million.
Reviewing 09 results, I'm pleased to say we made excellent progress on our strategic objectives for the year. Last November, at the onset of the global financial crisis, we moved rapidly to lower our cost structure with a program that created $460 million in annualized savings. We aggressively managed working capital, retaining the financial strength to invest for growth. We grew share in our semiconductor equipment business, led by gains in inspection, epi and PVD. We grew our solar revenue by 40% year-over-year and took significant steps towards profitability. We made substantial investments in our future, with more than $900 million in R&D that resulted in new products across each of our markets. And Applied was recognized as the number one equipment supplier across semiconductors, LCD displays and now solar PV. Each of our segments represents a substantial growth opportunity for Applied and our businesses in multiple industries differentiate us from our competitors, giving us unique opportunities for growth and scale.
I want to thank the entire Applied team for their extraordinary contributions during a very challenging, yet productive year. They focused on satisfying our customers' needs and on meeting the ambitious goals we set.
Over the past two years, we've witnessed fundamental changes in the industries we serve. Including customer consolidation and moderating long-term growth rates in WFE. We are focusing this year's strategic plan on addressing the implications of these changes to maximize our growth opportunities and improve our competitiveness and efficiency. Specifically, we are embedding our worldwide sales force within the business units, bringing us closer to our customers and making us more efficient. We are streamlining and consolidating our manufacturing and supply chain operations under one leader to drive best known methods, scalability and cost improvements throughout our businesses. We're
3
 
increasing our manufacturing and supply chain presence in Asia, to be closer to more of our customers, reduce cycle times and increase the use of a more efficient supply base.
We're also consolidating our solar business under one executive and aligning our activities with the evolving global market. We're investing in common business processes and improved transaction processing capabilities that will make us leaner and faster. And we're improving our portfolio allocation process, while focusing our R&D investments on our opportunities to grow market share. As recently announced, I've also taken actions to align my executive team with the opportunities and challenges ahead.
I'll now comment on each of our businesses. In SSG, we expect to grow revenue by at least 40% year-over-year. We estimate WFE to reach $18 billion to $20 billion in calendar 2010, up from $12 billion to $13 billion in 09. Our customers have reported higher factory utilization across the board. DRAM and NAND prices have strengthened, encouraging more of our memory customers to invest in the next generation of technology. And our foundry customers are investing in capacity additions, as well as technology transitions. We gained share in 09 with strength in a number of areas. PVD and Epi benefited from application wins in advanced transistors and interconnect.
We believe we doubled our reticle inspection share in the year. And we recently won a new position at a major NAND manufacture for in-fab applications. Our reticle inspection solution is now in production at four large customers, with repeat business at three. Our brightfield inspection has won positions in advanced memory applications, while expanding into immersion lithography at most foundries. And we held share in etch. We expect another year of share gains in calendar 2010, driven by product strength in our leadership areas and growth opportunities in inspection and etch where the outlook for stronger memory spending is a significant positive for Applied.
Looking at technology trends, we're focused on the DRAM conversion to copper, NAND transitioning to 3X using double patterning, advanced transistors in logic and foundry, and emerging capabilities like wafer-level packaging and 3D memory cells. We're also focused on extending our strong market positions in PVD, CVD and CMP to the 22-nanometer node. In display, we've seen strong demand for TV's and LCD monitors over the past several quarters, particularly in China. Leading customers have returned to profitability and factory utilization remains high. These trends are leading customers to add capacity. And we expect equipment spending in the industry to be up more than 40% in calendar 2010, with the bulk of the purchases concentrated at Gen 8.5.
We are now seeing proposals by major customers to build advanced fabs in China. This strategic shift reflects the growing importance of China's domestic market, which saw an 80% year-over-year rise in LCD TV demand. In 2010, we expect to grow our Pivot PVD position, expanding to more customers and gaining an estimated 10 points of share. During the quarter, we launched copper capability on the Pivot system and strategic investment in Gen 10 is moving forward with multiple systems in production.
In EES, while the solar market weakened substantially during the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue grew more than 40%, driven by thin film signoffs and strength in crystal and silicon cell manufacturing. During the fourth quarter, the solar PV marketplace showed signs of improvement, as module price declines slowed and financing opportunities gradually improved. Germany remains a bright spot, particularly in the crystalline silicon rooftop market. China and Taiwan are growing markets for our crystalline silicon equipment, with capacity growth rates significantly above those of other geographies. In crystalline silicon, our customers want to increase automation and improve conversion efficiencies. While the crystalline silicon equipment outlook for 2010 is still uncertain, there are some positive signs of capacity additions in cell equipment, primarily at Chinese customers.
The drive toward ever lower costs moves the industry to require thinner wafers and thin wafer handling, which provide growth opportunities for our MaxEdge Wire Saw and Baccini metallization systems. Our plan is to address these needs and grow our served market share opportunity in cell equipment from 50% of the CapEx spend, to 80% over the next three years. Steps in this direction include our double printing capability on the Baccini platform and our acquisition of Advent Solar last week. Our crystalline silicon installed base now exceeds 2,500 systems, creating a significant opportunity for service and after-market upgrades.
Our progress in thin film this year culminated in the seventh customer signoff of a SunFab production line at ENN in China. This was our second tandem junction line. For existing and future SunFab customers, we have driven economies to scale and with leading suppliers to reduce the cost of materials by 22%. And this improved process flow has received IEC certification. With steady gains in panel efficiency and factory productivity across the SunFab network, we are on track to our 2010 goal of 10% efficiency and $1 per watt cost. In the near term, market conditions are challenging for many of our thin film customers, as discounted crystalline silicon panels are impacting pricing and demand for thin film technology.
In calendar 2010, we expect worldwide solar PV installations to be up over 40%,with solar representing one of Applied's key growth opportunities over the next several years. We recently opened a solar R&D center in Xi'an, China, which demonstrates our substantial
4
 
commitment to thin film and crystalline silicon technology and is advantageously located in China, the solar market's fastest growing geography. We've become number one in solar PV equipment. And in less than three years, we've built $1 billion equipment business that has the scale and global reach of no other competitor. Now, we are on track for EES to deliver break-even or better operating results during this fiscal year.
In services, our orders and revenue increased, with 300-millimeter starts returning to pre-recession levels. While 200-millimeter wafer starts are down roughly 25% from last year. We expect virtually all of our future service growth to come from 300-millimeter starts expansion. Our spares run rate is up significantly from the trough in Q2, though it is not yet approaching the previous peak. Operating margins are improving and we are focused on driving further efficiencies in services delivery as part of our 2010 strategic initiatives. In semiconductor services, the number of tools under contract grew 7% year-over-year, with notably high growth in Asia. A key to growth in AGS is expanding our service and spares position in Asia, where over 80% of new wafer starts will be.
In summary, Applied's goal is to lead the industry and gain share in our core semiconductor markets, drive growth in display and services and greatly expand our opportunity in energy solutions. We will also take advantage of our global footprint and scale to deliver outstanding profitability. After a challenging 2009, we expect sales growth of at least 30% in fiscal 2010 and a significant benefits from structuring the Company for future success. I will now hand the call over to George for more details on our results and targets. George.
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Thank you, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. Applied completed a challenging fiscal year with a solid fourth quarter, including revenue and earnings well above our targets. We enter our new fiscal year with momentum in our higher margin businesses, a strong operating model and improved market share.
First, let me summarize our full year performance in a very difficult 2009. We had orders of $4.1 billion, which were down 55% from 2008, and net sales of $5 billion, which were down 38%. We reported a GAAP net loss of $305 million or $0.23 per share. We were profitable for the year on a non-GAAP basis, earning $37 million or $0.03 per share. We took early action on cost reductions and surpassed our objective of $400 million of structural cost savings by 15%. In addition, we had $340 million in annualized savings from temporary cost measures related to employee salary and variable compensation. Approximately 70% of those temporary savings were in OpEx, with the remainder in cost of goods.
We began these temporary cost measures in the latter half of 2008 and approximately 2/3 of those savings were already in effect by the end of Q4 08.
Beginning in fiscal Q1 2010, we have eliminated shutdowns, other than our normal holiday shutdown, and will resume accruing for variable compensation. This will result in an increase in Q1 OpEx versus Q4, as the anticipated savings from our new actions will not fully offset these added costs until later in the program. We generated $333 million of operating cash flow in 2009 and ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion.
Looking at our businesses in 2009, SSG and AGS revenue bottomed in our second fiscal quarter and both segments returned to operating profitability in the second half of the year. Revenue in our display business declined almost 50% from fiscal 2008 but it's flexible business model limited operating losses to one quarter. Despite the severe business conditions, SSG, AGS and display each delivered positive operating margin overall in fiscal 2009. In EES, we grew revenue by 41% year-over-year, led by customer acceptance of six SunFab lines. We invested to extend our crystalline silicon and thin film solar technologies and to expand our portfolio of new products. In EES, we expect a move from a loss position of $242 million in 2009, to break even or better on an operating basis in 2010.
Looking at our Q4 results. orders were 37% higher sequentially, led by EES and display. Net sales increased 35%, driven by foundry customers in SSG and leading edge capacity expansion in display. The added revenue came from strong margin flow-through, contributing to earnings of $138 million or $0.10 per share. Our lower effective tax rate for the quarter of 21% contributed approximately $0.01 per share compared to Q3. Gross margin improved 8 points to 37%, which is close to the 39% level achieved in Q4 of last year, despite revenue being 25% lower. Our 8 point sequential margin expansion was primarily driven by revenue growth in our higher margin businesses.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments of $3.3 billion were up 4% from Q3. Cash from operations was $241 million or 16% of revenue. Our working capital results were strong, with days sales outstanding of 62 days and a net inventory reduction of $121 million compared to Q3 levels, despite a substantial increase in net sales. Our ending backlog was $2.7 billion, down 7% from the previous quarter end. 41% of the backlog is now related to our EES business, with display and SSG each at 20% and AGS at 19%.
5
 
The low percentage of SSG backlog reflects our shorter cycle times and our ability to respond to our semiconductor customers' short lead time on orders. In fact, our SSG turns business in Q4 was 61% of revenue in that segment. Backlog adjustments totaled $171 million and reflected the volatility of some of our customers' investment plans. Backlog adjustments included $168 million in cancellations and $3 million of currency and other adjustments.
Next, I'll summarize segment results for the quarter. Our silicon systems business performed very well. Orders increased 16% over Q3 at $629 million. Foundry customers were 37% of the order book and have led in that category for three consecutive quarters. SSG revenue increased 32%, again led by foundry, along with strong demand from logic and memory customers. SSG operating profits were $158 million, up substantially from Q3 and represented an impressive 24% of sales.
In AGS, orders increased 13% to $335 million and revenue increased 14%, relative to Q3, to $390 million. Operating profit was $64 million or 17% of sales, reflecting an accelerating recovery in spares sales. Display orders increased 58% to $151 million, as robust end market demand fueled Gen 8.5 capacity investments. Revenue grew to $200 million as we signed off multiple leading edge systems. Display operating margins benefited from the revenue improvement, reaching $43 million or 21% of revenue.
In EES, orders were $357 million, up significantly from Q3, as a SunFab project in China entered our 12 month booking window. EES revenue of $280 million was up 25%, driven by the signoff of a tandem junction SunFab line, which offset a slight decline in crystalline silicon sales. EES posted an operating loss of $30 million, an improvement of more than 40% from Q3. Over half of the EES operating loss is attributable to M&A charges and nonsolar R&D. EES's quarterly results will continue to be volatile based on the timing of factory signoffs.
Next, I'll comment on our financial expectations for the strategic actions Mike announced earlier. Total savings from these actions are expected to be $450 million over the next 18 months, of which we expect approximately $250 million to be from OpEx. These actions will also include workforce reductions of approximately 10% to 12% or 1,300 to 1,500 employees over the same period. The pre-tax cost for employee severance is expected to be between $100 million and $125 million and we are forecasting a $0.06 to $0.07 per share charge in the first quarter.
Next, I'll talk about some of the key assumptions behind our expectation for net sales to be up greater than 30% in fiscal 2010. Our forecast assumes that wafer fab equipment CapEx will be $18 billion to $20 billion for calendar year 2010. Display capital spending for equipment will be up at least 40% for the year. EES net sales are expected to be plus or minus 10% from 2009 levels. Solar growth is expected to be impacted by absorption of significant capacity additions in crystalline silicon over the past two years. Upside to this view would be driven by better than expected capacity additions in crystalline silicon and from new product penetrations. Finally, we expect that services will continue to recover, although at a somewhat lower rate than the underlying equipment businesses.
Now, before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I want to review some housekeeping items that will take effect in our Q1. First, marketing and sales expenses that were previously reported in corporate will now be reported in the business segments. This is consistent with embedding our sales teams in our businesses. Second, we are moving the cost of certain segment related bonus accruals out of corporate and into the segments for better visibility. Historically, we accrued target variable compensation in the segments and then took any adjustments in corporate. The third and final change is that we will no longer include stock option expenses in our reconciliation for non-GAAP results. Our GAAP results already reflect these costs, so there is no net change. None of these changes will have a financial impact on the Company's financial results.
Next, I'll review our outlook for fiscal Q1. We see further recovery in our first quarter, particularly in semiconductor capital equipment. We expect SSG revenue to be up by more than 20% due to strong investment in wafer fab equipment by foundry and memory customers. AGS is expected to grow modestly quarter over quarter. Display is still in a ramp mode, although we expect Q1 net sales to be down relative to a very strong Q4. This is a timing issue, as we had a major shipment pull into Q4 09. We expect EES revenue to be up by more than 20% due to both factory and bonus signoff opportunities.
For Q1, we expect net sales, overall, to be up 10% to 25%. We expect earnings to improve to somewhere in the range of $0.10 and $0.14 per share, before taking into account the impact of restructuring charges. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher revenue in SSG, AGS and EES, partially offset by the restoration of base salaries, the phasing in of variable compensation, a 14th week of costs in the quarter and a decline in display revenue relative to Q4. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, with a $0.01 negative impact relative to last quarter. The impact of the restructuring charge will be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07 per share, which brings our GAAP EPS target for Q1 to between $0.04 and $0.08 per share. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
 
Stephen Chin
- UBS - Analyst
Great, thank you. Hi, Mike and George. A question on the linearity for the fiscal 2010 sales. It looks like fiscal 2010 sales are pretty heavily front-end loaded here, with some conservatism built into the second half of the year. Is that the right way to think of it? And as a follow-on, can you share any color on normalized operating margin targets after this restructuring? Thanks.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
I'll try to answer your question on linearity, Stephen, and let George answer the question on targets. On linearity, I think it's very hard for us to tell what's going to happen in the second half of the year at this point. I think we're pleased to see what we perceive as strength in the first half of the year and have it be pretty broad-based, and particularly with upticks from foundries and DRAM makers. Now how strong it will be in the second half, I really think that depends on how the market goes in the first half and how strong we think the economy is as we head into selling season next year.
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Stephen, on the margins, I would say that we still see 2010 as a period of recovery. We, obviously, are very pleased with the structural changes we've made in our cost structure over the past two years. We think that's going to serve our business model well. And when we get back into a normalized environment, we certainly expect to be back at the 20%, 25% plus type margins for the Company overall.
 
Michael Sullivan
- Applied Materials - VP IR
Stephen, thanks for your questions.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs and Company.
 
Jim Covello
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
Great, good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. If I could focus first on silicon systems group. And of the top 10 customers in SSG, with the guidance that you gave for the first quarter, how would you characterize the top 10 customers? Are they - are most of them active now? Are half of them active, are only a few of them active? Again, kind of thinking about the top 10.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Most of them are active now to some degree. I would say, the top five are certainly very active and account for a big part, more than - certainly substantially more than 50% of the revenue in SSG.
 
Jim Covello
- Goldman Sachs - Analyst
And do you think that they can continue to grow or would you expect them to stay at that higher level and further growth be dependent upon the rest of the top 10 and beyond the top 10 coming in?
7
 
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Well, I think really the issue is; When do the memory guys get into a capacity expansion? Today, it's primarily technology transition and that's about all we're seeing out of the memory guys. Just to kind of give you an idea, we estimate something close to 1 million memory wafers are going to move from one node to the next. That combines DRAM and NAND. While we'll have maybe 10% of that number in capacity expansions. So, we've got to see bit growth higher than it is, in both DRAM and NAND, to really drive some substantial additional capacity expansion.
 
Michael Sullivan
- Applied Materials - VP IR
Thank you, Jim.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse.
 
Satya Kumar
- Credit Suisse - Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. George, how should we think about the pace of the cost reduction in fiscal 2010 and why did you not guide EPS also for fiscal 2010?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Well I think we're very confident that earnings will be up strongly, in line with the growth in revenue. So, we certainly feel good about the earnings outlook for 2010. We think there is a lot of mix issues that still have to be sorted out over time. We'll certainly update our views and help people sort that through. But in general, I think people can see that over the past year and really two years, we've taken substantial structural costs out. So, as you model the growth rates, and we're saying significant growth rates in display and SSG over that time period, there will be a lot of earnings leverage to the upside in 2010.
 
Satya Kumar
- Credit Suisse - Analyst
And maybe I'll follow-up later with you guys. And on EES, the last time you provided guidance for break-even or better in solar, you had not yet announced the restructuring. Now that you have. and also the run rate in EES is clearly higher than your $1 billion guidance for fiscal 2010, why not a better profitability target in the EES?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
We think that this is the right forecast for EES right now. As we said, there's still some uncertainty in the end markets because of what we're seeing in the crystalline silicon area. So, we think break even or better operating is still the right forecast.
 
Michael Sullivan
- Applied Materials - VP IR
Thanks, Satya.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
8
 
 
C.J. Muse
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is just to clarify, in terms of EES break even or better in fiscal 10, George, you're talking about operating levels. So, if we want to think about it on a GAAP basis, excluding stock comp and the amortization on the M&A side, what kind of run rate could we see?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Yes, good question. When we say operating basis, remember, going forward, that we're not going to include stock option expensing. So, you don't have to adjust for that. Really, we're talking about approximately $50 million of M&A related charges that we expect to see in 2010 that we would take out.
 
C.J. Muse
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
Great. And then, just if I could clarify also, on the EPS guide of $0.10 to $0.14, does that include stock-based comp?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Yes, that's - it includes everything except for the restructuring charges.
 
C.J. Muse
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
Okay. Perfect. And then, the meaty question. On the restructuring side, how should we think about the base level? You've talked about OpEx lower over 18 months by about $62 plus million, COGS by $50 million. What's the kind of baseline rate we should think of as a starting point and then see the reductions thereafter?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
I think ongoing OpEx, coming out of FY 09, was about $1.6 billion and you had roughly $50 million or $60 million of what we would call temporary OpEx in there. So, if you adjust for that, that's a reasonable starting point. Again, we took out, in the plan last year where we took out about $310 million of what I would call structural OpEx costs. And so, roughly $80 million a quarter came out of our run rate.
 
Michael Sullivan
- Applied Materials - VP IR
Thanks, C.J.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris [Lansic] with JPMorgan.
 
Chris Lansic
- JPMorgan - Analyst
Thanks, guys. I wanted to get an idea how of long it's going to take for you to start capitalizing on the purchase of Advent Solar?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Sure. I think it will really be 2011 before we see real meaningful sales from that technology. We need to finish up the development of the capability and then get it into the marketplace. So, I think before we see meaningful, I'll put 2011.
9
 
 
Chris Lansic
- JPMorgan - Analyst
And then, kind of again on solar, I think, Mike, you indicated you thought volume growth or installed capacity for solar would be up more than 40% in the next year. I wanted to understand your view of the German subsidy reduction risk when you put that number out there?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Yes, I think this risk has been overblown. I believe that when you look at what will happen in Germany next year, I think it will be flat to up. And then, increases in Italy and China and the US will drive the rest of the upside.
 
Chris Lansic
- JPMorgan - Analyst
All right, thank you.
 
Michael Sullivan
- Applied Materials - VP IR
Thank you, Chris.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned that the foundries have been a big contributor to the silicon strength in the last three quarters. And 37% foundry orders is probably the highest we have seen for Applied in a long time. Foundries spending at $1 billion to $1.2 billion at CapEx. So, my question is, if foundry strength starts to come down in the first half and memory capacity orders are not back, could we see a scenario where we can see overall orders start to come down in the first half?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Our view of what's going to happen with the foundry spending and kind of our  maybe a little bit more color on the overall capital spending, we think foundries for the year, we've made a projection of $18 billion to $20 billion, we think foundries are going to be between 25% and 35% of that number. And exactly how it's going to be loaded, I really cannot quite say yet. But when we look at the number of customers that are going to reach the $1 billion range, in 2009, I think there were three customers that reached $1 billion in CapEx. We think there will be at least eight in 2010. And we do think, as I said, if there is more bit growth, there can be substantial investment in capacity. But we have to see that bit growth first.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
 
Timothy Arcuri
- Citigroup - Analyst
Hi, guys. A couple of things. First of all, George, the $450 million in savings, does that cannibalize any of your current revenue or is that just straight savings?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
No, we're taking cost savings that we think will not interfere with our ability to drive revenue growth. So, these are really structural changes that will take place over time, as we go through many of the elements that Mike talked about, which includes moving sales into the businesses. Consolidating our field resources as our customer base has changed. Global manufacturing and supply chain consolidation. And movement to more manufacturing and supply activity in Asia, which has a lot of cycle time and cost benefits. So, all of the things that we talked about, really we think are a combination of better competitive positioning and also more efficient, not from reducing or selling off a product that is generating revenue.
 
Timothy Arcuri
- Citigroup - Analyst
Okay. Yes, I was wondering whether just cutting all of those heads would impact your ability to actually generate revenue. But as a follow-up, the last two quarters you've worked off backlog a bit. You've booked a bit less than you've revenued. And I'm wondering, if I take sort of the midpoint of the revenue guidance, roughly $1.8 billion, do you think the same thing is going to happen in fiscal Q1, ie. you're going to book less than you revenue or will you book more?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Not guiding to. We do expect orders to be up but we're not going to guide orders. But that is one of the best ways of backing into it that I've seen. So, it's a good question.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Hi, Tim, on the overall restructuring, I'd just say that we really try to go through every aspect of the way we do business. And ask ourselves how we're doing it? How we could do it more efficiently? Are we doing it in the right place? If we're not, how do we get to the right place for doing that? And that's really what the number reflects and what both the headcount and the savings number reflect.

Krish Sankar
- BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two questions, actually a question and a follow-up. The first one, lead times in the SSG business, how are they right now in 4Q and 1Q? And any visibility beyond the Jan quarter? And my follow-up question is, once the cost reductions are done, how do we think of the incremental margin for the Company and if possible, segment by segment? Thank you.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Well, I think lead times have shrunk quite a bit. We're putting a bit of stress on our supply chain right now. Our suppliers are responding. They're working very closely with us. But as George said, 61% of our revenue in Q4 was orders within the quarter. So, you kind of get an idea, we're moving products to customers very, very quickly. And George, do you want to comment on the incremental flow-through of profits?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Sure. I think you saw a very high flow-through this quarter. It gives you an idea of how we're already impacting our performance from the actions that we've taken to date. We certainly see an additional $450 million will have a positive impact. These actions are broad-based, they cut across the Company. So, it will positively impact every unit's margins. And at the annual analysts meeting, we'll go into more details about how you can see that over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
 
Steve O'Rourke
- Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. Could you say if the headcount reduction is net of new headcount that you'll be adding in Asia? And the second question, you mentioned that the SunFab lines, I think, came within the bookings, came within the 12-month time horizon. Are those rebookings? And how do you  do you feel confident that they may push out or not push out further?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Okay. On the headcount, yes those are net numbers. And then, in terms of the 12 month booking window, the way we book SunFab lines is we may sign a contract but because the lead times are longer than our 12 month booking window, we actually wait until we get to within 12 months of what we believe will be factory signoffs, which is the revenue event. And that's what happened now with this. So, there's no rebooking at all. We've just now are within 12 months of what we believe will be the revenue event.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter [Rice] with Global Crown.

Peter Rice
- Global Crown - Analyst
Great. Thank you for taking my question. My first question - congratulations, also, on great execution. Mike, I was hoping you could comment, across the board, it seems semi equipment companies are taking a more defensive posture, despite kind of going into a cyclical recovery, cutting heads, cutting costs. What's different in this upturn that's allowing the customers to support this? And as the follow-up, I was hoping you could comment, in the second half of the year, the recovery has largely been driven by technology spending. And I was hoping you could share your outlook of when the next phase of new fabs will be built out and what customer segments will be driving this initial recovery?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Well, Peter, I think the view of the future is different than in other recoveries. This particular recovery and I would say we certainly haven't recovered yet, so it is one that the environment is quite different. We still have a very fragile global economy. We have a customer base that's consolidated substantially and I think will continue to consolidate some as we go through time. So, we have to ensure that our cost structure and our ability to invest for the future is really intact. And that's a big part of what we're doing. And we also have to align the financials and pro forma for any of our groups to be consistent with the way we see the market.
So, I think that's pretty much the  it gets down to really a focus, if we look at AGS and SSG. In AGS, 25% of the 200-millimeter wafers are gone. They're not coming back. And so we have to ensure that AGS is set up to be profitable and effective at growing share but also be realistic about the market they're serving. Same in SSG. So, I think when the new fabs get moving again, I really think that depends  first of all, I don't know that we'll see new buildings before late in 2010. But there's plenty of space to fill up for the foreseeable feature in both memory and in foundries, I believe. So, I think 2010 is going to be a year of filling up existing fabs. But also, I think we're looking for those inflection points, primarily in memory, that are going to key them to say, "Okay, we have confidence to build capacity."
What we think those are is DRAM bit growth greater than 50%. And we're hoping, and want to watch this very carefully, that investments from industry and emergence of Windows 7 and growth in cell phones really does drive that bit growth in DRAM's. In NAND flash, we have to see bit growth above 100% and maybe even substantially above 100%. And again, that will be smartphones and MP3 players and the like that drive the flash bit capacity. I don't think that  we'll see SSD's, also but it's not going to be a big mover this year. Maybe in 2011, it will be the next phase of this buildout.

Your next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus.
 
Patrick Ho
- Stifel Nicolaus & Company - Analyst
Thanks a lot. I know you didn't give any quantitative guidance to the orders but can you discuss which customer segment will drive orders or at least on the semi-cap side of things? In the January quarter, is it going to be memory that takes the lead or will you still see foundries comprising the largest percentage?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
We think foundries will continue to be strong but it's really - we think DRAM is going to be the big driver in Q1.
13
 
 
Patrick Ho
- Stifel Nicolaus & Company - Analyst
Okay, great. And the second question is, in terms of the cash generation now that you're starting to put together as you're making money again, what do you plan to do with it? Are you going to sit on the sidelines or are you going to reinitiate stock buyback like you did in the last up cycle?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
We still believe that share repurchase is the best way of returning excess cash flow. So, we will begin to share repurchase again as soon as we're comfortable that our  that things have stabilized in the economy. We get more than just one or two strong quarters of cash flow. And I think there's  our view of how much cash we would hold is probably a little bit higher than what we had going into the year 2009. Although, we feel we're in a very strong position right now. So, we want to see a little more continuity in the economic recovery but we're still a believer in share repurchase.

Weston Twigg
- Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the EES group a little bit. You talked about expanding your TAM, mentioned it as one of the key growth opportunities over the next several years. Yet, you guided revenue flat for 2010 with 2009, plus or minus 10%. So, I'm just wondering, when do you expect the growth to come and what would be the key catalyst to look for?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
I think we're quite excited about this space in particular. But during those comments, I was referring to crystalline silicon and we're coming out with a number of new products there that should expand our TAM. What we're concerned about right now is wafering and how fast wafering expansion is going to occur. And that's really what we look for, as wafering orders start to come in, we know that the cell orders aren't far behind because those wafers have to go to a manufacturing line someplace. So, that's our caution side. If we see that grow, I think we're going to do  we're going to have a very good year in crystalline silicon.
 
Weston Twigg
- Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst
Okay. And then, with the $50 million in M&A charges, is that for acquisitions you've already made or should we expect more, perhaps on the crystalline silicon side, in 2010?

And your next question comes from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer and Company.
 
Gary Hsueh
- Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst
Great. Within the context of the EES revenue guidance for next fiscal year, plus or minus 10%, just wondering what your assumptions are for project signoffs, particularly what's the total tally in terms of project signoffs in fiscal 09? And on average, what's the megawatt size of those signoffs? And what's embedded in your expectations in terms of the flat plus our minus 10% guidance for EES as a whole, next year, in terms of project signoffs, the number and the average megawatt size? I've got a follow-up as well.
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Well, I'll  we certainly have at least three or four more factories to be signed off in that forecast. We also expect a certain number of bonuses to potentially be paid during that time period. I'm not going to go into the details on the megawatts. But we have  again, I would say some of the  well, certainly, the largest factory will be coming in the latter part of the year that we have.
 
Gary Hsueh
- Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst
Okay. Great and my follow-up question is just about some of the reorganization that's been happening. I jumped on the call late but I wanted to understand whether or not there's any structural reorganization, specific to etch and inspection, that really might help you kind of re-energize the effort in terms of regrowing the market share, particularly in etch? And to a lesser extent, in inspection since you've made some headway there already?

Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FBR.
 
Mehdi Hosseini
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first question has to do with EES. Have you done any studies to figure out, the kind of estimated megawatt of installations that your SunFab customers could be manufacturing for, especially over the next, say, 12 months? And then, George, in regard to the January quarter, given such a wide delta in the guidance range, help me understand, what would it take to hit the low end versus the high end of the revenue guidance range?
15
 
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Hi, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the megawatt installations, since this is output from customers' factories, it's very hard for me to comment. But obviously, the top side is their rated capacity. And other than that, I can't say a whole lot. There's been announcements about the rated capacity of each of those factories.
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
I think the range reflects the range that we gave on revenue. And I think if you think about the low end, so it would be, if for some reason revenue grew at the low end. Remember, we have about $0.02 to $0.03 of cost in OpEx in Q1 that we didn't have in Q4. And the tax rate impacts us about $0.01, as well. So, the low end of that range is probably not as a low a performance, straight up comparison-wise as you might consider.

Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
 
Edwin Mok
- Needham & Company - Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. The first question was backlog, you had $116 million of cancellation. Can you tell us where that cancellation comes from, in terms of which group and how do we look at that going forward? Is that something that we should expect ongoing? And then, just a follow-up question regarding your strategic initiative. I was just wondering the guidance of $450 million savings, does that include the potential savings you can get from transitioning the manufacturing to Singapore? And if not, then, how much would that incrementally be on top of that $450 million?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
Yes, I'll take your second question first. The $450 million does include benefits associated with that activity over the next 18 months. And then, in terms of the backlog adjustments, what we're seeing is, I would say, about $90 million of the cancellations were in our SSG group. And really just reflect the fact that the customers' plans have been changing fairly substantially. And as we talked about, their order patterns are shortening up substantially. So, we're now down to about 20% of our backlog is SSG. So, not a lot of volatility going forward. The rest of it is between AGS and EES. With EES mostly centered around crystalline silicon customers around the world. All right.

Mahesh Sanganeria
- RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
Thank you. Just another question on OpEx. If you look at the temporary savings you had, $315 million, 70% came from OpEx. So, that pretty much is offset by the $250 million in savings you're going to get from the restructuring. So, I'm just looking at the profile, it looks like the temporary savings comes back faster and the restructuring will come slower. So, OpEx will increase. And then towards the end of the year, the impact comes back to starting point. Is that the right way to think it?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
I think that's a fair way to look at it. And we'll give you an update every quarter on our progress, which should help you tune your model over time.
 
Mahesh Sanganeria
- RBC Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. Just one quick one. So your SG&A went down significantly from $168 million to $155 million. And you think that that was a one-time thing and it goes back to $168 million or a higher level?
 
George Davis
- Applied Materials - CFO
SG&A, I think you'll see some movements  again, part of what you'll see with part of the restructuring, SG&A will improve over time as part of the actions that we're taking. So, I think the way to think about it is as revenue increases, you'll see more and more flow-through because the temporary costs will come back at a slower rate after we see further recovery.

Jaridesh Ayer

Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. One, is how should we think about this Advent Solar acquisition in terms of your incremental revenue opportunities going into say 2011? Because it looks like it's a very disruptive technology. How should we think about that? And the second question as a follow-up is that we've been hearing that logic and foundry customers are pursuing this double patterning screen of litho-etch-litho-etch. How does the dynamics change because you've been pushing the self-aligned double patterning? You can help us understand this dynamic please? Thanks.
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
Well, on Advent, first of all, it's way too early to make a forecast. We, obviously, very much like the technology. We do think it's a disruptive technology but we have to prove its manufacturability and cost effectiveness. And that's what we're going to be doing over the coming quarters. As we get closer to introducing that as a capability to the marketplace, we'll update you on how we think it's going to change the fabrication of solar panels. On the litho-etch-litho-etch or self-aligned double patterning, I don't think there's a whole lot of difference for us. We still win in the thin film depositions. And there's going to be a mix of these things and it's hard to exactly tell how it's all going to shake out, litho-etch-litho-etch, obviously, better for logic. And self-aligned maybe better for flash memory. But I think we're going to see how this  the adoption rate goes over the next year.

A couple of questions. First, on the consolidation of the supply chain and manufacturing, I just want to be clear, do you expect to net increase or decrease your use of outside partners or could we actually see an increase in your own vertical integration over the next 12 months?
 
Mike Splinter
- Applied Materials - Chairman & CEO
I don't think you'll be seeing an increase in our vertical integration. I think what we want to do is look across our supply chain. We want to ensure that we're working with the suppliers that both have the right technology and can stay with us in this very volatile business. And we're going to be doing an awful lot of that in Asia as Singapore ramps up and for semiconductors and Tainan ramps up for our large footprint equipment. But certainly, in this kind of a business, we're looking to make ourselves more variable and have more variable costs, not less.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 16, 2009, Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Applied Materials"), Jupiter Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Montana corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Materials ("Acquisition Sub"), and Semitool, Inc., a Montana Corporation ("Semitool"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") that contemplates the acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of Semitool. Semitool is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by chip packaging and chip making companies around the world.
The Merger Agreement provides that Acquisition Sub will commence a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Semitool at a price of $11.00 per share (such price, or any other price per share that is paid in the Offer, referred to as the "Offer Price"), without interest thereon and subject to any required withholding taxes.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub will commence the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement. The obligation of Applied Materials to cause Acquisition Sub to accept for payment any shares of Semitool common stock in the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including that: (i) more than 66.67% of the shares of common stock outstanding (determined on a fully-diluted basis using a formula set forth in the Merger Agreement) shall have been validly tendered (and not withdrawn); and (ii) the waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws, including in the U.S. and Germany, have expired.
The Merger Agreement also provides that after completion of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will be merged with Semitool, and the surviving corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Materials (the "Merger"). Upon completion of the Merger, all remaining outstanding shares of Semitool common stock not tendered in the Offer (other than shares that are: (i) held by Applied Materials, Acquisition Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Materials or Acquisition Sub; (ii) held by Semitool or any of its subsidiaries; or (iii) held by shareholders of Semitool, if any, who properly exercise their dissenters' rights under Montana law) will be acquired for cash at the Offer Price and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
As an inducement to Applied Materials and Acquisition Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, on November 16, 2009, Applied Materials and Acquisition Sub entered into separate Tender and Support Agreements (the "Tender Agreements") with each of the directors and executive officers of Semitool (the "Shareholders"). Pursuant to the Tender Agreements, the Shareholders agreed to tender their shares of Semitool common stock pursuant to the Offer and, if necessary, vote them in favor of the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions in the Tender Agreements and the Merger Agreement. As of November 16, 2009, the Shareholders collectively beneficially own or have the power to vote approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of Semitool common stock.
Important Information about the Tender Offer
This announcement is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, shares of Semitool. Holders of shares of Semitool are urged to read the relevant tender offer documents when they become available because they will contain important information that holders of Semitool securities should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities. At the time the offer is commenced, Applied Materials and its acquisition subsidiary will file tender offer materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and Semitool will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement with respect to the offer. The tender offer materials (including an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal and certain other offer documents) and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and certain other offer documents, as well as the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, will be made available to all holders of shares of Semitool at no expense to them. The tender offer materials and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will be made available for free at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Free copies of these documents may also be obtained by mailing a request to the information agent for the tender offer, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10022; by calling toll free at (877) 687-1875 (shareholders) or collect at (212) 750-5833 (banks and brokers); and at www.appliedmaterials.com and www.semitool.com.

Exhibit 99.1
Santa Clara, Calif. and Kalispell, Mont., Nov. 17, 2009  Applied Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMAT) and Semitool, Inc. (Nasdaq:SMTL) today announced a definitive agreement for Applied to acquire the outstanding shares of Semitool for $11 per share in an all-cash tender offer.
The acquisition makes Applied the equipment leader in two fast-growing segments: advanced packaging and the memory industry's conversion to copper. The combination enables Applied to serve its customers with a broader range of products and expands the company's reach to a new set of customers in the semiconductor packaging industry.
"The semiconductor industry recovery is being fueled by global demand for mobile devices such as smart phones, notebook PCs and portable media players for music, gaming and books," said Mike Splinter, chairman and CEO of Applied Materials. "With this acquisition, Applied will help the world's leading chip makers create ever-smaller and more powerful devices."
"Applied Materials and Semitool have a strong track record of collaborating to develop equipment solutions for leading chip makers," said Randhir Thakur, senior vice president and general manager of Applied's Silicon Systems Group. "Together with Semitool's people and products, we can help the industry move to smaller form factors and faster, lower power chips."
"As part of Applied Materials, we can accelerate the global adoption of the technologies Semitool has developed," said Ray Thompson, chairman of Semitool. "With this agreement, we are providing our employees with a strong future and our stockholders with exceptional value."
Headquartered in Kalispell, Mont., Semitool is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by chip packaging and chip making companies around the world.
Under terms of an agreement approved by the boards of directors of both companies, Applied Materials will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately $364 million based on the fully diluted capitalization of Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted pursuant to a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the tender of at least 66

percent of Semitool's outstanding stock on a fully-diluted basis and other customary closing conditions including regulatory approval. Directors and executive officers of Semitool holding approximately 32 percent of Semitool's outstanding common stock have entered into agreements
to tender their shares. Applied expects to commence the tender offer promptly and expects the offer to close by the end of calendar 2009. Following completion of the tender offer, Applied will acquire any remaining shares of Semitool through a second-step merger at the same price paid in the tender offer. Semitool will be operated as a business unit of Applied's Silicon Systems Group.

(d) On December 7, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") appointed Susan M. James to serve as a member of the Board and as a member of the Board's Audit Committee, effective immediately.
Pursuant to the terms of Applied's Employee Stock Incentive Plan, Ms. James was automatically granted 3,845 performance shares (or restricted stock units) on December 7, 2009, the day of her appointment. These performance shares are scheduled to vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, subject to Ms. James' continued service as a director on each such installment date. Ms. James will also participate in the standard non-employee director compensation arrangements described in Applied's 2009 Proxy Statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2009, as updated by Item 8.01 below.
(e)(1) On December 7, 2009, the Board approved a "clawback" policy that will apply to certain officers of Applied, including (but not limited to) Michael R. Splinter, President and Chief Executive Officer; Franz Janker, Executive Vice President, Corporate Account Manager; George S. Davis, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Manfred Kerschbaum, Senior Vice President, Chief of Staff; and Mark R. Pinto, Senior Vice President, General Manager Energy and Environmental Solutions and Display and Chief Technology Officer. These individuals are Applied's named executive officers (the "NEOs").
Under the policy, if the Board determines that a material negative restatement of Applied's financial results was caused primarily by an NEO's intentional misconduct, then the Board may require reimbursement of any portion of the bonus and performance-based equity awards ("performance-based awards") that the NEO would not have received if Applied's financial results had been reported properly. The policy applies to financial statements filed in a rolling three-year look-back period. The Board administers the policy and determines, in its sole discretion, the amount of compensation to be reimbursed. The policy applies to bonuses paid and performance-based awards (whether or not vested) for which performance goals have been achieved within 12 months following the release of Applied's filed financial statements that become subject to a material negative restatement.
 
On December 8, 2009, Applied issued a press release announcing the appointment of Susan M. James to the Board. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit, is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Applied under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.
In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 13, 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Applied announced a twenty percent (20%) reduction in the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors of the Board.
On December 7, 2009, the Board's Human Resources and Compensation Committee approved the termination of the 20% reduction in the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors of the Board, effective immediately. As a result, the non-employee directors' annual cash retainer has been reinstated to $65,000, the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors of the Board in effect prior to the 20% reduction. This termination of the 20% reduction in non-employee directors' compensation is consistent with the previously-announced termination of a 20% reduction in base salary for Applied's NEOs.

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 17, 2010  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT), the global leader in Nanomanufacturing Technology solutions for the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar industries, today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended January 31, 2010. Applied generated net sales of $1.85 billion, operating profit of $116 million, and net income of $83 million or $0.06 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $179 million or $0.13 per share.
"Applied posted solid first quarter results led by robust sales in our semiconductor equipment business," said Mike Splinter, chairman and CEO. "With global demand improving in our customers' end markets, we are raising our full-year revenue target to reflect higher anticipated demand in our semiconductor, LCD display and crystalline silicon solar businesses."
"During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Semitool Inc., opening new growth opportunities in our core semiconductor equipment market, particularly in advanced packaging," Splinter added. "Applied enters its second quarter with considerable momentum, and we are off to an excellent start for the year."
Financial Results Summary
Fiscal year 2010 is a 53-week year with 14 weeks in the first quarter.
The non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: restructuring and asset impairments, acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, gains on sales of facilities, and amounts associated with the resolution of income tax audits. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of equity-
 
Applied Materials, Inc. Page 2 of 8
based compensation. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statements included in this release.
Reportable Segment Results
The Silicon Systems Group (SSG) had new orders of $1.13 billion, net sales of $970 million and operating income of $306 million. The 48 percent sequential increase in net sales was led by shipments to foundry and DRAM customers. New order composition was: foundry 42 percent, DRAM 36 percent, flash 13 percent, and logic and other 9 percent.
Applied Global Services (AGS) had new orders of $474 million, net sales of $426 million and operating income of $63 million. Sequential growth in net sales of 9 percent was driven primarily by semiconductor customer increases in factory utilization levels and new wafer starts.
The Display group had new orders of $126 million, net sales of $132 million and operating income of $25 million. The sequential decline in net sales was expected following a strong prior quarter.
The Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) group had new orders of $230 million, net sales of $321 million and an operating loss of $36 million. Net sales included revenue for two additional SunFab thin film solar production lines.
Financial Highlights
Applied generated operating cash flow of $367 million during the quarter. The company acquired Semitool Inc. in an all-cash transaction for $323 million, net of cash acquired, and paid cash dividends of $80 million. At the end of the period, the company held $3.2 billion in cash and investments.
Business Outlook
For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied expects quarter over quarter net sales growth of between 15 percent and 25 percent. The company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.22, which excludes anticipated charges related primarily to acquisitions.
For fiscal 2010, Applied expects net sales to grow by more than 50 percent, an increase from the previous outlook of greater than 30 percent.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied
 
Applied Materials, Inc. Page 3 of 8
Materials believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2010  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT), the global leader in Nanomanufacturing Technology solutions for the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar industries, today reported results for its second quarter of fiscal 2010 ended May 2, 2010. Applied generated net sales of $2.30 billion, operating profit of $386 million, and net income of $264 million or $0.20 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million or $0.22 per share.
"Applied's stronger second quarter results were led by revenue and profitability gains in our silicon and flat panel display businesses," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer. "Global demand for computing and consumer electronics is giving our customers the confidence to make significant capacity additions, fueling what we believe will be a multiyear growth cycle. During the quarter, we announced a 17 percent increase in our quarterly dividend and resumed our stock repurchase program."
"Our results were at the high end of our expectations despite an inventory charge for thin film solar equipment that lowered the gross profit margin by 3.6 percentage points or approximately $0.04 per share," said George Davis, chief financial officer.
Financial Results Summary
Fiscal year 2010 is a 53-week year with 14 weeks in the first quarter.
 
Applied Materials, Inc. Page 2 of 9
The non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: restructuring and asset impairments, certain acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, and amounts associated with the resolution of income tax audits. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of equity-based compensation. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statements included in this release.
Reportable Segment Results
Silicon had new orders of $1.42 billion, net sales of $1.40 billion and operating income of $498 million. The net sales increase of 45 percent over the first quarter reflected higher shipments to foundry and DRAM customers along with the addition of Semitool. New order composition was: DRAM 41 percent, foundry 37 percent, logic and other 12 percent, and flash 10 percent.
Applied Global Services (AGS) had new orders of $483 million. Net sales were $456 million, up 7 percent sequentially, and operating income was $90 million.
The Display group had new orders of $256 million, net sales of $270 million and operating income of $90 million. Net sales more than doubled over the first quarter primarily driven by Generation 8.5 system shipments.
The Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) group had new orders of $378 million. Net sales were $166 million, down 48 percent from the first quarter, primarily due to lower thin film revenue. EES had an operating loss of $145 million, which included an $83 million inventory charge related to thin film solar manufacturing equipment.
Additional Quarterly Financial Information
Business Outlook
For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied expects net sales to be in the range of down two percent to up five percent quarter over quarter. The company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 which excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of approximately $0.01 per share. This outlook does not take into account other non-GAAP adjustments that may arise subsequent to this release.
 
Applied Materials, Inc. Page 3 of 9
On March 30, 2010, Applied raised its fiscal year net sales outlook to growth of more than 60 percent over fiscal 2009.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied Materials believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Webcast Information
Applied Materials will discuss these results during an earnings call that begins at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. A live webcast will be available at .

On July 20, 2010, a committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied or the Company) approved a plan (the EES Plan) to restructure the Company's Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) segment. The action is in response to market conditions for thin film solar, including delays in utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers' challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy polices, and competitive pressure from crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar technologies. The restructuring will enable EES to focus on Applied's c-Si solar business and on pursuing other opportunities in advanced energy technologies, including light emitting diode (LED) technology.
As part of the restructuring, Applied will discontinue sales to new customers of its SunFab fully-integrated lines for manufacturing thin film PV panels and will begin offering individual tools for sale to thin film solar manufacturers, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) equipment. R&D efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and high-productivity deposition will continue. The Company will support existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment. Applied's solar R&D center in Xi'an, China will concentrate on advancing its c-Si solar and other emerging technologies. The Company also plans to divest its low-emissivity architectural glass coating products, while continuing development activities in emerging technologies such as "smart" electrochromic glass.
The total estimated cost of implementing the EES Plan is expected to be in the range of approximately $375 million to $425 million, or $0.18 to $0.21 per share, which will be reported as cost of products sold and restructuring and asset impairments in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. As part of the total pre-tax cost, Applied anticipates that it will record: (i) inventory charges of up to $240 million; (ii) equipment and intangible assets impairment charges of up to $95 million; (iii) employee severance of up to $50 million; and (iv) other obligations of up to $40 million. This action will impact between 400 to 500 positions globally. A number of affected employees may transfer to other groups or functions within the Company. Cash expenditures related to severance and other obligations are expected to be no more than $80 million. Applied does not anticipate any cash outlays associated with the equipment and intangible asset impairments.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.
 
On July 21, 2010, Applied issued a press release announcing the EES Plan, an adjustment to a prior restructuring plan, and revised targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 7.01 and in Exhibit 99.1 is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Applied under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to the expected scope, costs, timing and benefits of the EES Plan. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such
statements, including but not limited to: uncertain global economic and industry conditions; Applied's ability to implement the program as planned and achieve the anticipated benefits, which may be affected by: customer requirements, changes in business conditions and/or operational needs, business acquisitions or divestitures, retention of key employees, U.S. and international labor and employment laws, delays and increased costs; the ability to accurately forecast financial results; and other risks described in Applied's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 21, 2010  Applied Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMAT) today announced plans to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) segment to put a primary emphasis on opportunities in crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar and advanced energy, including light emitting diode (LED) technology. Upon completion of the restructuring plan, annual operating expenses are expected to decrease by at least $100 million on an annualized basis. The restructuring plan is intended to make EES a profitable segment in fiscal year 2011.
As part of the restructuring, Applied will discontinue sales to new customers of its SunFab fully-integrated lines for manufacturing thin film solar panels and will offer individual tools for sale to thin film solar manufacturers, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) equipment. R&D efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and high-productivity deposition will continue. The company will support existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment. Applied's solar R&D center in Xi'an, China will concentrate on advancing its c-Si solar and other technologies.
"While Applied has delivered significant innovations with our SunFab production line and made substantial progress on our technology roadmap, the thin film market has been negatively impacted by several factors, including delays in utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers' challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy policies, and competitive pressure from crystalline silicon technologies," said Mike Splinter, chairman and CEO of Applied Materials. "Led by Mark Pinto, EES will focus on our industry-leading crystalline silicon solar business and on pursuing other opportunities in advanced energy technologies like LED lighting."
The company also plans to divest its low-emissivity architectural glass coating products, while continuing development activities in emerging technologies such as "smart" electrochromic glass.
The cost of implementing the EES restructuring plan is expected to be in the range of approximately $375 million to $425 million, or $0.18 to $0.21 per share, which will be reported as cost of products sold and restructuring and asset impairments in the company's consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. As part of the total pre-tax cost, Applied anticipates that it will record: (i) inventory charges of up to $240 million; (ii) equipment and intangible assets impairment charges of up to $95 million; (iii) employee severance of up to $50 million; and (iv) other obligations of up to $40 million. This action is expected to impact between 400 to 500 positions globally. A number of affected employees may transfer to other groups or functions within the company. Cash expenditures related to these charges are expected to be no more than $80 million. In addition to the charges under the EES plan, the company will record a favorable adjustment of approximately $20 million to the restructuring plan previously announced on November 11, 2009 due to changes in business requirements.

Revised Q3 FY2010 Business Outlook
In May, the company announced its target for non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 of between $0.22 and $0.26 per share, which did not include any potential restructuring charges. The revised target is for non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 to $0.14 per share, which would have been at the high end of the previous target after taking into account the approximately $0.14 per share impact of the inventory charges and other obligations related to today's actions.

On November 12, 2009, Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied or the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Initial Filing) that included, in Item 2.05 thereof, disclosure regarding the Company's implementation of a global restructuring plan (the Plan) intended to better align the Company's cost structure and capabilities with industry changes, market conditions and opportunities. The Initial Filing stated that Applied expected to reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to 12 percent, and that Applied expected to complete implementation of the Plan by May 2011. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied took a pre-tax charge associated with the Plan in the amount of $104 million for employment termination benefits to be paid in cash.
Due to changes in business requirements, Applied currently expects that reductions in its global workforce pursuant to the Plan will be approximately 1,000 positions and expects to incur total charges associated with the Plan of approximately $84 million, to be paid in cash. Accordingly, Applied will record a favorable adjustment of $20 million during its third fiscal quarter ending August 1, 2010.

"Applied had strong results across our semiconductor, display and crystalline silicon solar businesses, and we now expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be up by more than 160 percent over fiscal 2009," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer. "During the quarter, we took actions that focus our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment on our most promising opportunities in solar and advanced energy, and strengthen our company's financial outlook."
The EES restructuring plan announced on July 21, 2010 resulted in charges totaling $405 million. These charges consisted of inventory-related charges of approximately $250 million and severance and asset impairment charges of $155 million. The inventory-related charges lowered gross margin by approximately 10 percentage points and reduced GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.12. Excluding the EES restructuring plan charges, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.29.
Applied's May business outlook was for non-GAAP EPS of between $0.22 and $0.26. At the announcement of the EES restructuring plan on July 21, 2010, the non-GAAP EPS outlook was revised to between $0.10 and $0.14.
Financial Results Summary
The non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: restructuring and asset impairments, certain acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, and amounts associated with the resolution of income tax audits. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the non-GAAP results no longer

On November 29, 2010, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into a Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). The Agreement resolves potential civil claims and removes the risk of civil litigation between the parties relating to the alleged acquisition, misappropriation and misuse of Samsung confidential semiconductor information in Korea that is the subject of criminal proceedings pending against employees of several companies, including current and former Applied Materials Korea employees, in the Seoul Eastern District Court of the Republic of Korea (the "Korea proceedings"). Neither Applied nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in the Korea proceedings. The settlement terms of the Agreement pertain to potential civil claims between the parties and are separate from and do not affect criminal proceedings against individual defendants, including but not limited to the individuals charged in the Korea proceedings.
Under the Agreement, which is generally effective for a three-year period starting November 1, 2010, Applied will provide volume-based rebates on purchases of semiconductor products by Samsung and its affiliated companies. Applied also will provide volume-based incentives related to Samsung's use of Applied systems (i) for production of semiconductor devices in applications for which Samsung has not previously used Applied systems, and (ii) for joint development activities. In addition, the Agreement includes volume-based credits for certain upgrades, engineering services and spare parts. The financial impact of the above rebates and incentives on Applied's consolidated results of operations and financial position will depend on the volume of purchases by Samsung after the effective date of the Agreement. In fiscal 2009, Samsung accounted for approximately 10% of Applied's consolidated net sales.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to future business activities and the financial impact of the Agreement. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation: the volume of Samsung's purchases of Applied semiconductor products; Applied's ability to accurately forecast the financial impact of the Agreement, which depends on multiple factors; and other risks described in Applied's SEC filings, including its most recent Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date of this report, and Applied undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.
 
On November 29, 2010, Applied issued a press release announcing the entry into the Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 3, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Applied"), Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied ("Merger Sub"), and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Varian"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Merger Sub will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into Varian (the "Merger"), with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied. Varian designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment and is the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips. The boards of directors of each of Applied and Varian have unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
Upon the Merger becoming effective (the "Effective Time"), by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Applied, Merger Sub, Varian or any stockholder of Varian, each share of Varian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $63 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (excluding shares that are: (i) held by Applied, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied; (ii) held by Varian or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Varian (or held in Varian's treasury); or (iii) held by stockholders of Varian, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law). At the Effective Time, certain equity awards held by employees of Varian will be converted into cash equal to the difference between the Merger Consideration and the exercise price, if any, of such awards, while other equity awards held by employees of Varian will be assumed by Applied and converted into equity awards of Applied on substantially equivalent terms.
The completion of the Merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Varian entitled to vote thereon, as well as receipt of certain domestic and foreign antitrust approvals (including under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended).
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by Applied, Merger Sub and Varian. Varian has agreed, among other things, not to solicit any offer or proposal for a competing or alternative transaction, or, subject to certain exceptions, to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any competing or alternative transaction. In addition, certain covenants require each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated. The Merger Agreement also requires Varian to call and hold a stockholders' meeting and, subject to certain exceptions, requires the board of directors of Varian to recommend approval of the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that (i) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, by Varian to accept a superior offer or by Applied upon a change in the recommendation of Varian's board of directors, Varian will owe Applied a cash termination fee of $147 million; and (ii) upon termination of the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain certain antitrust approvals, Applied will owe Varian a cash termination fee of $200 million.
Table of Contents
Applied expects to finance the Merger through a combination of existing cash balances and debt. For further information regarding financing commitments obtained by Applied, see Item 8.01 below.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Varian or Applied. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in a confidential Disclosure Schedule provided by Varian to Applied in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. This confidential Disclosure Schedule contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Varian and Applied rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Varian or Applied.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 4, 2011, Applied and Varian issued a joint press release announcing execution of the Merger Agreement, the text of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit, is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of Applied under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
Applied has received certain financing commitments in connection with the Merger, as described below.
On May 3, 2011, Applied entered into a commitment letter (the "Bridge Facility Commitment Letter") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. (collectively, the "Commitment Parties"). Pursuant to the Bridge Facility Commitment Letter, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (or their affiliates) have committed to provide a one-year senior bridge term loan facility in the amount of up to $2.0 billion to be available to fund a portion of the cash consideration to be paid by Applied in the Merger. The commitment is subject to customary closing conditions. Applied plans to arrange long-term debt financing.
Applied has in place an undrawn $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Existing Credit Facility") entered into with Citicorp USA, Inc. and certain other lenders, which is scheduled to expire on January 26, 2012 and which was previously disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2007 and May 22, 2009. On May 3, 2011, Applied and the Commitment Parties entered into a second commitment letter (the "Credit Facility Commitment Letter") for another credit facility to be available to fund a portion of the cash consideration to be paid by Applied in the Merger and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility Commitment Letter provides for the Commitment Parties to use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange a new four-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that would replace the Existing Credit Facility. The commitment is subject to customary closing conditions.

reputable bank or trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "").

Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 1.5 shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.7(c). To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 1.5, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under Section 1.5.

Payment Fund
provided
               Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates or uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry ("") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent, or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Uncertificated Shares: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares or Uncertificated Shares is registered if: (1) any such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest
(b) 
Uncertificated Shares
 
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or in respect of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.7.
               Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including holders of Company Stock Certificates) as of the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including holders of Company Stock Certificates) who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration.
(c) 
               Each of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Award such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
(d) 
               If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(e) 
               None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.
(f) 
          .
1.8 Dissenting Shares
               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "" until such time as such holder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.

All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Continuing Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (1) each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Continuing Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (3) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Continuing Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (4) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Continuing Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Continuing Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Continuing Option(except that Parent's board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company's board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Continuing Option);provided, however, that if the employment of any Continuing Employee (other than a Person who has entered into one of the change-in-control agreements set forth in Part 2.14(f) of the Disclosure Schedule) is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation other than for Cause, death or disability, in all such cases occurring within one year of the Closing, all Continuing Options held by such Continuing Employee shall (at termination of employment) immediately vest as to an additional 12 months of vesting.

Parent shall waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent benefit program that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs.
(b) 
               Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent.

The Company also shall take such other actions reasonably connected to terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request in good faith. If the Company knows that the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k) Plan that is terminated pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) are reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any participating employer, then the Company shall make a good faith reasonable estimate of the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its estimate of that amount in writing to Parent at least two business days prior to the Closing Date.

Santa Clara, Calif. and Gloucester, Mass. May 4, 2011  Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") (Nasdaq: AMAT) and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") (Nasdaq: VSEA) today announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Applied will acquire Varian for $63 per share in cash for a total price of approximately $4.9 billion on a fully-diluted basis. The price represents a 55 percent premium to yesterday's closing price, or a 38 percent premium to Varian's 30 day average closing price. Varian is the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers around the world. Following the close of the transaction, Varian will operate as a business unit of Applied's Silicon Systems Group and continue to be based in Gloucester, Mass. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Applied's earnings on a non-GAAP basis in the first year.
The acquisition will extend Applied's leadership in wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) with the addition of the technology leader in ion implantation  a critical step in integrated circuit manufacturing. Varian's ion implant products complement Applied's Silicon Systems Group's successful suite of products in the areas of transistor, interconnect, wafer level packaging and patterning. The combined company will provide customers a broad product portfolio for transistor formation, enabling the manufacture of higher performance chips particularly for mobile applications with faster speeds and longer battery life. In addition, Varian's technology has strong potential to extend into adjacent markets, including solar, display and light emitting diodes.
"Varian is a great fit for our strategy to profitably grow share in our core semiconductor business with best-in-class technology and talent," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer of Applied. "The pace of product innovation is accelerating, requiring devices that are more mobile, more connected and more personalized. These global trends are driving our customers to find new solutions for smaller transistors and faster and higher performance chips, while pushing the boundaries of innovation. Combined, Applied and Varian will be better positioned to help our customers solve these complex challenges and deliver long-term value to shareholders."
"We believe the opportunity is very attractive for Varian's customers, employees and shareholders," said Varian's chief executive officer Gary Dickerson. "In addition to our
 
combined strengths in the semiconductor space, Applied's proven capability to extend its technology to adjacent markets like solar and display can help unlock the tremendous potential of ion implantation in these markets."
"Trends in chip complexity, transistor scaling and 3-D design are driving growth in the ion implantation market. Applied's broad capability in semiconductor equipment and Varian's ion implant expertise will allow us to work more closely with our customers on integrated process solutions at the transistor level," said Dr. Randhir Thakur, executive vice president and general manager of Applied's Silicon Systems Group. "We are excited to welcome Varian's highly talented team with a history of successful innovation, execution and customer focus."
The merger received unanimous approval by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Varian shareholders will receive $63 in cash for each share of Varian stock they hold at the time of closing. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Varian's shareholders and review by U.S. and international regulators.
Applied expects to fund the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. Applied has secured a commitment for a $2 billion, one-year senior bridge loan facility and plans to arrange for long-term debt financing. Applied also has in place an existing, undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Additional financing arrangements are expected to include replacement of the existing credit facility with a new four-year, $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. Applied remains committed to a strong investment grade capital structure.
Conference Call and Webcast
Applied and Varian will discuss the announcement on a webcast and conference call today beginning at 5:30 a.m. PDT, 8:30 a.m. EDT.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") disclosed that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 3, 2011, pursuant to which Applied agreed to acquire Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") for $63 per share in cash (the "Merger"). In addition, Applied disclosed that it had received certain financing commitments in connection with the Merger. Applied has now executed definitive financing agreements, as described further below.
Bridge Loan Agreement
On May 25, 2011, Applied entered into a Bridge Loan Agreement (the "Bridge Loan Agreement") for a U.S.$2,000,000,000 term loan facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan") as administrative agent; Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley") and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") as syndication agents; and other lenders named therein (collectively, the "Bridge Lenders").
Under the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Bridge Lenders have severally agreed to make unsecured loans (the "Bridge Loans") of up to U.S.$2,000,000,000 in the aggregate on the closing date (the "Merger Closing Date") of Applied's planned acquisition of Varian. The Bridge Loans, if any are borrowed by Applied under the agreement, will fund a portion of the cash consideration to be paid by Applied in the Merger. Any unused commitments of the Bridge Lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement shall expire on the earlier of the Merger Closing Date or April 30, 2012. The Bridge Loans will bear interest at one of various rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin varies according to Applied's public debt rating and the duration of time that the Bridge Loans are outstanding. The Bridge Loan Agreement also requires Applied to pay certain customary fees and expenses. Applied may repay Bridge Loans at any time without penalty, except for a customary breakage fee for Bridge Loans that bear interest at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The Bridge Loans, once repaid by Applied, may not be re-borrowed.
The Bridge Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type. Affirmative covenants include, among other things, with respect to Applied and its subsidiaries, compliance with environmental laws and other laws; payment obligations; maintenance of material properties, books of record and account and insurance; preservation of existence; and delivery of financial statements, compliance certificates and notices. Negative covenants include, among other things, with respect to Applied and its subsidiaries, limitations on liens, changes in the nature of business, and transactions with affiliates; and with respect to Applied, limitations on consolidations, mergers or the sale or lease of all or substantially all of Applied's assets. The Bridge Loan Agreement also requires maintenance of a ratio of: (i) consolidated funded debt to (ii) consolidated funded debt plus consolidated shareholders' equity.
If certain events of default occur or conditions are not satisfied, the Bridge Lenders would be permitted to terminate their commitments to advance the Bridge Loans. The Bridge Loan Agreement further specifies certain customary events of default, including, among other things, a failure to comply with covenants; inaccuracy in any material respect of representations, warranties, or certifications in the Bridge Loan Agreement or in any financial statement or other document delivered thereunder; a failure to pay certain financial obligations; certain change of control events; a default under specified debt obligations; or the occurrence of certain ERISA, insolvency or bankruptcy events. An event of default would permit the Bridge Lenders to require immediate repayment of the Bridge Loans.
The maturity date of the Bridge Loan Agreement is the first anniversary of the Merger Closing Date, at which time all outstanding Bridge Loans, if any, will become due and payable. Applied is required to prepay the Bridge Loans with, and any unused commitments of the Bridge Lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement will be reduced by, the net proceeds received from certain asset sales, certain recoveries for property losses, and certain new debt or equity issuances by Applied.
 
Credit Agreement
On May 25, 2011, Applied also entered into a four-year U.S.$1,500,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan as administrative agent; Morgan Stanley, Citibank, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. as syndication agents; and other lenders named therein (collectively, the "Revolving Facility Lenders").
The Credit Agreement provides for unsecured borrowings (advances) not to exceed U.S. $1,500,000,000 at any one time outstanding and includes a sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $400,000,000 outstanding at any one time for the account of Applied and its subsidiaries. Advances under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at one of various rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin varies according to Applied's public debt rating. The Credit Agreement also requires Applied to pay certain customary fees and expenses. Applied may repay advances at any time without penalty, except for a customary LIBOR breakage fee for advances that bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR, and it may reborrow under the Credit Agreement subject to specified terms and conditions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type that are similar to the affirmative and negative covenants in the Bridge Loan Agreement, including maintenance of a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated funded debt plus consolidated shareholders' equity.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default similar to the events of default under the Bridge Loan Agreement. A default under the Credit Agreement would permit the Revolving Facility Lenders to terminate their commitments to advance funds to Applied and to require immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement is available to fund a portion of the cash consideration to be paid by Applied in the Merger and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on May 25, 2015, at which time all outstanding amounts thereunder, if any, will become due and payable.
The Credit Agreement replaces a five-year $1,000,000,000 Credit Agreement dated January 26, 2007 by and among Applied and certain lenders, as amended on May 22, 2009, as described further in Item 1.02 below.
JPMorgan and the other Bridge Lenders and Revolving Facility Lenders, and certain of their affiliates, have engaged in, and/or in the future may engage in, banking and other transactions with Applied, including previous credit facilities. These parties have received, and/or in the future may receive, customary compensation from Applied for these services.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 26, 2007, Applied entered into a five-year U.S.$1,000,000,000 Credit Agreement with certain lenders, which was amended on May 22, 2009 and which was due to expire on January 26, 2012 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"). Entry into the Prior Credit Agreement was previously disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2007 and May 22, 2009, which are incorporated herein by this reference. On May 25, 2011, the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated and replaced by the Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01 above. There were no outstanding amounts due under the Prior Credit Agreement.

prima facie
provided
(e) Any Lender may request, through the Administrative Agent, that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon the Maturity Date; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued

interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 2.11If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
. Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
Section 2.12(a) If any Change in Law shall:
. Increased Costs; Illegality.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) If after the date of this Agreement, a Change in Law shall subject any Lender to any Taxes as a result of a change in the basis of taxation by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (other than (i) Taxes due to a change in the rate of taxation or (ii) Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made by any Borrower hereunder and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, and the result shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then such Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(d) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim and the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
 
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided further
(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain in the London interbank market the funding for Eurodollar Loans, then (i) such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (ii) the obligation of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans and to continue Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith terminate, and (iii) such Lender's Eurodollar Loans then outstanding shall be converted on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans (or on such earlier date as may be required by law) to ABR Loans.
Section 2.13In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.08(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss (other than loss of applicable margin), cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
. Break Funding Payments.

. Taxes.
 
that if the Borrower shall be required by law (or by the interpretation or administration thereof) to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including deductions of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14(a)) the Administrative Agent or any Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, which written demand shall be made within 60 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender received written demand for payment of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from the relevant Governmental Authority, for the full amount of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes properly imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.14(c)) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount shall have been determined, delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of such payment or liability absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to any Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date such Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its Applicable Lending Office (i) two duly executed and properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN (with respect to the benefit of an income tax treaty), or successor forms, certifying to such Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents, or (ii) if such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either (x) the forms referred to in clause (i) above certifying to such
 
Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents, or (y) two duly executed and properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN (or successor forms) and a duly executed certificate substantially in the form of (any such certificate, a ""); that in the event that a Foreign Lender is not classified as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, such Foreign Lender shall take any actions necessary and shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent all additional (or alternative) Internal Revenue Service forms and Section 2.14(e) Certificates necessary to fully establish such Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax on all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents (including causing its partners, members, beneficiaries or owners, or their beneficial owners, to take any actions and deliver any Internal Revenue Service forms and Section 2.14(e) Certificates necessary to establish such exemption). In addition, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such Internal Revenue Service forms and the Section 2.14(e) Certificate (as applicable) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly upon the obsolescence, inaccuracy or invalidity of any such Internal Revenue Service forms or Section 2.14(e) Certificate previously delivered by such Foreign Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(e) unless such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver such Internal Revenue Service forms or Section 2.14(e) Certificate.
Exhibit D
Section 2.14(e) Certificate
provided
(f) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Assignment and Assumption would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14(f), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g) Each Lender agrees that, before making a demand under this Section 2.14, it shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates if the making of such a designation or assignment will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any additional amounts that would otherwise thereafter accrue and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, require such Lender to incur a cost or expense, or legal or regulatory disadvantage, determined by such Lender
 
to be material. Upon any such change in any Applicable Lending Office or assignment, such Lender shall provide or cause to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the appropriate form specified in Section 2.14(e).
(h) If the Borrower pays any additional amount or indemnity payment pursuant to this Section 2.14 with respect to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other recipient, the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax liabilities on account of such payment; that the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, shall have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax credit position, (ii) it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it or (iii) no such refund or credit is available under applicable laws. In the event that the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, receives such a refund or credit, the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the Borrower an amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, as a result of such payment by the Borrower. Nothing contained in this Section 2.14(h) shall require the Administrative Agent or such Lender or other recipient, as the case may be, to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any net tax benefit or its determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.14(h) to the Borrower or any other party.
provided
(i) Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes; that, in the judgment of the Borrower, such steps shall not subject the Borrower to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Borrower.
provided
Section 2.15(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent, except that payments pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 or 8.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is
. Payment Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
 
not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including
 
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.15(d) or 8.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
Section 2.16(a) If any Lender becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would entitle such Lender to receive any compensation from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12 or that would require the Borrower to make a payment to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then (unless in the case of Section 2.12 such Lender determines in its discretion not to request compensation therefor) such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.14 in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If any Lender (i) requests compensation under Section 2.12, (ii) requests that the Borrower make a payment to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, (iii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iv) becomes an Affected Lender, or (v) refuses to consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Document requested by the Borrower that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders and such amendment, waiver or other modification is consented to by the Required Lenders; then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.04, with the Borrower or the replacement Lender paying the processing and recording fee), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (w) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent to such assignment, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,
provided
 
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) (in the case of a Defaulting Lender, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any amount to which such Defaulting Lender is not entitled in accordance with Section 2.17), (y) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14 such assignment will result in a reduction in or elimination of such compensation or payments in the future and (z) in the case of clause (v) above, such assignee consents to such amendment, waiver or other modification. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that an assignment required to be made by it pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto.
Section 2.17If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
. Defaulting Lenders.
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a); and
(b) the Commitment and Loan Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification permitted to be effected by the Required Lenders pursuant to Section 8.02) and, notwithstanding Section 8.02, any such Defaulting Lender shall not have the right to vote on or consent to any amendment or waiver under this Agreement if such amendment or waiver does not disproportionately in an adverse manner affect the rights of such Defaulting Lender or increase or extend such Defaulting Lender's Commitment hereunder.
Section 3.01The Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement shall become effective on and as of the first date (the "") on which the following conditions precedent have been satisfied:
. Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of Commitments.

Borrower
    
Loan Agreement
In connection with this opinion, I have examined executed copies of the Loan Agreement and the Notes and such other documents, records, agreements and certificates as I have deemed appropriate. I have also reviewed such matters of law as I have considered relevant for the purpose of this opinion.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the corporate power and authority to own its assets and to transact the business in which it is now engaged or proposes to be engaged.
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or, to the best of my knowledge, of (i) any judgment, injunction, order or decree or (ii) any material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Borrower, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower.
3. To the best of my knowledge, except as set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in the Borrower's 2010 Form 10-K and other SEC filings filed by the Borrower prior to the date of this opinion, there are no pending or threatened actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental
agency or arbitrator in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination which would have a Material Adverse Effect, or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Loan Agreement or the Notes.
Certain Assumptions
With your permission I have assumed the following: (a) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (b) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies and the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates I have reviewed; and (c) the absence of any evidence extrinsic to the provisions of the written agreements between the parties that the parties intended a meaning contrary to that expressed by those provisions.
Certain Limitations and Qualifications
I express no opinion as to laws other than laws of the State of California, the federal law of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. I am licensed to practice law only in the State of California.
The phrase "to the best of my knowledge" is intended to indicate that, during the course of the performance of my duties as Vice President, Legal Affairs, of the Borrower, no information that would give me current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement has come to my attention.
Use of Opinion
This opinion is solely for your benefit (and the benefit of any assignee) in connection with the transaction covered by the first paragraph of this letter and may not be relied upon, used, circulated, quoted or referred to, nor may copies hereof be delivered to, any other person without my prior written approval. I disclaim any obligation to update this opinion for events occurring or coming to my attention after the date hereof.

perform such Loan Documents to which it is a party; (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise) on the part of such party; (iv) the Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each party thereto and other than with respect to the Borrower, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with their respective terms; (v) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto do not and will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of such party; and (vi) no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other similar act by or in respect of, any federal or state court or governmental authority pursuant to any federal or state statute is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf of any Person on or prior to the date hereof in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents, or the performance of its obligations thereunder.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the additional limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Loan Document constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
Our opinion expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications:

This opinion is being furnished to you in connection with the transactions evidenced by the Loan Documents.

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

(h) If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and

control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize LC Exposure hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

. Funding Borrowings.
provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any
 
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
Section 2.06(a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.

The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
. Interest Elections.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing without the prior consent of the Required Lenders and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 2.07(d), the Borrower, at its sole discretion, shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to terminate in whole (but not in part), any Affected Lender's Commitment; , , that (i) the Borrower shall simultaneously prepay all outstanding Loans from such Affected Lender hereunder, together with accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable for the account of such Affected Lender hereunder, and (ii) the termination of such Affected Lender's Commitment shall not affect such Lender's rights hereunder as to matters occurring prior to such date.

upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
(d) Simultaneously with the termination of the Commitment of an Affected Lender pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph (b) of this Section:
(i) the LC Exposure of such Affected Lender shall be automatically reallocated among the other Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders) in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that each such Lender's Credit Exposure does not exceed such Lender's Commitment; and

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until
 
the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount shall have been determined, delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of such payment or liability absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to any Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date such Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its Applicable Lending Office (i) two duly executed and properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN (with respect to the benefit of an income tax treaty), or successor forms, certifying to such Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents, or (ii) if such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either (x) the forms referred to in clause (i) above certifying to such Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents, or (y) two duly executed and properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN (or successor forms) and a duly executed certificate substantially in the form of (any such certificate, a ""); that in the event that a Foreign Lender is not classified as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, such Foreign Lender shall take any actions necessary and shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent all additional (or alternative) Internal Revenue Service forms and Section 2.15(e) Certificates necessary to fully establish such Foreign Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax on all payments to be made to it under the Loan Documents (including causing its partners, members, beneficiaries or owners, or their beneficial owners, to take any actions and deliver any Internal Revenue Service forms and Section 2.15(e)

(f) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Assignment and Assumption would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.15(f), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g) Each Lender agrees that, before making a demand under this Section 2.15, it shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates if the making of such a designation or assignment will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any additional amounts that would otherwise thereafter accrue and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, require such Lender to incur a cost or expense, or legal or regulatory disadvantage, determined by such Lender to be material. Upon any such change in any Applicable Lending Office or assignment, such Lender shall provide or cause to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the appropriate form specified in Section 2.15(e).
(h) If the Borrower pays any additional amount or indemnity payment pursuant to this Section 2.15 with respect to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other recipient, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax liabilities on account of such payment; that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, shall have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax credit position, (ii) it
provided
 
believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it or (iii) no such refund or credit is available under applicable laws. In the event that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, receives such a refund or credit, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the Borrower an amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, as a result of such payment by the Borrower. Nothing contained in this Section 2.15(h) shall require the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or other recipient, as the case may be, to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any net tax benefit or its determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.15(h) to the Borrower or any other party.
(i) Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes; that, in the judgment of the Borrower, such steps shall not subject the Borrower to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Borrower.
provided

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties and
 
(ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.18(e)) among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or funded participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans or funded participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender (other than in connection with the payment of Loans or LC Disbursements of an Affected Lender in connection with the termination of the Commitment of such Lender hereunder), then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e) Subject to Section 2.18(e), if any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(b), 2.16(d) or 8.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
Section 2.17(a) If any Lender becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would entitle such Lender to receive any compensation from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13 or that would require the Borrower to make a payment to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then (unless in the case of Section 2.13 such Lender determines in its discretion not to request compensation therefor) such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.15 in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If any Lender (i) requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) requests that the Borrower make a payment to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, (iii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iv) becomes an Affected Lender, or (v) refuses to consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Document requested by the Borrower that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders and such amendment, waiver or other modification is consented to by the Required Lenders; then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.04, with the Borrower or the replacement Lender paying the processing and recording fee), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (w) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank to such assignment, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) (in the case of a Defaulting Lender, excluding, for the
provided

If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.

Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meaning.
Borrower
    
Credit Agreement
In connection with this opinion, I have examined executed copies of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and such other documents, records, agreements and certificates as I have deemed appropriate. I have also reviewed such matters of law as I have considered relevant for the purpose of this opinion.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the corporate power and authority to own its assets and to transact the business in which it is now engaged or proposes to be engaged.
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or, to the best of my knowledge, of (i) any judgment, injunction, order or decree or (ii)
 
any material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Borrower, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower.
3. To the best of my knowledge, except as set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in the Borrower's 2010 Form 10-K and other SEC filings filed by the Borrower prior to the date of this opinion, there are no pending or threatened actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination which would have a Material Adverse Effect, or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
Certain Assumptions
With your permission I have assumed the following: (a) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (b) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies and the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates I have reviewed; and (c) the absence of any evidence extrinsic to the provisions of the written agreements between the parties that the parties intended a meaning contrary to that expressed by those provisions.
Certain Limitations and Qualifications
I express no opinion as to laws other than laws of the State of California, the federal law of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. I am licensed to practice law only in the State of California.
The phrase "to the best of my knowledge" is intended to indicate that, during the course of the performance of my duties as Vice President, Legal Affairs, of the Borrower, no information that would give me current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement has come to my attention.
Use of Opinion
This opinion is solely for your benefit (and the benefit of any assignee) in connection with the transaction covered by the first paragraph of this letter and may not be relied upon, used, circulated, quoted or referred to, nor may copies hereof be delivered to, any other person without my prior written approval. I disclaim any obligation to update this opinion for events occurring or coming to my attention after the date hereof.
 
 
EXHIBIT F
[Effective Date]
To the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders party to the Credit
Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special New York counsel to Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Borrower"), in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2011 (the "Credit Agreement"), by and among the Borrower, the financial institutions from time to time parties thereto as Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"). This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(v) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.
We have examined each of the following documents:
(a) the Credit Agreement; and
(b) each of the Notes dated as of May 25, 2011, made by Borrower in favor of Lenders who requested them (collectively, the "Notes" and together with the Credit Agreement, the "Loan Documents");
We have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of rendering the opinions expressed below. We have assumed, with your permission and without independent verification of any kind: (a) that the signatures of persons signing all documents in connection with which this opinion is rendered are genuine; (b) the legal capacity of all natural persons; (c) that all documents submitted to us as originals or duplicate originals are authentic; and (d) that all documents submitted to us as copies, whether certified or not, conform to authentic original documents. As to questions of fact relevant to this opinion, we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification of any kind, the accuracy of the representations and warranties in the Loan Documents and have relied upon certificates and written statements and other written information of public officials, officers and representatives of the Borrower.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with your
permission and without any independent investigation or verification of any kind, that: (i) each party to any Loan Document has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly qualified in each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its property makes such qualification necessary; (ii) each party to any Loan Document has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform such Loan Documents to which it is a party; (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise) on the part of such party; (iv) the Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each party thereto and other than with respect to the Borrower, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with their respective terms; (v) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto do not and will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of such party; and (vi) no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other similar act by or in respect of, any federal or state court or governmental authority pursuant to any federal or state statute is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf of any Person on or prior to the date hereof in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents, or the performance of its obligations thereunder.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the additional limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Loan Document constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
Our opinion expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications:
A. Our opinion is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, moratorium, rearrangement, liquidation, conservatorship or other laws relating to or affecting creditor rights generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). These principles include, without limitation, concepts of commercial reasonableness, materiality and good faith and fair dealing. Without limiting the foregoing qualifications, the opinions expressed herein do not purport to cover, and we express no opinion with respect to, the applicability of Section 548 of the federal Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law, including the provisions relating to fraudulent conveyances.
B. Certain rights, remedies, waivers, releases or disclaimers contained in the Loan Documents may be limited or rendered unenforceable by applicable law.
 
C. Indemnities, rights of contribution, exculpatory provisions, waivers and provisions requiring arbitration of disputes may be limited by statute or public policy.
D. We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any provisions of the Loan Documents that purport to require payment or reimbursement of attorneys' fees or litigation expenses of another party.
E. We express no opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the laws of the State of New York and (ii) the federal laws of the United States of America, as currently in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we express no opinion as to (i) any federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws, (ii) any tax laws, (iii) any state or United States federal laws relating to environmental, energy regulatory, land use, health, safety, or welfare matters, (iv) any local laws or ordinances, (v) any intellectual property laws, (vi) the enforceability of the choice of law provisions in the Loan Documents except insofar as such provisions designate New York law and enforcement of the Loan Documents is sought in the courts of the State of New York, (vii) the subject matter jurisdiction of any United States District Court or (viii) the enforceability of any provision regarding the conclusive effect of any judgment or the enforcement thereof in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which rendered.
This opinion is being furnished to you in connection with the transactions evidenced by the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent and each Lender (and their permitted successors and assigns) may rely upon our opinion set forth herein in connection with those transactions. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender may rely upon our opinion set forth herein for any other purpose. Our opinion set forth herein may not be relied upon by any other person, firm, corporation, partnership or other entity without our prior written consent except that it may be disclosed (i) to your bank examiners and any other Governmental Authority or self-regulatory body to which you report or to which you are subject to review, (ii) as required by law or pursuant to legal process, and (iii) to your accountants, lawyers and other advisors so long as such accountants, lawyers and other advisors agree not to disclose, quote or file this opinion, but no such person may rely upon this opinion without our prior written consent.
The foregoing opinions are rendered as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update such opinions to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in the law which may hereafter occur.

All other required schedules are omitted because of the absence of conditions under which they are required or because the required information is given in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2010, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for fair value measurements in fiscal year 2009.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian Semiconductor," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits to customers located both in the United States, or U.S., and in international markets. We face risk factors similar to all companies in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market including, but not limited to, competition, market downturn, technological change, international operations and related foreign currency risks and the ability to recruit and retain key employees.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Varian Semiconductor and its subsidiaries and have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP.
 
Revisions
During the quarter ended October 2, 2009, we identified certain instances dating back to fiscal year 1999 in which deferred income taxes and long-term tax liabilities were not properly recorded in our financial statements. These adjustments individually and in the aggregate were not material to our financial statements for all periods impacted. We have revised our historical financial statements to properly reflect these adjustments.
We recorded adjustments to increase deferred tax assets or reduce long-term tax liabilities and decrease income tax expense, resulting in an increase of net income, or reduction in net loss, by $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended July 3, 2009 and fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts in the footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period that ends on the Friday nearest September 30. Fiscal year 2010 was comprised of a 52-week period ended on October 1, 2010. Fiscal year 2009 was comprised of a 52-week period ended on October 2, 2009. Fiscal year 2008 was comprised of a 53-week period ended on October 3, 2008.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, deferred revenue, loss contingencies, warranty accruals, the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, and allowance for doubtful accounts. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
 
 
Revenue Recognition
Product revenue is comprised of established and new products including tools, upgrades and spare parts.
We recognize revenue from tool sales upon shipment, provided that title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are contractually fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements.
We generally follow predetermined criteria for changing the classification of a new tool to an established tool. We generally recognize tools as established after demonstrating success in achieving customer acceptance of the same tool type and specification, for the same or similar application. In most circumstances, once a new tool achieves the predetermined criteria, the tool is considered established. Furthermore, prior installation costs on the tool type can also influence the evaluation of tool maturity on a going forward basis.
Tools are classified as established if the installation process and the post-delivery acceptance provisions are deemed routine, and there is a demonstrated history of achieving the predetermined established tool criteria. The majority of tools are designed and manufactured to meet contractual customer specifications, and established tools must have been demonstrated to meet customer specifications before shipment.
For established and new tools, a portion of the total purchase price is typically not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the tool. For established tools, the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount due upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery. The amount deferred for installation is recognized as service revenue upon customer acceptance and any remaining deferral is recognized as product revenue. For new tools, revenue is not recognized until customer acceptance. Spare parts and upgrade sales are typically recognized as revenue upon the later of delivery or the transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer.
Service revenue includes revenue from maintenance and service contracts, extended warranties, paid service and system installation services. Revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts. Extended warranty revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable warranty term. Revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation and customer acceptance. It generally takes approximately three to six weeks for our technicians to complete the installation of our products and perform tests agreed to with customers. Certain customers formally document their acceptance of our products at this time. Other customers elect to perform additional internal testing prior to formal acceptance, and this process generally takes eight to twelve weeks.
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. In accordance with the new guidance, we applied the adoption prospectively from the beginning of fiscal year 2010. There was no significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon implementation and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future reporting periods based on our current practices. The new accounting guidance impacts the determination of when the individual elements included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified elements by requiring the use of the relative selling price method and no longer permitting the use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration. Additionally, the new accounting guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of estimated selling prices, or ESP,
 
 
of elements if the entity does not have vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or third-party evidence, or TPE, of a selling price. A selling price hierarchy must be followed in which an entity must first determine that it does not have VSOE or TPE before using ESP to allocate revenue to the elements in an arrangement.
For transactions that originated through October 2, 2009 and were not materially modified after that date, revenue was allocated to systems on a residual method basis. Under this method, the total value of the arrangement was allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their fair values, with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue. For transactions that originated or were materially modified after October 2, 2009, we use the relative selling price method. The total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on relative selling price as determined using the selling price hierarchy. We regularly review the method used to determine our relative selling price and update any estimates accordingly.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. The new accounting guidance amends the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted in the same period as the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, we adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue includes customer advances and amounts that have been billed pursuant to contractual terms but have not been recognized as revenue. We also defer the fair value of extended warranties bundled with equipment sales as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue for extended warranties is recognized ratably over the applicable warranty term, which generally is from 13 to 24 months from the date the customer accepts the products.
Evaluation Tools
We periodically supply evaluation tools to potential new customers, usually for a period of six months to one year. While the tool is at the customer's semiconductor manufacturing factory, or fab, we work closely with the customer on complex processes to qualify the tool for that particular customer's requirements. Until it is determined that a sale is probable, qualification costs are included in marketing, general and administrative expenses in the period incurred and we amortize the carrying value of the evaluation tool ratably over a period of typically four years. These costs are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expenses and the carrying value of the evaluation tool is included in inventory. Once it is determined a sale is probable, future qualification costs are added to the carrying value of the tool and the amortization of the carrying value is terminated. Customer evaluations are often successful and upon fulfillment of all four revenue recognition criteria, we recognize the revenue from the evaluation tool and remaining tool costs through revenue and cost of product revenue, respectively.
Stock-based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock-based awards exchanged for employee and director services is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
 
 
The choice of a valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique, involve significant judgments. These judgments reflect management's assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. Our judgments could change over time if the facts underlying these assumptions change, or as additional information becomes available. Any change in judgments could have a material impact on our financial statements. We believe that these estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non-traded stock options.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.
Short-term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All short-term investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value, which approximates cost, due to the short period of time to maturity and the relative risk of the investments. At fiscal year end 2010, we had the ability but not the intent to liquidate certain investments in order to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition have been classified as long-term.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Substantially all of our accounts receivable balance relates to trade receivables. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products and services. Accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded. The remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the amount of days the balance is past due and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
Inventory and Purchase Order Commitments
We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. On a quarterly basis, we assess the realizability of all inventories to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required. The determination of lower of cost or market requires that we make significant assumptions about future demand for products and the transition to new product offerings from legacy products. We also provide for losses on those open purchase order commitments in which our estimated obligation to receive inventory under the commitments exceeds expected production demand. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, supplier lead time and technological and market obsolescence. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis has been established, it is not written back up if demand increases.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed in the period the cost is incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated
 
 
useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is less. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are relieved from the accounts and resulting gains or losses are included in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets
As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, goodwill was $12.3 million. In accordance with the provisions of the goodwill accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized. We test for the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test for goodwill impairment at the consolidated level, as our subsidiaries do not constitute separate businesses and all possess similar economic characteristics. The test is performed by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities from the total estimated fair value to determine residual goodwill. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in each of the fiscal years ended 2010 and 2009 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, we review these assets for impairment. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of that asset, impairment exists. We recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is normally assessed using a discounted cash flow model. No impairment losses on long-lived assets were recognized in each of the fiscal years ended 2010 and 2009.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or supplier warranties on parts differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Environmental Liabilities
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. In situations where the various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate then future costs, the lower limit of an estimated range is accrued on a non-discounted basis. All other liabilities, where we have generally sufficient knowledge to estimate the scope of costs and future activities, are accrued on a discounted basis. Should new information become available and/or different assumptions are applied in the estimation of environmental liabilities, revisions to the accrued environmental liability would be required.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred
 
 
tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which the determination is made.
The accounting standard which provides guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The accounting standard for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets. As a result, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against currency exposures that are associated with certain of our assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies. The effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. We believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
All of our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Foreign Currency Translation
For international operations, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Nonmonetary assets such as inventories and property, plant, and equipment are translated at historical rates. Income and expense items are translated at effective rates of exchange prevailing during each year, except that inventories and depreciation charged to operations are translated at historical rates. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other expense, net.
 
 
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable, cash investments and forward foreign exchange contracts. In recent fiscal years, we have sold over half of our systems to our ten largest customers, and our trade accounts receivable is primarily comprised of these respective customers. However, the concentration of credit risk is limited as the customer base is dispersed among many geographic regions and is comprised primarily of large multinational companies. Furthermore, for some higher risk customers, we may require a letter of credit to reduce credit exposure. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral from our customers. As of October 1, 2010, four customers accounted for 12%, 11%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of the accounts receivable balance. As of October 2, 2009, two customers accounted for 23% and 21% of the accounts receivable balance.
In fiscal year 2010, revenue from two customers accounted for 23% and 13% of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2009, revenue from two customers accounted for 21% and 16% of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2008, revenue from two customers accounted for 16% and 13% of our total revenue.
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009 were $150.3 million and $164.5 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are invested with multiple financial institutions. Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury, government agency and corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value due to the short period of time to maturity and the relative risk of the investments. We manage our cash equivalents and investments as a single portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements. We also place forward foreign exchange contracts with investment grade financial institutions in order to minimize currency risk exposure.
We obtain some of the components and subassemblies that are included in our products from a limited group of suppliers, or in some cases a single source supplier. The loss of any supplier, including any single source supplier, would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers and may also require devoting significant resources to product development to incorporate new parts from other sources into our products. The need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause delays in delivery or significantly increase our costs. Although we have insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources, we cannot provide assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that it will remain available on commercially acceptable terms. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers, disruption or loss of these sources could negatively impact our business and damage customer relationships.
Research, Development and Engineering Costs
Research, development and engineering is comprised mainly of costs of internally-funded projects as well as continuing product development support. Costs incurred generally consist of employee and material costs, depreciation of equipment and other engineering related expenses. Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance states that the reporting entity should disclose separately
 
 
information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. We do not expect this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Fair Value
In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. The framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for the delay of the effective date for one year of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities on October 4, 2008, but elected a partial deferral under the provision related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when it was applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements when it was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The accounting standard for fair value measurements specifies a hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels are defined as follows:
 
 
 
This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. We maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. Further, we used internal sources and considered external sources to assist us in valuing certain instruments.
 
 
Determination of Fair Value
We measure fair value utilizing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The following is a description of valuation methodologies we used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy.
Cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents such as Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities of those financial assets.
Securities available-for-sale
Equity securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy, where quoted prices are available in an active market. We may utilize an alternative pricing method (for example, matrix pricing) and quotations from bond dealers to assist in determining fair value for each security traded over-the-counter rather than on a securities exchange. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions or by reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, to determine fair value. Securities priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2 and typically include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds.
Deferred compensation
The deferred compensation liability represents our obligation to pay benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The related investments, held in a Rabbi Trust, consist of equity securities, primarily mutual funds, and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Realized gains (losses) to fair value of both the equity securities and the related deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in marketing, general and administrative expense.
Derivatives
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in an active market for derivative assets and liabilities, which are traded on exchanges. These derivative assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
 
 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
 
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, the portfolio of financial assets excludes $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of minority equity investments in four and two private companies, respectively, which are accounted for under the cost method and are outside the scope of the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements. These equity investments are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
Note 4. Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
 
 
The estimated fair value of our stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards' vesting period. The effect of recording stock-based compensation for fiscal years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:
 
We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. Our expected term is calculated using historical data and assumes that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vest date and the full contractual term and is further adjusted for demographic data. We interpolate the risk-free interest rate from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond that coincides with the expected term. We do not have a history of paying dividends, nor do we expect to in the future. In fiscal year 2009, we determined that a blended volatility, using exclusively our historical and implied volatility measures, best reflects expected volatility over the expected term of the option. Prior to fiscal year 2009, we relied on a blended volatility, using our historical and implied volatility measures, and a peer group implied volatility. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
The fair value of each option granted during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
Stock Incentive Plan
The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, or the Plan, which replaced the Amended and Restated Omnibus Stock Plan upon shareholder approval on February 9, 2006, provides for the grant of non-qualified share-based awards to our eligible employees, consultants and non-employee directors. As of October 1, 2010, a total of 4,436,484 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Plan.
 
 
Stock option awards granted under the Plan generally have a life no longer than eight years after the date of the grant and generally vest as to 25% one year from date of grant with the remaining 75% vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments so that all options are vested at the end of four years. We normally settle employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. Restricted stock awards are granted under the Plan at $0.01 per share and generally vest as to 25% one year from the date of grant with the remaining 75% vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments.
Stock compensation expense associated with restricted common stock and restricted stock units is charged for the difference between the market value on the date of grant and the issuance price, less estimated forfeitures, and is amortized over the awards' vesting period on a straight-line basis for all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method applies to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
The following table summarizes the stock option and restricted stock activity for fiscal year 2010:
 
The total intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $28.90 as of the last day of fiscal year 2010 and represents the amounts that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.
As of October 1, 2010, the unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $15.8 million and $19.7 million, respectively. These amounts will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years and 2.9 years, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $12.7 million, $4.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, with intrinsic value defined as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date strike price. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these options in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16.3 million, $6.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $3.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11.8 million, $9.4 million and $16.9 million, respectively.
 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our employees, who elect to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, are able to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts six months. On November 24, 2008, we decided to suspend enrollment and participation in the ESPP from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, there were a total of 828,266 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under the ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
Note 5.    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009 were $150.3 million and $164.5 million, respectively.
Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The cost of securities sold was determined based on the specific identification method. Investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition have been classified as long-term.
Net realized losses on investments for fiscal year 2010 were approximately $0.1 million. Net realized losses on investments for fiscal year 2009 were approximately $0.5 million. Net realized gains on investments for fiscal year 2008 were approximately $0.4 million. As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, net unrealized gains on investments of $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were recorded as other comprehensive income.
We determined that the unrealized losses at as of October 1, 2010, as aggregated by security type in the table below, are temporary. This assessment is based upon the nature of the investments and the causes of the unrealized losses. The investments are in corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as stated in the investment policy. The unrealized losses relate to the decline in fair value due to differences between the securities' interest rates at acquisition and current interest rates and the decline in credit worthiness of certain debtors.
 
 
Unrealized losses on investments as of October 1, 2010 by investment category and length of time the investment has been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 1, 2010 were as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 2, 2009 were as follows:
 
The investment maturities are as follows:
 
 
 
Note 6. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of the following:
 
Note 7.    Inventories
The components of inventories are as follows:
 
Note 8.    Property, Plant and Equipment
The components of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:
 
Depreciation expense was $15.9 million, $15.6 million and $17.1 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no capital leases in fiscal years 2010 or 2009.
Note 9.    Notes Payable
On May 23, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with multiple financial institutions providing for borrowings of a maximum principal amount of up to $100.0 million under an unsecured revolving credit facility. Amounts could be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time during the five year commitment period ending May 23, 2013. Borrowings would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either: (1) the greater of (a) the prime rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; or (2) the sum of (a) LIBOR, with certain adjustments and (b) an "applicable rate," defined in the credit agreement as a percentage spread based on our
 
 
leverage ratio. The credit agreement contained events of default and covenants. The credit facility was intended to provide ongoing working capital and cash for acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We terminated this credit agreement effective March 27, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement.
Our subsidiary in Japan had one credit facility during fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Maximum available borrowing under the facility was Yen 400,000,000 ($4.8 million) at fiscal year end 2010. The loan is not collateralized and contains no restrictive covenants, although the loan is guaranteed by us. The interest rate for the facility is the 3-month Tokyo interbank offered rate (TIBOR) plus 1.00%, which was approximately 1.4% and 1.6% as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings as of October 1, 2010 and as of October 2, 2009 under this facility. Our subsidiary in Japan also had an additional credit facility during fiscal year 2009, which was terminated in that year.
Our subsidiary in Taiwan terminated their credit facility of $1.0 million during fiscal year 2009. Any outstanding U.S. Dollar borrowings under the Taiwan facility accrued interest at the local base rate plus 2.0% plus taxes.
Our subsidiary in Europe maintains a credit facility that includes overdraft protection of Euro 2.5 million which at October 1, 2010 translated to $3.4 million. Interest accrues at the Euro base rate plus 1.5% and was approximately 6.1% and 6.4% at October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. Borrowings under this facility are payable on demand. The credit facility is not collateralized nor does it contain any restrictive covenants, although the facility is guaranteed by us. There were no outstanding borrowings as of October 1, 2010 and as of October 2, 2009 under this facility.
Note 10.    Accrued Expenses
The components of accrued expenses are as follows:
 
Note 11.    Restructuring
The semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic downturns and we have historically recorded restructuring charges in connection with cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the industry downturns. Restructuring charges typically consist of severance, benefits and outplacement services offered to terminated employees and sometimes include charges for remaining lease payments on facilities that are closed. Prior to any restructuring announcements, the restructuring is approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the reduction in force.
We began relocating our European operations in Houten, the Netherlands to Schaffhausen, Switzerland, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. The restructuring charge is comprised primarily of one-time termination benefits,
 
 
and contract termination expense related to a facility lease. European restructuring activity is significantly complete. The recognized cost of the European restructuring activity from the date of its commencement to October 1, 2010 is $2.5 million.
Exclusive of cash outlays of $0.7 million related to severance and contract termination costs to exit the Houten facility, there was no significant restructuring activity during fiscal year 2010. Cash outlays related to contract termination costs to exit the Houten facility will continue through fiscal year 2014.
The following table summarizes the restructuring activity for fiscal years 2009 and 2008.
 
Note 12.    Product Warranties
We warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and will conform to our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery for a period of three to twelve months from the date the customer accepts the products. Additionally, we warrant that maintenance services will be performed in a workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for a period of 90 days from the completion of any agreed-upon services. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. Our warranty obligation is affected by a number of factors, including product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should these factors or other factors affecting warranty costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Product warranty activity for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was as follows:
 
 
 
The components of product warranty liability are as follows:
 
Note 13.    Deferred Revenue
The components of deferred revenue are as follows:
 
Note 14.    Long-term Accrued Expenses and Other Long-term Liabilities
There were $80.2 million and $66.3 million in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. Included in these amounts were $55.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, for long-term tax liabilities. In addition, post-employment liabilities, environmental and other costs not expected to be expended within the next year were included in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The current portion was recorded within accrued expenses.
Note 15.    Long-term Debt
In February 2003, we purchased our previously leased facility located in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The purchase price consisted of cash payments totaling $3.4 million, the assumption of the seller's outstanding loan of $5.1 million and the transfer of other prepaid assets of $0.8 million. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 9.05% with monthly payments of principal and interest until the loan matures in January 2013. The $1.6 million carrying amount of the loan had an estimated fair value of $1.7 million as of October 1, 2010. The fair value of the loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The interest rate was estimated based on current market conditions and our financial condition as of October 1, 2010.
 
 
The loan payments are as follows:
 
Note 16.    Derivative Financial Instruments
Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exposure that is associated with certain of our revenues, assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies.
We hedge our exposure in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts. Since these derivatives hedge existing exposures that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on non-U.S. dollar forecasted revenue transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. We do not engage in currency speculation. For purposes of presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows, derivative gains and losses are presented within net cash provided by operating activities.
Cash flow hedges
A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures on forecasted non-U.S dollar denominated sales transactions. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. These derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the gain or loss from the derivative is reclassified from other comprehensive (loss) income to the consolidated statements of operations, in the related revenue caption, as appropriate. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized immediately in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-designated hedges
Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these outstanding non-designated derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
 
The following table provides the types of derivative instruments outstanding as of October 1, 2010 (amounts in thousands):
 
The following table provides the types of derivative instruments outstanding as of October 2, 2009 (amounts in thousands):

The following table provides the effect derivative instruments had on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year end 2009 (amounts in thousands):
 
Forward Exchange Contracts
As a multinational company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as our business practices evolve and could impact our financial results. We use derivative instruments to protect our foreign operations from fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. We hedge our current exposures and a portion of our anticipated foreign currency exposures with foreign currency forward contracts having terms of up to twelve months.
We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in the exchange rates. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Historically, our primary exposures have resulted from non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and purchases in Asia Pacific and Europe. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We hedge currency exposures that are associated with certain of our assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies. Net foreign exchange losses for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Our international sales, except for those in Japan, are primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar. For foreign currency-denominated sales, however, the volatility of the foreign currency markets represents risk to us. Upon forecasting the exposure, we enter into hedges with forward sales contracts whose critical terms are designed to match those of the underlying exposure. These hedges are evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly using the change in value of the forward contracts to the change in value of the underlying transaction, with the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in other comprehensive income. Any measured ineffectiveness is included immediately in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There was an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness recognized during fiscal years 2010 and 2009.
 
 
The table below presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates), the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and the estimated fair value of our contracts outstanding as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009.
 
Note 17.    Income Taxes
The provisions for income taxes are as follows:
 
 
 
Total pre-tax income (loss) consists of the following:
 
The effective tax rate on pre-tax income differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the following:
 
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately $155 million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2010. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
 
 
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Deferred tax assets include gross state tax credit carryforwards of $20.5 million, $19.5 million and $17.0 million at fiscal year end 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These credits begin to expire in fiscal year 2018. Net operating losses included in deferred tax assets begin to expire in 2014.
We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate both the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income, ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the ability to utilize tax losses and credits in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance related to certain state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards has been recorded. Although, due to the global reorganization, we have increased our utilization of state tax credits, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of these credits will not be utilized, since historically the annual amount of state credits generated exceeds the amount of credits that can be used. We record a benefit to the tax provision and corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance related to the utilization of state tax credits generated in prior years. Should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our other deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be required resulting in an expense recorded within the provision for income taxes in the statement of income in the period in which such determination was made. It is possible that the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the near term, if our forecast of future taxable income is reduced. Our effective tax rate is affected by levels of taxable income in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions, U.S. tax credits generated and utilized for research and development expenditures, U.S. foreign income exclusion, investment tax credits and other tax incentives specific to domestic and foreign operations.
We benefit from tax incentives on approved investments in Singapore and Switzerland. The Singapore tax incentive expired on September 30, 2010. The Switzerland tax incentives are for periods ranging from five to ten years and are scheduled to expire within three to seven years. As a result of the tax holidays, our net income was higher by $14.6 million ($0.20 per share), lower by $0.9 million ($0.01 per share) and higher by $2.4 million
 
 
($0.03 per share) for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The benefit of losses incurred in Switzerland in fiscal year 2009 at a reduced rate resulted in an overall negative impact of the tax holidays to the consolidated financial statements in that year. We do not expect the expiration of the Singapore incentive to have a material effect on the tax rate in the future.
In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, tax deductions associated with certain exercises of stock options, activity related to our ESPP and vesting of certain restricted stock shares resulted in a tax benefit recorded to capital in excess of par value of $3.3 million, $0.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. We have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, extraterritorial income deduction and qualified production deduction through the statement of operations rather than through paid-in-capital.
The aggregate changes in the balances of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
 
The net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal year 2010 was $7.6 million for positions taken in the current year. Of the $62.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $60.9 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective rate consists of items that are offset by deferred tax assets, relating to state tax credits which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, we accrued $5.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The statute of limitations for our tax filings with federal, state and foreign tax authorities is generally open for fiscal years 2003 through the present. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, commenced an examination of fiscal year 2007 in December of 2008. The IRS completed examinations of certain refund claims filed for fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and we filed a protest of the refund claim audit findings with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The IRS audit of fiscal year 2007 is continuing and has been extended to include fiscal year 2009. It is unknown whether agreement on the refund claims or resolution of the IRS audit of fiscal years 2007 and 2009 will be reached within the next twelve months. The favorable resolution of the claims filed with the Appeals Office could result in a benefit to the tax provision of up to $5.8 million, excluding interest. Based on the status of the IRS audit, it is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of any changes to our previously recorded uncertain tax positions. It is possible that up to $26.8 million of unrecognized tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, may be recognized within one year as the result of the lapse of statutes of limitations.
 
 
Note 18.    Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and participating unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes additional dilution from stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and non-participating unvested restricted stock. Options to purchase common shares with exercise prices that exceeded the market value of the underlying common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For purposes of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation, the additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options are determined using the treasury stock method, which includes share-based compensation expense as assumed proceeds and the tax effect of such compensation.
The calculation of assumed proceeds, used to determine diluted weighted average shares outstanding under the treasury stock method is adjusted by tax windfalls and shortfalls associated with outstanding stock awards. Windfalls and shortfalls are computed by comparing the tax deductible amount of outstanding stock awards to their grant date fair values and multiplying the result by the applicable statutory tax rate. A positive result creates a windfall, which increases the assumed proceeds and a negative result creates a shortfall, which reduces the assumed proceeds.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and, therefore, should be included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participating rights in undistributed earnings. Our restricted stock awards granted to employees are considered participating securities as they receive rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stockholders and thus are included in computing our earnings per share. The effect of this adoption impacted both previously reported basic and diluted net loss per share by $0.01 for fiscal year 2009, and basic and diluted net income per share by $(0.02) and $(0.01), respectively, for fiscal year 2008.
A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the net income (loss) per share calculations is presented as follows:
 
 
 
Stock options to purchase the following number of shares of common stock were not included in our calculations of diluted earnings per share, as the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive:
 
Note 19.    Share Repurchase Plan
In October 2004, our board of directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to $100.0 million of our common stock on the open market. Subsequently, our board of directors voted to increase to the amount of funds that may be expended in repurchasing our common stock to a total of $800.0 million. The program does not have a fixed expiration date. As of fiscal year end 2010, approximately $67.7 million remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization.
We repurchased the following shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan:
 
We repurchased an additional 421,385 shares for a total cost of $12.8 million between October 2, 2010 and November 15, 2010, the latest practicable date prior to the filing date of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Note 20.    Retirement Plans
We have a defined contribution retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Generally, we make a guaranteed contribution, and in some years a discretionary contribution, to each participant's account, typically based on fiscal year earnings achievement and calculated as a percentage of the participant's base pay. Participants are entitled, upon termination or retirement, to their portion of the retirement fund assets, which are held by a third-party custodian. Through fiscal year 2010, we had two subsidiary-sponsored defined benefit pension plans. In late fiscal year 2010, one of these plans was terminated and replaced by a defined contribution plan. The obligation related to this plan was settled by either cash payments to employees or transfers of assets to third party investment accounts as designated by the employee.
In connection with the spin-off from Varian Associates, Inc, we have defined benefit retirement plan liabilities. This plan is administered by Varian Medical Systems, Inc, or VMS. We reimburse VMS for shared costs related to this plan.
Our liabilities related to pension and other post-retirement benefits were $7.4 million and $8.6 million as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively. In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, our retirement benefit expense was $5.2 million, $2.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Our defined contribution retirement plan operates on a calendar year basis. Corporate contributions were suspended from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 due to cost reduction efforts in response to the industry downturn.
 
 
Note 21.    Lease Commitments
We lease various types of warehouse and office facilities and equipment, furniture and fixtures under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:
 
Rental expense was $2.9 million in fiscal year 2010. In both fiscal years 2009 and 2008 rental expense was $3.1 million, respectively.
Note 22.    Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity at our request. The term of the indemnification period is upon the later of (i) ten years after the person has ceased being an officer or director, or (ii) the termination of all pending or threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We enter into indemnification agreements in the normal course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our customers, in connection with any patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products. We generally seek to limit liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products subject to the indemnification obligations. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited. Based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We also indemnify certain customers with respect to damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental claims related to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, officers, authorized agents or subcontractors. We have general and umbrella insurance policies that limit our exposure under these indemnification obligations and guarantees. As a result of our insurance policy coverage and based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
 
 
Prior to the spin-off of Varian Semiconductor from Varian Associates, Inc., or VAI, Varian Semiconductor's business was operated as the Semiconductor Equipment Business, or SEB, of VAI. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, its Instruments Business to Varian, Inc., or VI, and changed its name to Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or VMS. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. In connection with the spin-off from VAI, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI entered into certain agreements which include a Distribution Agreement, an Employee Benefits Allocation Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, and a Transition Services Agreement, (collectively, the Distribution Related Agreements) whereby Varian Semiconductor agreed to indemnify VMS and VI for any costs, liabilities or expenses relating to Varian Semiconductor's legal proceedings. Under the Distribution Related Agreements, Varian Semiconductor has agreed to reimburse VMS for one-third of the costs, liabilities, and expenses, adjusted for any related tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS, with respect to certain legal proceedings relating to discontinued operations of VMS. We believe, difference between the estimated fair value of the indemnification agreements and the amounts recorded in our financial statements, is minimal.
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and/or local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These include laws regarding discharges into soil, water and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. In addition, several countries are reviewing proposed regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose of their products at the end of a product's useful life. These laws have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of certain operations.
We also enter into purchase order commitments in the normal course of business. As of fiscal year end 2010, we had $85.1 million of purchase order commitments with various suppliers. In addition, we maintain vendor liability agreements whereby product can be delivered within our lead time requirements. As of October 1, 2010, our maximum liability under these arrangements was approximately $30.0 million.
Environmental Remediation
VAI has been named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, at eight sites where VAI is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal. VAI is also involved in various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in consultation with, foreign, federal, state and/or local agencies at certain current or former VAI facilities (including facilities disposed of in connection with VAI's sale of its Electron Devices business during fiscal year 1995, and the sale of its Thin Film Systems business during fiscal year 1997). The Distribution Related Agreements provide that each of VMS, Varian Semiconductor and VI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of May 2010, will indemnify the others for one-third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs, as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs.
For certain of these sites and facilities, various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken. Per the estimates provided by VMS, we have accrued $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009. As to other sites and facilities, sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to reasonably estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities. As such, we have accrued $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, which represents future costs discounted at 7%, net of inflation, to cover our portion of these costs. This reserve is in addition to the $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, as previously described.
 
 
As of fiscal year end 2010, our environmental liability, based upon future environmental-related costs estimated by VMS as of that date and included in current and long-term accrued expenses, is calculated as follows:
 
As of fiscal year end 2010, the current portion of the reserve is $0.7 million and the long-term portion of the reserve is $4.0 million, which is included in long-term accrued expenses. The difference of $0.2 million between the total anticipated future costs and the amounts recognized on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end 2010 is attributable to the pay down of the obligation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
The amounts set forth in the foregoing table are only estimates of anticipated future environmental-related costs and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates. The aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation and remediation activities and the large number of sites where VMS is undertaking such investigation and remediation activities. VMS believes that most of these cost ranges will narrow as investigation and remediation activities progress. We believe our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of the obligations become more clearly defined, these reserves may be modified and related charges against income may be made.
Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available to management and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, our management believes that the costs of these environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our liability for environmental-related investigation and remediation in light of the liability and financial wherewithal of potentially responsible parties and insurance companies where we believe that we have rights to contribution, indemnity and/or reimbursement. Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already incurred, and to be incurred in the future, have been asserted against various insurance companies and other third parties. In 1992, VAI filed a lawsuit against 36 insurance companies with respect to most of the above-referenced sites and facilities. VAI received certain cash settlements with respect to these lawsuits in prior years. VMS has also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures. Although VMS intends to aggressively pursue additional insurance recoveries, we have not reduced any liability in anticipation of recovery with respect to claims made against third parties.
 
 
Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to legal disputes. While we believe we have meritorious claims and/or defenses with respect to each dispute, the outcomes are not determinable. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these disputes, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.
Note 23.    Other Transactions with Affiliates
Operations prior to April 2, 1999 had been part of the former VAI, which now operates as VMS. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, then distributed to the holders of record of VAI common stock one share of common stock of Varian Semiconductor for each share of VAI common stock owned on March 24, 1999. At the same time, VAI contributed its Instruments Business, or IB, to VI and distributed to the holders of record of VAI common stock one share of common stock of IB for each share of VAI common stock owned on March 24, 1999. VAI retained its Health Care Systems business and changed its name to VMS effective as of April 2, 1999. These transactions were accomplished under the terms of a Distribution Agreement by and among Varian Semiconductor, VAI, hereafter referred to as VMS for periods following the spin-off and VI, or the Distribution Agreement. For purposes of providing an orderly transition and to define certain ongoing relationships between and among Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI after the spin-off, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI also entered into the Distribution Related Agreements. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc.
The Distribution Related Agreements provide that from and after the spin-off, VMS, VI and Varian Semiconductor will indemnify each and their respective subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents against all losses arising in connection with shared liabilities (including certain environmental and legal liabilities). All shared liabilities will be managed and administered by VMS and expenses and losses, net of proceeds and other receivables, will be borne one-third each by VMS, VI, and Varian Semiconductor. The Distribution Related Agreements also provide that we shall assume all of our liabilities, other than shared liabilities (including accounts payable, accrued payroll and pension liabilities) in accordance with their terms. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we were charged $1.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, by VMS in settlement of these obligations.
Note 24.    Operating Segments and Geographic Information
We have determined that we operate in one business segment: the manufacturing, marketing and servicing of semiconductor processing equipment for ion implantation systems. Since we operate in one segment, all financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue from our ten largest customers in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 accounted for approximately 80%, 73% and 74% of total revenue, respectively. In fiscal year 2010, revenue from tsmc and Samsung accounted for 23% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2009, revenue from Intel and tsmc accounted for 21% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2008, revenue from Samsung and Intel accounted for 16% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue.
Sales to Asia Pacific accounted for 78%, 63% and 70% of revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our North American sales accounted for 15%, 28% and 22% of total revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. European sales accounted for 8%, 9% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively.
 
 
The following table summarizes revenue for the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 based on final destination and long-lived assets as of fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 by geography:

Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of Business
Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian Semiconductor," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits to customers located both in the United States, or U.S., and in international markets.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010 filed with the SEC on November 22, 2010. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the information required to be set forth therein. The results of operations for the three and six months ended April 1, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year or for any other period.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Recently Adopted Changes in Accounting Principles
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This guidance also requires a gross presentation of activity related to Level 3 fair value measurements, presenting separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. This guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 fair value measurements, which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting periods within those years. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 except for the guidance related to the gross presentation of Level 3 fair value measurements, which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The new accounting guidance impacts the determination of when the individual elements included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified elements by requiring the use of the relative selling price method and no longer permitting the use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration. Additionally, the new accounting guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of estimated selling prices, or ESP, of elements if the entity does not have vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or third-party evidence, or TPE, of a selling price. A selling price hierarchy must be followed in which an entity must first determine that it does not have VSOE or TPE before using ESP to allocate revenue to the elements in an arrangement. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. In accordance with the new guidance, we applied the adoption prospectively from the beginning of fiscal year 2010. There was no significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon implementation and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future reporting periods based on our current practices.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. The new accounting guidance amends the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. The new accounting
 
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted in the same period as the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, we adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for the delay of the effective date for one year of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities on October 4, 2008, but elected a partial deferral under the provision related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. We adopted the guidance related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 2. Fair Value
Fair Value Hierarchy
The accounting standards codification for fair value measurements specifies a hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels are defined as follows:
 
 
 
This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. We maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. Further, we used internal sources and considered external sources to assist us in valuing certain instruments.
Determination of Fair Value
We measure fair value utilizing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The following is a description of valuation methodologies we used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy.
Cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents such as Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities of those financial assets.
Securities available-for-sale
Equity securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy, where quoted prices are available in an active market. We may utilize an alternative pricing method (for example, matrix pricing) and quotations from bond dealers to assist in determining fair value for each security traded over-the-counter rather than on a securities exchange. Matrix pricing is a
 
mathematical technique which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions or by reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, to determine fair value. Securities priced using such methods are classified as Level 2 and include U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds.
Deferred compensation
The deferred compensation liability represents our obligation to pay benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The related investments, held in a Rabbi Trust, consist of equity securities, primarily mutual funds, and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Realized gains and losses to fair value of both the equity securities and the related deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in marketing, general and administrative expense.
Derivatives
We use quoted prices in an active market for derivative assets and liabilities, which are traded on exchanges. These derivative assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
 
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
As of both April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, the portfolio of financial assets excludes $1.7 million of investment in equity in four private companies. These investments are accounted for under the cost method and are outside the scope of the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements. These equity investments are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
Note 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010 were $239.4 million and $150.3 million, respectively.
Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The cost of securities sold was determined based on the specific identification method. Investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the respective balance sheet date are classified as long-term.
Net realized gains on investments for the three and six months ended April 1, 2011 were $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Net realized losses for both the three and six months ended April 2, 2010 were $0.1 million. As of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, net unrealized gains on investments of $1.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, were recorded as other comprehensive income.
We determined that the unrealized losses as of April 1, 2011, as aggregated by security type in the table below, are temporary. This assessment is based upon the nature of the investments and the causes of the unrealized losses. The investments are in corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and municipal bonds as stated in the investment policy. The unrealized losses relate to the decline in fair value due to differences between the securities' interest rates at acquisition and current interest rates and the decline in credit worthiness of certain debtors.
Unrealized losses on investments as of April 1, 2011 by investment category and length of time the investment has been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of April 1, 2011 were as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 1, 2010 were as follows:
 
The investment maturities are as follows:
 
Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
The estimated fair value of our stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the vesting period of the respective award. The effect of recording stock-based compensation for the three and six months ended April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010 are as follows:
 
We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. Our expected term is calculated using historical data and assumes that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vest date and the full contractual term and is further adjusted for demographic data. We interpolate the risk-free interest rate from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond that coincides with the expected term. We do not have a history of paying dividends, nor do we expect to in the future. We use a blended volatility, using our historical and implied volatility measures. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
The following table summarizes stock option and restricted stock activity as of and for the six months ended April 1, of fiscal year 2011:
 
As of April 1, 2011, there were a total of 3,064,798 shares reserved for issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The aggregate intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $48.11 on April 1, 2011, and represents the amounts that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. Intrinsic value is defined as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date price.
 
As of April 1, 2011, the unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $11.8 million and $38.2 million, respectively. These amounts will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years and 3.2 years, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2011, was $29.0 million and $37.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six month periods ended April 2, 2010, was $1.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively.
The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2011, was $4.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and six month periods ended April 2, 2010, was $3.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our employees who elect to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, are able to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period. Each offering period lasts six months. On November 24, 2008, we decided to suspend enrollment and participation in the ESPP as of January 1, 2009 due to efforts to reduce equity compensation expense. We lifted the suspension on January 1, 2011. During the six months ended April 1, 2011, there were no shares purchased under the ESPP. As of April 1, 2011, there were a total of 828,266 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under the ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
Note 5. Computation of Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and participating unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share includes additional dilution from stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and non-participating unvested restricted stock. Options to purchase common shares with exercise prices that exceeded the market value of the underlying common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For purposes of the diluted net income per share calculation, the additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options are determined using the treasury stock method, which includes as assumed proceeds, share-based compensation expense and the tax effect of such compensation.
The calculation of assumed proceeds, used to determine diluted weighted average shares outstanding under the treasury stock method is adjusted by tax windfalls and shortfalls associated with outstanding stock awards. Windfalls and shortfalls are computed by comparing the tax deductible amount of outstanding stock awards to their grant date fair values and multiplying the result by the applicable statutory tax rate. A positive result creates a windfall, which increases the assumed proceeds and a negative result creates a shortfall, which reduces the assumed proceeds.
A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the net income per share calculations is presented as follows:
 
For the three and six months ended April 1, 2011, 0.2 million and 0.9 million potentially dilutive shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and six months ended April 2, 2010, 1.9 million and 1.8 million potentially dilutive shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
Note 6. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of the following:
 
Note 7. Inventories
The components of inventories are as follows:
 
Note 8. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
The components of accrued expenses and other current liabilities are as follows:
 
Note 9. Long-Term Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities
There were $91.1 million and $81.1 million in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities at April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, respectively. Included in these amounts were $62.4 million and $55.2 million, respectively, for long-term tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions (see Note 16. Income Taxes). In addition, product warranty liabilities, post-employment liabilities, environmental and other costs which are not expected to be expended within the next year are included in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The current portion is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Note 10. Product Warranties
We warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and will conform to our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery for a period of three to twelve months from the date the customer accepts the products. Additionally, we warrant that maintenance services will be performed in a workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for a period of 90 days from the completion of any agreed-upon services. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. Our warranty obligation is affected by a number of factors, including product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should these factors or other factors affecting warranty costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Product warranty activity for the three and six months ended April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010 was as follows:
 
The components of product warranty liability are as follows:
 
Note 11. Deferred Revenue
The components of deferred revenue are as follows:
 
Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity at our request. The term of the indemnification period is upon the later of (i) ten years after the person has ceased being an officer or director, or (ii) the termination of all pending or threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We enter into indemnification agreements in the normal course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, such as our customers or partners, in connection with any patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products. We seek to limit liability for such indemnity, for example to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products subject to the indemnification obligations. The term of these indemnification agreements may vary, although in many instances, is perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited. Based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We also indemnify certain customers with respect to damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental claims related to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, officers, authorized agents or subcontractors. We have general and umbrella insurance policies that limit our exposure under these indemnification obligations and guarantees. As a result of our insurance policy coverage and based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
 
Prior to the spin-off of Varian Semiconductor from Varian Associates, Inc., or VAI, Varian Semiconductor's business was operated as the Semiconductor Equipment Business, or SEB, of VAI. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, its Instruments Business to Varian, Inc., or VI, and changed its name to Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or VMS. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. In connection with the spin-off from VAI, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI entered into certain agreements which include a Distribution Agreement, an Employee Benefits Allocation Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, and a Transition Services Agreement, (collectively, the Distribution Related Agreements) whereby Varian Semiconductor agreed to indemnify VMS and VI for any costs, liabilities or expenses relating to Varian Semiconductor's legal proceedings. Under the Distribution Related Agreements, Varian Semiconductor has agreed to reimburse VMS for one-third of the costs, liabilities, and expenses, adjusted for any related tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS, with respect to certain legal proceedings relating to discontinued operations of VMS. We believe, the difference between the estimated fair value of the indemnification agreements and the amounts recorded in our financial statements, is minimal.
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and/or local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These include laws regarding discharges into soil, water and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. In addition, several countries are reviewing proposed regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose of their products at the end of a product's useful life. These laws have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of certain operations.
We also enter into purchase order commitments in the normal course of business. As of April 1, 2011, we had $112.3 million of purchase order commitments with various suppliers. In addition, we maintain vendor liability agreements whereby product can be delivered within our lead time requirements. As of April 1, 2011, our maximum liability under these arrangements was approximately $38.0 million.
Environmental Remediation
VAI has been named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, at eight sites where VAI is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal. VAI is also involved in various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in consultation with, foreign, federal, state and/or local agencies at certain current or former VAI facilities (including facilities disposed of in connection with VAI's sale of its Electron Devices business during fiscal year 1995, and the sale of its Thin Film Systems business during fiscal year 1997). The Distribution Related Agreements provide that each of VMS, Varian Semiconductor and VI will indemnify the others for one-third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs, as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs.
For certain of these sites and facilities, various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken. Per the estimates provided by VMS, we have accrued $0.9 million in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities as of April 1, 2011. As to other sites and facilities, sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to reasonably estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities. As such, we have accrued $3.8 million as of April 1, 2011, which represents future costs discounted at 4%, net of inflation, to cover our portion of these costs. This reserve is in addition to the $0.9 million as of April 1, 2011, as previously described.
As of April 1, 2011, our environmental liability, based upon future environmental-related costs estimated by VMS as of that date and included in current and long-term accrued expenses, totaled $4.7 million, of which $1.0 million is classified as current.
The amounts set forth in the foregoing paragraph are only estimates of anticipated future environmental-related costs, and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates. The aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation and remediation activities and the large number of sites where VMS is undertaking such investigation and remediation activities. VMS believes that most of these cost ranges will narrow as investigation and remediation activities progress. We believe that our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of the obligations become more clearly defined, these reserves may be modified and related charges against income may be made.
Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available to management and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, our management believes that the costs of these
 
environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our liability for environmental-related investigation and remediation in light of the liability and financial strength of potentially responsible parties and insurance companies where we believe that we have rights to contribution, indemnity and/or reimbursement. Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already incurred, and to be incurred in the future, have been asserted against various insurance companies and other third parties. VMS receives certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants, its insurers and other third parties from time to time. VMS has also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures. Accordingly, we have recorded a receivable for approximately $1.1 million at each of April 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010 which was included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding, written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has, in the past, paid the claims that VMS has made.
Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to legal disputes. While we believe we have meritorious claims and/or defenses with respect to each dispute, we cannot predict the outcome of each such dispute. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these disputes, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.
Note 13. Comprehensive Income
The following table reconciles net income to comprehensive income, net of tax effect, for the three and six months ended April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010:
 
Note 14. Share Repurchase Plan
Our board of directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to $900.0 million of our common stock on the open market. The program does not have a fixed expiration date. As of April 1, 2011, approximately $123.6 million remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization.
We repurchased the following shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan during the three and six months ended April 1, 2011:
 
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2010.
We repurchased an additional 140,400 shares between April 1, 2011 and April 26, 2011, the latest practicable date prior to the filing date of this report.
Note 15. Operating Segments and Geographic Information
We have determined that we operate in one business segment: the manufacturing, marketing and servicing of semiconductor processing equipment for ion implantation systems. Since we operate in one segment, all financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
We expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue in the foreseeable future. For the three months ended April 1, 2011, revenue from two customers accounted for 28% and 15% of our total revenue. For the three months ended April 2, 2010, revenue from two customers accounted for 28% and 16% of our total revenue. For the six months ended April 1, 2011, revenue from two customers accounted for 27% and 12% of our total revenue. For the six months ended April 2, 2010, revenue from three customers accounted for 29%, 14% and 10% of our total revenue.
As of April 1, 2011, two customers represented 28% and 13%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balance. As of October 1, 2010, four customers accounted for 12%, 11%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balance.
The following table summarizes revenue based on final geographic destination and long-lived assets by geography:
 
Note 16. Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on the tax laws and statutory rates applied to our expected annual earnings from operations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world.
 
Our income tax provision was $20.9 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 and $10.0 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2010. Our tax rate was 12% and 15% for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively, including discrete items. Discrete benefits for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 were $3.6 million and include $1.8 million from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and experimentation credit, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 million due to the lapse of statutes of limitations, $0.6 million related to tax return adjustments offset by interest accrued on uncertain tax positions and other discrete items. The discrete income tax benefit related to these items in the first six months of fiscal year 2011 decreased the tax rate by approximately 2% for that period. Discrete net benefits for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 were $1.8 million and primarily relate to the release of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and tax return adjustments offset by interest accrued on uncertain tax positions. The discrete income tax net benefit related to these items in the first six months of fiscal year 2010 decreased the tax rate by approximately 3%.
The tax rate for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 differed from the statutory tax rate of 35% due to income earned in low tax jurisdictions, the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and experimentation credit, reversals of tax reserves, and tax return adjustments.
The net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits during the first six months of fiscal year 2011 was $7.5 million due to positions taken in the current quarter offset by reserve releases. As of April 1, 2011, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $70.1 million, of which $68.2 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective rate consists of items that are offset by deferred tax assets, relating to state tax credits which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. As of April 1, 2011, the total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $5.2 million. We will re-examine the tax provision and the effect of estimated unrecognized tax benefits on our financial position at the end of each reporting period. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The statute of limitations for our tax filings with federal, state and foreign tax authorities is open for fiscal years 2003 through the present. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, commenced an examination of fiscal year 2007 in December 2008. The IRS completed examinations of certain refund claims filed for fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and we filed a protest of the refund claim audit findings with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The IRS audit of fiscal year 2007 is continuing and has been extended to include fiscal year 2009. It is unknown whether agreement on the refund claims or resolution of the IRS audit of fiscal year 2007 will be reached within the next twelve months. The favorable resolution of the claims filed with the Appeals Office could result in a benefit to the tax provision of up to $5.8 million, excluding interest. Based on the status of the IRS audit, it is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of any changes to our previously recorded uncertain tax positions. It is possible that up to $3.2 million of unrecognized tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, may be recognized within one year as the result of the lapse of statutes of limitations.
 

Exhibit 99.3
Introduction to unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
On May 3, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied"), Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied ("Merger Sub"), and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Merger Sub will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into Varian (the "Merger"), with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the effective date of the Merger had occurred on May 1, 2011. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the twelve months ended October 31, 2010 and the six months ended May 1, 2011 are presented as if the effective date of the Merger had occurred on October 26, 2009. The preliminary estimate of purchase consideration is calculated as if the Merger had taken place on May 1, 2011. This information should be read in conjunction with the:
 
 
 
 
 
Because Applied's second fiscal quarter ended on May 1, 2011 and Varian's second fiscal quarter ended on April 1, 2011, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical balances of Applied and Varian as of those dates, with pro forma adjustments. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations combine the historical results of Applied for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010 and for the six months ended May 1, 2011, with the historical results of Varian for the twelve months ended October 1, 2010 and the six months ended April 1, 2011, respectively, with pro forma adjustments. No adjustments were made to either Applied's or Varian's reported information for the different period end dates.
The pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Merger had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Applied believes are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that the combined company may achieve as a result of the Merger or the costs to integrate the operations of Applied and Varian or the costs necessary to achieve any cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements.
Pursuant to the purchase method of accounting, the estimated purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated respective fair values. Applied management has determined the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the pro forma combined balance sheet date. The excess of the fair value of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the purchase price and the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, therefore, the actual amounts recorded upon completion of the Merger may differ materially from the information presented herein. A final determination of these estimated fair values will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Varian existing on the date of completion of the Merger.
There were no intercompany transactions between Applied and Varian as of the dates and for the periods of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Applied and Varian and other financial information pertaining to Applied and Varian including Applied's management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors.

Basis of presentation
On May 3, 2011, Applied, Merger Sub, and Varian, entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into Varian, with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume the cash payment of $63.00 for each outstanding share of Varian common stock. For the purposes of these preliminary pro forma financial statements, the total cash payment was estimated at $4.7 billion based on shares outstanding as at April 29, 2011. The actual cash payment will be determined based on the actual number of shares of Varian common stock outstanding upon the completion of the Merger. The estimated cash payment includes (i) the conversion of each share of Varian common stock into the right to receive $63.00 per share, (ii) the cancellation of vested options granted under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Varian, as well as certain other options identified by Applied prior to the effective date of the Merger, and replacement with the right to receive $63.00 per share in cash, less the applicable option exercise price, and (iii) the cancellation of vested and unvested restricted stock units and replacement with the right to receive $63.00 per share in cash. All cash payments for equity awards will be subject to applicable tax withholdings, if any.
In addition, on the effective date of the Merger, each vested option granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan of Varian that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective date, other than certain options identified by Applied, will be converted into a fully vested option to purchase Applied common stock, either by Applied assuming that stock option or replacing it with a reasonably equivalent option to purchase Applied common stock based on a conversion ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. The estimated fair value of these converted options is $27 million and was included in the total preliminary estimated merger consideration.
At the effective date of the Merger, each unvested stock option, other than certain options identified by Applied, will be converted into an option to purchase Applied common stock, to be effected by Applied either assuming that stock option or replacing it with a reasonably equivalent option to purchase Applied common stock based on a conversion ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. Based on the number of Varian unvested stock options outstanding at April 29, 2011, without taking into account the Varian stock options that will be cancelled in connection with the Merger, Applied would convert options to purchase approximately 1.3 million shares of Varian common stock into options to purchase approximately 5.4 million shares of Applied common stock with an approximate value of $45 million. A portion of this amount, representing the options that are earned but not vested, will be attributable to Merger consideration. Based on unvested stock options outstanding at April 29, 2011, we estimate that this amount will be approximately $25 million. This portion of the earned options is included in the total merger consideration. The amount not included in the purchase price will be recorded as compensation expense in the post-Merger combined Statement of Operations in the periods that the compensation is earned. The actual number of Applied stock options into which Varian common stock options will be converted will be determined based on the actual number of Varian common stock options outstanding and the price of Applied common stock at the completion of the Merger.
Each outstanding, unvested share of Varian restricted common stock that is subject to a risk of forfeiture, a repurchase option or other condition pursuant to an applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Varian will be exchanged for a future cash
payment based on the same per-share Merger consideration as other shares of Varian common stock. Based on the total number of shares of Varian unvested restricted common stock outstanding at April 29, 2011, Applied will pay approximately $82 million in cash for the unvested outstanding shares of Varian restricted common stock. A portion of this amount, representing the shares that are earned but not vested, will be attributable to merger consideration. Based on unvested restricted common stock outstanding at April 29, 2011, we estimate that this amount will be approximately $31 million. The amount not included in the purchase price will be recorded as compensation expense in the post-Merger combined Statement of Operations in the periods that the compensation is earned. The actual cash payment will be determined based on the actual number of unvested shares of Varian restricted common stock outstanding upon the completion of the Merger.
The estimated purchase price and the allocation of the estimated purchase price discussed below are preliminary as the proposed Merger has not yet been completed. The actual purchase price will be based on the number of outstanding shares of Varian common stock, options to purchase common stock, and shares of restricted common stock upon the completion of the Merger.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to Varian's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the Merger. For purposes of this presentation the estimated Merger consideration has been allocated based on preliminary estimates of fair values that are described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The allocation of the estimated preliminary Merger consideration, estimated useful lives and first year amortization and incremental depreciation associated with certain acquired assets are as follows (in millions):
 
A preliminary estimate of $863 million has been allocated to net tangible assets acquired and approximately $1,450 million has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The amortization related to the amortizable intangible assets and additional depreciation resulting from the increase in PP&E to fair value are reflected as pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
.    Developed technology relates to Varian's products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility. Developed technology represents a combination of Varian's processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of their products. Applied expects to amortize the fair value of the acquired product rights based on the anticipated time frame in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be recognized, which is assumed to be a straight-line amortization.
Identifiable intangible assets
The estimated fair value of customer contracts and relationships are expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be recognized.
In-process research and development includes research and development for products that have not yet reached technological feasibility. Amortization of these amounts will begin at the time that the respective products reach technological feasibility. If a research and development project ends, the associated in-process research and development asset will be written down to zero in the period in which the project ends.
As of the effective date of the Merger, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value. These acquired assets could include assets that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, it is assumed that all assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those assets.
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act ("HSR Act") and other relevant laws and regulations, there are significant limitations regarding what Applied can learn about the specifics of the Varian intangible assets prior to the completion of the Merger. Obtaining the necessary information to complete the valuation of such intangible assets could take several months. As a result, the final determination of the values of such intangible assets will differ from these preliminary valuations and the differences could be material. Applied will update the preliminary valuation of the acquired intangible assets as at the effective date of the Merger.
.    Approximately $2.5 billion has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that management of the combined company determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
Goodwill
Pro forma adjustments
Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect (i) the estimated purchase price; (ii) amounts related to Varian's net tangible and intangible assets at an amount equal to the preliminary estimates of their fair values; (iii) the amortization expense related to the estimated amortizable intangible assets; (iv) changes in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the preliminary estimated fair value adjustments to net tangible and intangible assets; and (v) the income tax effect related to the pro forma adjustments.
There were no intercompany balances and transactions between Applied and Varian as of the dates and for the periods of these pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
The pro forma combined provision for income taxes does not necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted had Applied and Varian filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include liabilities that may result from integration activities which are not presently estimable. Liabilities ultimately may be recorded for severance costs for employees, costs of vacating certain facilities, or other costs associated with exiting activities that would affect the pro forma financial statements. Management of Applied and Varian are in the process of making these assessments and estimates of these costs are not currently known.
Applied has not identified any pre-Merger contingencies in which the related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount of the asset, liability or impairment can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period, if information becomes available which would indicate it is probable that such events have occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the purchase price allocation.
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are as follows:

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 1, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as representatives of the several underwriters named in the agreement. The Underwriting Agreement provides for the issuance and sale by Applied of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion (collectively, the "Notes") in the following tranches:
 
 
 
The Notes will be issued and sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174636) and related preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2011, and a related final prospectus supplement filed on June 2, 2011. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Applied, and customary closing conditions, indemnification rights and termination provisions.
Applied expects that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately $1.73 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. Applied intends to use the net proceeds to fund a portion of the consideration payable in, and certain costs associated with, Applied's proposed merger with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 3, 2011, by and among Applied, Varian and Barcelona Acquisition Corp., as described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied on May 4, 2011.
The above description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting"; the information relating to making a market in the Securities in the seventh
Indemnification of the Company.
 
paragraph under the caption "Underwriting"; and the information related to stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids contained in the eighth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting".
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such reasonable and documented fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment to the extent such Indemnified Person would be entitled to be indemnified for such loss or liability under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) hereof. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and

indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by   allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

rata
 
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date: (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or ((iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
9. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
10. .
Payment of Expenses

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
11. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof.

Applied Materials, Inc.

In the Prospectus Supplement dated June 1, 2011, Applied assumed for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that it would raise $1.5 billion, instead of $1.75 billion, in gross proceeds in this offering. As a result, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the adjustments that would have resulted from the incremental capital raise, including a corresponding reduction in short-term debt and corresponding changes to net interest expense for the periods presented.

On June 8, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into an indenture (the "Base Indenture") and a first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and referred to together with the Base Indenture as the "Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, to establish the terms and form of those certain senior unsecured notes issued by Applied in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes consist of the following tranches: $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.650% senior unsecured notes due 2016; $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.300% senior unsecured notes due 2021; and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.850% senior unsecured notes due 2041. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2011.
Applied previously entered into an Underwriting Agreement dated June 1, 2011 in connection with sale of the Notes, as described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 6, 2011. The Notes were sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174636) and related preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on June 1, 2011, and a related final prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on June 2, 2011.
Applied intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes to fund a portion of the consideration payable in, and certain costs associated with, Applied's proposed merger (the "Merger") with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 3, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Applied, Varian and Barcelona Acquisition Corp., as described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied on May 4, 2011. In the event that Applied does not consummate the Merger on or before May 31, 2012 or the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior to said date, Applied will be required to redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Applied may also be required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change in control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, and it may elect to redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time, as further specified in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains limited affirmative and negative covenants of Applied. The negative covenants restrict the ability of Applied and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens on its principal property or on shares of stock of its principal subsidiaries; to engage in sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any principal property; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.
Events of default under the Indenture include a failure to make payments, non-performance of affirmative and negative covenants, and bankruptcy and insolvency-related events. Applied's obligations may be accelerated upon an event of default, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would become immediately due and payable.
The foregoing description of certain terms of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture, which is filed with this report as Exhibit 4.1, and the Supplemental Indenture, which is filed with this report as Exhibit 4.2, and incorporated herein by reference.

Redemption
The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01.
Section 3.02 .
Notice of Redemption
(a) If the Company desires to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, or shall instruct the Trustee in writing to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register (unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed). Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of
 
such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that: (i) payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, or, if none, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities; (ii) interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice; (iii) from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; (iv) the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and (v) the CUSIP and/or other similar number as contemplated by, and containing the disclaimers and other language contemplated by, Section 2.12. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
(b) If all or less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 15 days' written notice (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) in advance of the date the Company gives notice to the Securityholders of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee thereupon shall select from Securities of such series Outstanding not previously called for redemption, in accordance with a method determined by the Trustee (in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of such Securities of such series of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Securities of such series to be redeemed. The Trustee promptly shall notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities of such series to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Company, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by any of its Officers, may instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section 3.02, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name, as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section 3.02.
Section 3.03 .
Payment Upon Redemption
(a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, in each case as established pursuant to Section 2.01. Interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date
 
fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, such Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, that, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Securityholders of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) registered as such at the close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03.
(b) Upon presentation of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute a new Security of the same series and tenor of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and the Trustee shall authenticate, and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, such Security; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute a new Global Security of like tenor in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered and, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate requesting authentication and delivery, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, such Global Security.

Sinking Fund
The provisions of this Section 3.04 and Sections 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
Section 3.05 .
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
The Company (i) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any Securities previously called for redemption) and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.06 .
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of the series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency in which the Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.01), the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and
 
crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit. Together with such Officer's Certificate, the Company will deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 15 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
The following covenants shall apply to the Securities, except with respect to any series of Securities for which the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series expressly provides that any such covenant shall not apply to such series of Securities:
Section 4.01 .
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
The Company will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of a series at the time and place and in the manner provided herein and established with respect to such Securities.

Such designation will continue with respect to each office or agency until the Company, by written notice signed by any Officer and delivered to the Trustee, shall designate some other office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Company initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of U.S. Bank National Association, acting as the Company's agent, as the office to be maintained by it for each such purpose.

(b) The Company shall require each paying agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the paying agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all funds held by the paying agent for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities, and will
 
promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the paying agent (including the Company or any of their Subsidiaries serving as the paying agent) shall have no further liability for the funds. If the Company or any of their Subsidiaries acts as paying agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Securityholders all funds held by it as paying agent.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (i) the agreement to hold funds in trust as provided in this Section 4.03 is subject to the provisions of Section 11.06, and (ii) the Company at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of this Indenture or for any other purpose, may pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all funds held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such funds to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such funds were held by the Company or such paying agent. Upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such funds.
Section 4.04 .
Statement by Officers as to Default

If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) or 6.01(a)(5) occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities shall automatically become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
(c) At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the amount due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has or has caused to be paid or deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit), and (ii) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series that shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06.
No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceedings, the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
(e) The Trustee shall give to the Securityholders of any series, as the names and addresses of such Holders appear on the Security Register, notice by mail of all defaults known to the Trustee that have occurred with respect to such series, such notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice (the term "default" or "defaults" for the purposes of this Section 6.01(e) being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as its board
 
of directors, executive committee, or trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
Section 6.02 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
(a) The Company covenants that (i) in case it shall default in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of a series, or any payment required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to that series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days, or (ii) in case it shall default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, on any of the Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of a series or upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have been become due and payable on all such Securities for principal, premium, if any, or interest, or both, with interest upon the overdue principal, premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
(b) If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the amounts so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company and collect the amounts adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, wherever situated.
(c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceedings affecting the Company or its respective creditors or property, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company under this Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount that may become due and payable by the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any funds or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 6.03. Any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
(d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto. Any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
 
In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee in its discretion may proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.03 .
Application of Funds Collected
Any funds collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI with respect to a particular series of Securities shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such funds on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the Securities of that series, and notation thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Securities of such series for principal, premium, if any, and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such funds have been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: To the Company.
Section 6.04 .
Limitation on Suits
No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default; (ii) the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and (v) during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security (or in the
 
case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder. By accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6.04, each Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
Section 6.05 .
Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission not Waiver
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article VI to the Trustee or to the Securityholders, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Securities.
(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or on acquiescence therein. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
Section 6.06 .
Control by Securityholders
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Securities of any other series at the time Outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, shall determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series, may rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except (i) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series; or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights
 
hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.07 .
Undertaking to Pay Costs
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by such holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 6.07 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.
Section 6.08 .
Waiver of Usury, Stay Or Extension Laws
Each of the Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation.
If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee. On the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of its charges, shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and funds held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (ii) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, and such retiring Trustee shall have no further responsibility with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture.

(d) No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article VII.
(e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 7.11, the successor trustee shall cause a notice of its succession to be transmitted to Securityholders.

In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 8.01 .
Evidence of Action by Securityholders
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided, however, that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
 
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 6.01, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 6.04 or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 6.06, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided, however, that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
Section 8.02 .
Proof of Execution by Securityholders
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
(b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
 
(c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
Section 8.03 .
Who May be Deemed Owners
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 8.04 .
Certain Securities Owned by Company Disregarded
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent of waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by an Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not an Affiliate. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities of a particular series, if any known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described Persons and, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities of such particular series not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Section 8.05 .
Actions Binding on Future Securityholders
At any time prior to the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, may revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or
 
in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.
Section 9.01 .

In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Company and the Trustee from time to time and at any time may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect), without the consent of the Securityholders, for one or more of the following purposes:
(a) to cure any ambiguity, defect, or inconsistency herein or in the Securities of any series;

(d) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities;
(e) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders of all or any outstanding series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all outstanding series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company;
(f) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the holders of all or any outstanding series of Securities (and if such Events of Default are to be applicable to less than all outstanding series, stating that such Events of Default are expressly being included solely to be applicable to such series);
(g) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;
(h) to secure the Securities of any series;
(i) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder of Outstanding Securities;
 
(j) to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of the Securities of any series as provided in Section 2.01, to provide which, if any, of the covenants of the Company shall apply to such series, and to provide which of the Events of Default shall apply to such series or to define the rights of the holders of such series of Securities;
(k) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
(l) to issue additional Securities of any series; provided that such additional Securities have the same terms as, and be deemed part of the same series as, the applicable series of Securities issued hereunder to the extent required by Section 2.01(b); or
(m) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust hereunder by more than one Trustee.

Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section 9.01 may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of any of the Securities at the time Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 9.02.
Section 9.02 .
Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Securityholders
With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.01) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures, the Company, when authorized by Board Resolutions, and the Trustee from time to time and at any time may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner not covered by Section 9.01 the rights of the holders of the Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security then Outstanding and affected thereby, shall

(iii) modify any of the provisions of this Section or Section 6.06, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of Securityholders of a series affected thereby under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9.02, the Company shall mail or caused to be mailed a notice thereof by first class mail to the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security Register, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture.

(c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series have been complied with.

Section 11.03 .
Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations; Covenant Defeasance
(a) If at any time:
(i) all such Securities of a particular series not heretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that have not become due and payable as described in Section 11.02 shall have been paid by the Company by depositing irrevocably with the Trustee in trust funds or an amount of Governmental Obligations sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all such Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal, premium, if any, and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be, and
(ii) the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series,
then, after the date such funds or Governmental Obligations, as the case may be, are deposited with the Trustee, the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such series shall cease to be of further effect except, to the extent applicable to each, for the following provisions that shall survive until such Securities shall mature and be paid: (A) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 11.03(c) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when due, (B) the Company's obligation with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 4.02, 4.03, 7.05 and 7.10 hereof, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article XI.

covenant defeasance
 
Indenture. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of a series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a)(3) or otherwise, but except as specified in this Section 11.03(b), the remainder of the Company's obligations under the Securities of such series, this Indenture, and any indentures supplemental to this Indenture with respect to such series shall be unaffected thereby.
(c) The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 11.03 to the Outstanding Securities of the applicable series:

(ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent specified herein relating to defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect;
(iii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become such an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, on the date of such deposit;
(iv) in the event of an election under Section 11.03(a), the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge were not to occur;
(v) in the event of an election under Section 11.03(b), the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur; and
 
(vi) notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 11.03, such covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company pursuant to Section 2.01.
After such irrevocable deposit made pursuant to this Section 11.03 and satisfaction of the other conditions set forth herein, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 11.03.
Section 11.04 .
Deposited Funds to be Held in Trust
All funds or Governmental Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Sections 11.02 or 11.03 shall be held in trust and shall be available for payment as due, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Company acting as its own paying agent), to the holders of the particular series of Securities for the payment or redemption of which such funds or Governmental Obligations have been deposited with the Trustee.
Section 11.05 .
Payment of Funds Held by Paying Agents
In connection with the provisions of Section 11.02 or 11.03, all funds or Governmental Obligations then held by any paying agent under the provisions of this Indenture shall, upon demand of the Company, be paid to the Trustee and thereupon such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such funds or Governmental Obligations.
Section 11.06 .
Repayment to the Company
Any funds or Governmental Obligations deposited with any paying agent or the Trustee, or then held by the Company, in trust for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of a particular series that are not applied but remain unclaimed by the holders of such Securities for at least one year after the date upon which the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Securities shall have respectively become due and payable, shall, upon request of the Company, be repaid to the Company, or if then held by the Company shall be discharged from such trust; and thereafter, the paying agent and the Trustee shall be released from all further liability with respect to such funds or Governmental Obligations, and the holder of any of the Securities entitled to receive such payment shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company, as applicable, for the payment thereof. Anything in this Article XI to the contrary notwithstanding, subject to Section 7.06, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon request by the Company any funds or Governmental Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Sections 11.02 or 11.03 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, in accordance with this Article XI.

Santa Clara, California 95052-8039
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 1, 2011 of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), that is automatically effective under the Act pursuant to Rule 462(e) promulgated thereunder. The Registration Statement relates to, among other things, the proposed issuance and sale, from time to time, by the Company of debt securities with an indeterminate amount as may at various times be issued at indeterminate prices, in reliance on Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(e) under the Act.
Under the Registration Statement, the Company has issued $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2.650% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes"), $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 4.300% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $600,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.850% Senior Notes due 2041 (the "2041 Notes" and together with the 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated June 1, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined the Registration Statement, together with the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein; the base prospectus, dated June 1, 2011, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, filed with the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"); the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated June 1, 2011, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes; the final prospectus supplement, dated June 1, 2011, in the form filed with Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes (collectively with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus Supplement"); the Indenture and the Notes. In addition, we have examined such other instruments, documents, certificates and records which we have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of our opinion hereinafter expressed. In such examination, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; (iii) the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates we have reviewed; (iv) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered

by the parties thereto (other than the Company); (v) the legal capacity of all natural persons; and (vi) that the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture and that the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company.
We express no opinion as to any matter relating to laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and the laws of the State of New York, as such are in effect on the date hereof, and we have made no inquiry into, and we express no opinion as to, the statutes, regulations, treaties, common laws or other laws of any other nation, state or jurisdiction. We are not licensed to practice law in the State of Delaware and, accordingly, our opinions as to the DGCL are based solely on a review of the official statutes of the State of Delaware and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such statues and provisions.
We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) rights to indemnification and contribution which may be limited by applicable law or equitable principles, or (iii) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, the effect of judicial discretion and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, and limitations on rights of acceleration, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
On the basis of the foregoing and in reliance thereon and having regard for legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you that in our opinion the Notes have been validly issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the above-referenced Registration Statement and to the use of our name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and in any amendment or supplement thereto. In giving such consent, we do not believe that we are "experts" within the meaning of such term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion as an exhibit or otherwise.

ITEM: Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Other Events
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 31, 2011 and incorporated herein by reference, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") disclosed that it had entered into a Bridge Loan Agreement (the "Bridge Loan Agreement") for a US$2 billion term loan facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan") as administrative agent; Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley") and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") as syndication agents; and other lenders named in the agreement (collectively, the "Bridge Lenders"). The purpose of the Bridge Loan Agreement was to make available funding for a portion of the cash consideration to be paid by Applied in connection with Applied's proposed acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 3, 2011 (the "Merger"), which proposed Merger is described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2011.
Under the terms of the Bridge Loan Agreement, the $2 billion commitment under the agreement was reduced by the amount of the proceeds, less the underwriting discount, from Applied's issuance and sale of senior unsecured notes (the "Notes"), which totaled approximately $1.74 billion. The issuance and sale of the Notes was described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 9, 2011. In light of the issuance and sale of the Notes, Applied terminated the Bridge Loan Agreement effective as of June 14, 2011. Applied made no borrowings under the Bridge Loan Agreement and there were no outstanding loan amounts due under the agreement at termination.
JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citibank and the other Bridge Lenders, and certain of their affiliates, have engaged in, and/or in the future may engage in, banking and other transactions with Applied, including providing previous and current credit facilities and serving as underwriters of the Notes. These parties have received, and/or in the future may receive, customary compensation from Applied for these services.
 
On June 13, 2011, Applied received a request for additional information from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") in connection with the Merger. The request for additional information is part of the regulatory process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR Act"). Applied intends to respond promptly to the request and will continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ as the DOJ conducts its review.
The effect of the DOJ's request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Applied has substantially complied with the request and Varian has substantially complied with the request that it received. Closing of the proposed merger with Varian remains subject to DOJ approval under the HSR Act, certain other foreign regulatory approvals, and approval by Varian's stockholders, among other conditions.
 
Additional Information and Where to Find It
This communication may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the proposed Merger. In connection with the proposed Merger, Varian filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 7, 2011. The definitive proxy statement will be sent or given to the stockholders of Varian and will contain important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT CAREFULLY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. The proxy statement and other relevant materials (when they become available), and any other documents filed by Varian with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website, at www.sec.gov.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 24, 2011  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT), the world's leading supplier of manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended July 31, 2011. Applied generated orders of $2.39 billion, net sales of $2.79 billion, operating income of $687 million, and net income of $476 million or $0.36 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $683 million, and non-GAAP net income was $467 million or $0.35 per share.
"Applied delivered solid third quarter results, with earnings and revenue at the upper end of our expectations," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer. "While the fundamental drivers of our markets remain strong, we are seeing softness in our business resulting from the uncertain economic environment and overcapacity in solar."
"Our cumulative net sales and non-GAAP earnings per share over the past four quarters have been the strongest in the company's history," said George Davis, chief financial officer. "In our most recent quarter, Applied generated nearly $600 million in operating cash flow and issued $1.75 billion in long-term debt to support the Varian acquisition."
Financial Results Summary
 
Applied's Q3 FY2010 results included $405 million in charges associated with the EES restructuring plan announced in July 2010, consisting in part of $250 million in inventory-related charges that reduced GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.12. Non-GAAP results for the above periods exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions, certain discrete tax items, certain acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, and gain or loss on sale of facilities. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statements included in this release. See also "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.

Fiscal Third Quarter Reportable Segment Results and Comparisons to the Prior Quarter
Silicon Systems Group (SSG) orders were $1.24 billion, down 28 percent primarily due to weaker demand in foundry. Net sales were $1.40 billion, down 4 percent. Operating income decreased to $452 million or 32 percent of net sales, reflecting the lower revenue. New order composition was: foundry 37 percent, logic and other 25 percent, flash 23 percent, and DRAM 15 percent.
Applied Global Services (AGS) orders were $613 million, up 2 percent. Net sales were $603 million, down 2 percent. Operating income increased by 61 percent to $146 million or 24 percent of net sales driven primarily by higher margins in 200 millimeter equipment as well as services.
Display orders were $220 million, down 14 percent due primarily to reduced demand from LCD TV customers. Net sales were $223 million, up 41 percent, and operating income increased to $58 million or 26 percent of net sales.
Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) orders were $318 million, down 48 percent as customers digested record capital additions in recent quarters. Net sales were $563 million, down 12 percent. Operating income decreased to $123 million or 22 percent of net sales and included $3 million in asset impairment charges.
Additional Quarterly Financial Information
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied expects net sales to be down in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent sequentially. The company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.24. The non-GAAP EPS outlook excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of approximately $0.01 per share, but does not exclude other non-GAAP adjustments that may arise subsequent to this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") disclosed in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 26, 2011, it previously had requested a refund of a portion of the U.S. federal income tax paid in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Following an audit, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") recommended that Applied receive a cash refund in the amount of approximately $240 million plus interest, which recommendation was subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress.
On August 29, 2011, Applied received notice from the IRS that the Joint Committee on Taxation had completed its review and had taken no exception to the conclusions of the IRS. Accordingly, Applied expects to receive a cash refund from the IRS in the amount of $277 million (including interest) during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 that ends on October 30, 2011. Applied expects to recognize a tax benefit of $177 million, or approximately $0.13 per diluted share, from this cash refund in its consolidated statement of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which is net of previously-recognized tax benefits.
Safe Harbor Statement
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to expected receipt of a cash refund of $277 million and the tax effect. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements including, without limitation, (i) risks related to the amount and timing of the cash refund and associated tax benefit; and (ii) other risks described in Applied's SEC filings, including its most recent Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date of this report, and Applied undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On November 10, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Applied"), completed its previously-announced acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Varian"). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 3, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied ("Merger Sub"), merged with and into Varian (the "Merger"), with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Varian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into the right to receive $63 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (excluding shares that were: (i) held by Applied, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied; or (ii) held by Varian or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Varian, or held in Varian's treasury). As also provided under the Merger Agreement, certain equity awards held by employees of Varian were converted into cash equal to the difference between the Merger Consideration and the exercise price, if any, of such awards, while other equity awards held by employees of Varian were assumed by Applied and converted into equity awards of Applied on terms substantially equivalent to the terms of the original awards.
The aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration was approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. Applied funded the Merger Consideration and certain costs associated with the Merger through a combination of existing cash balances and the net proceeds of the senior unsecured notes that Applied issued on June 8, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 10, 2011, Applied issued a press release announcing the completion of the acquisition of Varian, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 10, 2011  Applied Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMAT) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Nasdaq: VSEA). The acquisition of Varian enhances Applied's extensive portfolio with market-leading ion implantation technology, a market that represents an annual opportunity approaching $1.5 billion.
"Global demand for mobile devices with higher performance and longer battery life is fueling new innovations in semiconductor technology focused on the complex transistors at the heart of next generation chips," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer of Applied Materials. "The combination of Applied and Varian will create the industry leader in transistor technologies and allow us to partner with our customers to find innovative solutions for smaller, faster, power-efficient devices."
The new Varian Semiconductor Equipment business unit is based in Gloucester, MA, and is led by Bob Halliday, group vice president and general manager. Mr. Halliday reports to Dr. Randhir Thakur, executive vice president and general manager of Applied's Silicon Systems Group, which supplies semiconductor manufacturing technology to every chipmaker around the world.
"Varian's exceptional team and focus on device performance and yield improvement strongly complement Applied's capabilities," said Dr. Thakur. "Together, we can significantly enhance our value to customers in helping them with their most complex challenges to extend Moore's Law far into the future."
On November 10, 2011, Varian became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied. As a result, each outstanding share of Varian common stock (other than shares owned by Applied or Varian) was automatically converted into the right to receive $63.00 in cash (without interest). Holders of Varian common stock will receive a letter of transmittal that will instruct them on how to receive the merger consideration. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Varian equity awards were either converted to the right to receive cash or assumed by Applied. The aggregate purchase price of the merger was approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired.

Exhibit 99.2
The following financial statements of the Registrant and its subsidiaries are required to be included in Item 8:
 
The following financial statement schedule of the Registrant and its subsidiaries for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrant and its subsidiaries:
 
All other required schedules are omitted because of the absence of conditions under which they are required or because the required information is given in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2010, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for fair value measurements in fiscal year 2009.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian Semiconductor," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits to customers located both in the United States, or U.S., and in international markets. We face risk factors similar to all companies in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market including, but not limited to, competition, market downturn, technological change, international operations and related foreign currency risks and the ability to recruit and retain key employees.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Varian Semiconductor and its subsidiaries and have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP.
 
Revisions
During the quarter ended October 2, 2009, we identified certain instances dating back to fiscal year 1999 in which deferred income taxes and long-term tax liabilities were not properly recorded in our financial statements. These adjustments individually and in the aggregate were not material to our financial statements for all periods impacted. We have revised our historical financial statements to properly reflect these adjustments.
We recorded adjustments to increase deferred tax assets or reduce long-term tax liabilities and decrease income tax expense, resulting in an increase of net income, or reduction in net loss, by $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended July 3, 2009 and fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts in the footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period that ends on the Friday nearest September 30. Fiscal year 2010 was comprised of a 52-week period ended on October 1, 2010. Fiscal year 2009 was comprised of a 52-week period ended on October 2, 2009. Fiscal year 2008 was comprised of a 53-week period ended on October 3, 2008.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, deferred revenue, loss contingencies, warranty accruals, the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, and allowance for doubtful accounts. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
 
 
Revenue Recognition
Product revenue is comprised of established and new products including tools, upgrades and spare parts.
We recognize revenue from tool sales upon shipment, provided that title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are contractually fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements.
We generally follow predetermined criteria for changing the classification of a new tool to an established tool. We generally recognize tools as established after demonstrating success in achieving customer acceptance of the same tool type and specification, for the same or similar application. In most circumstances, once a new tool achieves the predetermined criteria, the tool is considered established. Furthermore, prior installation costs on the tool type can also influence the evaluation of tool maturity on a going forward basis.
Tools are classified as established if the installation process and the post-delivery acceptance provisions are deemed routine, and there is a demonstrated history of achieving the predetermined established tool criteria. The majority of tools are designed and manufactured to meet contractual customer specifications, and established tools must have been demonstrated to meet customer specifications before shipment.
For established and new tools, a portion of the total purchase price is typically not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the tool. For established tools, the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount due upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery. The amount deferred for installation is recognized as service revenue upon customer acceptance and any remaining deferral is recognized as product revenue. For new tools, revenue is not recognized until customer acceptance. Spare parts and upgrade sales are typically recognized as revenue upon the later of delivery or the transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer.
Service revenue includes revenue from maintenance and service contracts, extended warranties, paid service and system installation services. Revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts. Extended warranty revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable warranty term. Revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation and customer acceptance. It generally takes approximately three to six weeks for our technicians to complete the installation of our products and perform tests agreed to with customers. Certain customers formally document their acceptance of our products at this time. Other customers elect to perform additional internal testing prior to formal acceptance, and this process generally takes eight to twelve weeks.
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. In accordance with the new guidance, we applied the adoption prospectively from the beginning of fiscal year 2010. There was no significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon implementation and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future reporting periods based on our current practices. The new accounting guidance impacts the determination of when the individual elements included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified elements by requiring the use of the relative selling price method and no longer permitting the use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration. Additionally, the new accounting guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of estimated selling prices, or ESP,
 
 
of elements if the entity does not have vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or third-party evidence, or TPE, of a selling price. A selling price hierarchy must be followed in which an entity must first determine that it does not have VSOE or TPE before using ESP to allocate revenue to the elements in an arrangement.
For transactions that originated through October 2, 2009 and were not materially modified after that date, revenue was allocated to systems on a residual method basis. Under this method, the total value of the arrangement was allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their fair values, with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue. For transactions that originated or were materially modified after October 2, 2009, we use the relative selling price method. The total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on relative selling price as determined using the selling price hierarchy. We regularly review the method used to determine our relative selling price and update any estimates accordingly.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. The new accounting guidance amends the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted in the same period as the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, we adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue includes customer advances and amounts that have been billed pursuant to contractual terms but have not been recognized as revenue. We also defer the fair value of extended warranties bundled with equipment sales as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue for extended warranties is recognized ratably over the applicable warranty term, which generally is from 13 to 24 months from the date the customer accepts the products.
Evaluation Tools
We periodically supply evaluation tools to potential new customers, usually for a period of six months to one year. While the tool is at the customer's semiconductor manufacturing factory, or fab, we work closely with the customer on complex processes to qualify the tool for that particular customer's requirements. Until it is determined that a sale is probable, qualification costs are included in marketing, general and administrative expenses in the period incurred and we amortize the carrying value of the evaluation tool ratably over a period of typically four years. These costs are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expenses and the carrying value of the evaluation tool is included in inventory. Once it is determined a sale is probable, future qualification costs are added to the carrying value of the tool and the amortization of the carrying value is terminated. Customer evaluations are often successful and upon fulfillment of all four revenue recognition criteria, we recognize the revenue from the evaluation tool and remaining tool costs through revenue and cost of product revenue, respectively.
Stock-based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock-based awards exchanged for employee and director services is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
 
 
The choice of a valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique, involve significant judgments. These judgments reflect management's assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. Our judgments could change over time if the facts underlying these assumptions change, or as additional information becomes available. Any change in judgments could have a material impact on our financial statements. We believe that these estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non-traded stock options.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.
Short-term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All short-term investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value, which approximates cost, due to the short period of time to maturity and the relative risk of the investments. At fiscal year end 2010, we had the ability but not the intent to liquidate certain investments in order to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition have been classified as long-term.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Substantially all of our accounts receivable balance relates to trade receivables. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products and services. Accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded. The remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the amount of days the balance is past due and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
Inventory and Purchase Order Commitments
We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. On a quarterly basis, we assess the realizability of all inventories to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required. The determination of lower of cost or market requires that we make significant assumptions about future demand for products and the transition to new product offerings from legacy products. We also provide for losses on those open purchase order commitments in which our estimated obligation to receive inventory under the commitments exceeds expected production demand. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, supplier lead time and technological and market obsolescence. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis has been established, it is not written back up if demand increases.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed in the period the cost is incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated
 
 
useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is less. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are relieved from the accounts and resulting gains or losses are included in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets
As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, goodwill was $12.3 million. In accordance with the provisions of the goodwill accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized. We test for the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test for goodwill impairment at the consolidated level, as our subsidiaries do not constitute separate businesses and all possess similar economic characteristics. The test is performed by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities from the total estimated fair value to determine residual goodwill. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in each of the fiscal years ended 2010 and 2009 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, we review these assets for impairment. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of that asset, impairment exists. We recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is normally assessed using a discounted cash flow model. No impairment losses on long-lived assets were recognized in each of the fiscal years ended 2010 and 2009.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or supplier warranties on parts differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Environmental Liabilities
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. In situations where the various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate then future costs, the lower limit of an estimated range is accrued on a non-discounted basis. All other liabilities, where we have generally sufficient knowledge to estimate the scope of costs and future activities, are accrued on a discounted basis. Should new information become available and/or different assumptions are applied in the estimation of environmental liabilities, revisions to the accrued environmental liability would be required.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred
 
 
tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which the determination is made.
The accounting standard which provides guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The accounting standard for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets. As a result, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against currency exposures that are associated with certain of our assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies. The effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. We believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
All of our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Foreign Currency Translation
For international operations, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Nonmonetary assets such as inventories and property, plant, and equipment are translated at historical rates. Income and expense items are translated at effective rates of exchange prevailing during each year, except that inventories and depreciation charged to operations are translated at historical rates. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other expense, net.
 
 
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable, cash investments and forward foreign exchange contracts. In recent fiscal years, we have sold over half of our systems to our ten largest customers, and our trade accounts receivable is primarily comprised of these respective customers. However, the concentration of credit risk is limited as the customer base is dispersed among many geographic regions and is comprised primarily of large multinational companies. Furthermore, for some higher risk customers, we may require a letter of credit to reduce credit exposure. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral from our customers. As of October 1, 2010, four customers accounted for 12%, 11%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of the accounts receivable balance. As of October 2, 2009, two customers accounted for 23% and 21% of the accounts receivable balance.
In fiscal year 2010, revenue from two customers accounted for 23% and 13% of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2009, revenue from two customers accounted for 21% and 16% of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2008, revenue from two customers accounted for 16% and 13% of our total revenue.
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009 were $150.3 million and $164.5 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are invested with multiple financial institutions. Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury, government agency and corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value due to the short period of time to maturity and the relative risk of the investments. We manage our cash equivalents and investments as a single portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements. We also place forward foreign exchange contracts with investment grade financial institutions in order to minimize currency risk exposure.
We obtain some of the components and subassemblies that are included in our products from a limited group of suppliers, or in some cases a single source supplier. The loss of any supplier, including any single source supplier, would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers and may also require devoting significant resources to product development to incorporate new parts from other sources into our products. The need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause delays in delivery or significantly increase our costs. Although we have insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources, we cannot provide assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that it will remain available on commercially acceptable terms. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers, disruption or loss of these sources could negatively impact our business and damage customer relationships.
Research, Development and Engineering Costs
Research, development and engineering is comprised mainly of costs of internally-funded projects as well as continuing product development support. Costs incurred generally consist of employee and material costs, depreciation of equipment and other engineering related expenses. Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance states that the reporting entity should disclose separately
 
 
information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. We do not expect this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Fair Value
In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. The framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for the delay of the effective date for one year of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities on October 4, 2008, but elected a partial deferral under the provision related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when it was applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements when it was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The accounting standard for fair value measurements specifies a hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels are defined as follows:
 
 
 
This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. We maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. Further, we used internal sources and considered external sources to assist us in valuing certain instruments.
 
 
Determination of Fair Value
We measure fair value utilizing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The following is a description of valuation methodologies we used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy.
Cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents such as Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities of those financial assets.
Securities available-for-sale
Equity securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy, where quoted prices are available in an active market. We may utilize an alternative pricing method (for example, matrix pricing) and quotations from bond dealers to assist in determining fair value for each security traded over-the-counter rather than on a securities exchange. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions or by reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, to determine fair value. Securities priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2 and typically include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds.
Deferred compensation
The deferred compensation liability represents our obligation to pay benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The related investments, held in a Rabbi Trust, consist of equity securities, primarily mutual funds, and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Realized gains (losses) to fair value of both the equity securities and the related deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in marketing, general and administrative expense.
Derivatives
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in an active market for derivative assets and liabilities, which are traded on exchanges. These derivative assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
 
 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
 
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, the portfolio of financial assets excludes $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of minority equity investments in four and two private companies, respectively, which are accounted for under the cost method and are outside the scope of the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements. These equity investments are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
Note 4. Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
 
 
The estimated fair value of our stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards' vesting period. The effect of recording stock-based compensation for fiscal years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:
 
We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. Our expected term is calculated using historical data and assumes that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vest date and the full contractual term and is further adjusted for demographic data. We interpolate the risk-free interest rate from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond that coincides with the expected term. We do not have a history of paying dividends, nor do we expect to in the future. In fiscal year 2009, we determined that a blended volatility, using exclusively our historical and implied volatility measures, best reflects expected volatility over the expected term of the option. Prior to fiscal year 2009, we relied on a blended volatility, using our historical and implied volatility measures, and a peer group implied volatility. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
The fair value of each option granted during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
Stock Incentive Plan
The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, or the Plan, which replaced the Amended and Restated Omnibus Stock Plan upon shareholder approval on February 9, 2006, provides for the grant of non-qualified share-based awards to our eligible employees, consultants and non-employee directors. As of October 1, 2010, a total of 4,436,484 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Plan.
 
 
Stock option awards granted under the Plan generally have a life no longer than eight years after the date of the grant and generally vest as to 25% one year from date of grant with the remaining 75% vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments so that all options are vested at the end of four years. We normally settle employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. Restricted stock awards are granted under the Plan at $0.01 per share and generally vest as to 25% one year from the date of grant with the remaining 75% vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments.
Stock compensation expense associated with restricted common stock and restricted stock units is charged for the difference between the market value on the date of grant and the issuance price, less estimated forfeitures, and is amortized over the awards' vesting period on a straight-line basis for all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method applies to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
The following table summarizes the stock option and restricted stock activity for fiscal year 2010:
 
The total intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $28.90 as of the last day of fiscal year 2010 and represents the amounts that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.
As of October 1, 2010, the unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $15.8 million and $19.7 million, respectively. These amounts will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years and 2.9 years, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $12.7 million, $4.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, with intrinsic value defined as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date strike price. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these options in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16.3 million, $6.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $3.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11.8 million, $9.4 million and $16.9 million, respectively.
 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our employees, who elect to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, are able to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts six months. On November 24, 2008, we decided to suspend enrollment and participation in the ESPP from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, there were a total of 828,266 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under the ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
Note 5.    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009 were $150.3 million and $164.5 million, respectively.
Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The cost of securities sold was determined based on the specific identification method. Investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition have been classified as long-term.
Net realized losses on investments for fiscal year 2010 were approximately $0.1 million. Net realized losses on investments for fiscal year 2009 were approximately $0.5 million. Net realized gains on investments for fiscal year 2008 were approximately $0.4 million. As of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, net unrealized gains on investments of $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were recorded as other comprehensive income.
We determined that the unrealized losses at as of October 1, 2010, as aggregated by security type in the table below, are temporary. This assessment is based upon the nature of the investments and the causes of the unrealized losses. The investments are in corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as stated in the investment policy. The unrealized losses relate to the decline in fair value due to differences between the securities' interest rates at acquisition and current interest rates and the decline in credit worthiness of certain debtors.
 
 
Unrealized losses on investments as of October 1, 2010 by investment category and length of time the investment has been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 1, 2010 were as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 2, 2009 were as follows:
 
The investment maturities are as follows:
 
 
 
Note 6. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of the following:
 
Note 7.    Inventories
The components of inventories are as follows:
 
Note 8.    Property, Plant and Equipment
The components of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:
 
Depreciation expense was $15.9 million, $15.6 million and $17.1 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no capital leases in fiscal years 2010 or 2009.
Note 9.    Notes Payable
On May 23, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with multiple financial institutions providing for borrowings of a maximum principal amount of up to $100.0 million under an unsecured revolving credit facility. Amounts could be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time during the five year commitment period ending May 23, 2013. Borrowings would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either: (1) the greater of (a) the prime rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; or (2) the sum of (a) LIBOR, with certain adjustments and (b) an "applicable rate," defined in the credit agreement as a percentage spread based on our
 
 
leverage ratio. The credit agreement contained events of default and covenants. The credit facility was intended to provide ongoing working capital and cash for acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We terminated this credit agreement effective March 27, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement.
Our subsidiary in Japan had one credit facility during fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Maximum available borrowing under the facility was Yen 400,000,000 ($4.8 million) at fiscal year end 2010. The loan is not collateralized and contains no restrictive covenants, although the loan is guaranteed by us. The interest rate for the facility is the 3-month Tokyo interbank offered rate (TIBOR) plus 1.00%, which was approximately 1.4% and 1.6% as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings as of October 1, 2010 and as of October 2, 2009 under this facility. Our subsidiary in Japan also had an additional credit facility during fiscal year 2009, which was terminated in that year.
Our subsidiary in Taiwan terminated their credit facility of $1.0 million during fiscal year 2009. Any outstanding U.S. Dollar borrowings under the Taiwan facility accrued interest at the local base rate plus 2.0% plus taxes.
Our subsidiary in Europe maintains a credit facility that includes overdraft protection of Euro 2.5 million which at October 1, 2010 translated to $3.4 million. Interest accrues at the Euro base rate plus 1.5% and was approximately 6.1% and 6.4% at October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. Borrowings under this facility are payable on demand. The credit facility is not collateralized nor does it contain any restrictive covenants, although the facility is guaranteed by us. There were no outstanding borrowings as of October 1, 2010 and as of October 2, 2009 under this facility.
Note 10.    Accrued Expenses
The components of accrued expenses are as follows:
 
Note 11.    Restructuring
The semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic downturns and we have historically recorded restructuring charges in connection with cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the industry downturns. Restructuring charges typically consist of severance, benefits and outplacement services offered to terminated employees and sometimes include charges for remaining lease payments on facilities that are closed. Prior to any restructuring announcements, the restructuring is approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the reduction in force.
We began relocating our European operations in Houten, the Netherlands to Schaffhausen, Switzerland, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. The restructuring charge is comprised primarily of one-time termination benefits,
 
 
and contract termination expense related to a facility lease. European restructuring activity is significantly complete. The recognized cost of the European restructuring activity from the date of its commencement to October 1, 2010 is $2.5 million.
Exclusive of cash outlays of $0.7 million related to severance and contract termination costs to exit the Houten facility, there was no significant restructuring activity during fiscal year 2010. Cash outlays related to contract termination costs to exit the Houten facility will continue through fiscal year 2014.
The following table summarizes the restructuring activity for fiscal years 2009 and 2008.
 
Note 12.    Product Warranties
We warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and will conform to our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery for a period of three to twelve months from the date the customer accepts the products. Additionally, we warrant that maintenance services will be performed in a workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for a period of 90 days from the completion of any agreed-upon services. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. Our warranty obligation is affected by a number of factors, including product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should these factors or other factors affecting warranty costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Product warranty activity for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was as follows:
 
 
 
The components of product warranty liability are as follows:
 
Note 13.    Deferred Revenue
The components of deferred revenue are as follows:
 
Note 14.    Long-term Accrued Expenses and Other Long-term Liabilities
There were $80.2 million and $66.3 million in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, respectively. Included in these amounts were $55.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, for long-term tax liabilities. In addition, post-employment liabilities, environmental and other costs not expected to be expended within the next year were included in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The current portion was recorded within accrued expenses.
Note 15.    Long-term Debt
In February 2003, we purchased our previously leased facility located in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The purchase price consisted of cash payments totaling $3.4 million, the assumption of the seller's outstanding loan of $5.1 million and the transfer of other prepaid assets of $0.8 million. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 9.05% with monthly payments of principal and interest until the loan matures in January 2013. The $1.6 million carrying amount of the loan had an estimated fair value of $1.7 million as of October 1, 2010. The fair value of the loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The interest rate was estimated based on current market conditions and our financial condition as of October 1, 2010.
 
 
The loan payments are as follows:
 
Note 16.    Derivative Financial Instruments
Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exposure that is associated with certain of our revenues, assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies.
We hedge our exposure in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts. Since these derivatives hedge existing exposures that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on non-U.S. dollar forecasted revenue transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. We do not engage in currency speculation. For purposes of presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows, derivative gains and losses are presented within net cash provided by operating activities.
Cash flow hedges
A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures on forecasted non-U.S dollar denominated sales transactions. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. These derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the gain or loss from the derivative is reclassified from other comprehensive (loss) income to the consolidated statements of operations, in the related revenue caption, as appropriate. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized immediately in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-designated hedges
Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these outstanding non-designated derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.

Forward Exchange Contracts
As a multinational company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as our business practices evolve and could impact our financial results. We use derivative instruments to protect our foreign operations from fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. We hedge our current exposures and a portion of our anticipated foreign currency exposures with foreign currency forward contracts having terms of up to twelve months.
We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in the exchange rates. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Historically, our primary exposures have resulted from non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and purchases in Asia Pacific and Europe. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We hedge currency exposures that are associated with certain of our assets and liabilities denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies. Net foreign exchange losses for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Our international sales, except for those in Japan, are primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar. For foreign currency-denominated sales, however, the volatility of the foreign currency markets represents risk to us. Upon forecasting the exposure, we enter into hedges with forward sales contracts whose critical terms are designed to match those of the underlying exposure. These hedges are evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly using the change in value of the forward contracts to the change in value of the underlying transaction, with the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in other comprehensive income. Any measured ineffectiveness is included immediately in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There was an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness recognized during fiscal years 2010 and 2009.
 
 
The table below presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates), the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and the estimated fair value of our contracts outstanding as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009.
 
Note 17.    Income Taxes
The provisions for income taxes are as follows:
 
 
 
Total pre-tax income (loss) consists of the following:
 
The effective tax rate on pre-tax income differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the following:
 
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately $155 million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2010. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
 
 
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Deferred tax assets include gross state tax credit carryforwards of $20.5 million, $19.5 million and $17.0 million at fiscal year end 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These credits begin to expire in fiscal year 2018. Net operating losses included in deferred tax assets begin to expire in 2014.
We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate both the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income, ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the ability to utilize tax losses and credits in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance related to certain state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards has been recorded. Although, due to the global reorganization, we have increased our utilization of state tax credits, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of these credits will not be utilized, since historically the annual amount of state credits generated exceeds the amount of credits that can be used. We record a benefit to the tax provision and corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance related to the utilization of state tax credits generated in prior years. Should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our other deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be required resulting in an expense recorded within the provision for income taxes in the statement of income in the period in which such determination was made. It is possible that the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the near term, if our forecast of future taxable income is reduced. Our effective tax rate is affected by levels of taxable income in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions, U.S. tax credits generated and utilized for research and development expenditures, U.S. foreign income exclusion, investment tax credits and other tax incentives specific to domestic and foreign operations.
We benefit from tax incentives on approved investments in Singapore and Switzerland. The Singapore tax incentive expired on September 30, 2010. The Switzerland tax incentives are for periods ranging from five to ten years and are scheduled to expire within three to seven years. As a result of the tax holidays, our net income was higher by $14.6 million ($0.20 per share), lower by $0.9 million ($0.01 per share) and higher by $2.4 million
 
 
($0.03 per share) for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The benefit of losses incurred in Switzerland in fiscal year 2009 at a reduced rate resulted in an overall negative impact of the tax holidays to the consolidated financial statements in that year. We do not expect the expiration of the Singapore incentive to have a material effect on the tax rate in the future.
In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, tax deductions associated with certain exercises of stock options, activity related to our ESPP and vesting of certain restricted stock shares resulted in a tax benefit recorded to capital in excess of par value of $3.3 million, $0.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. We have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, extraterritorial income deduction and qualified production deduction through the statement of operations rather than through paid-in-capital.
The aggregate changes in the balances of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
 
The net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal year 2010 was $7.6 million for positions taken in the current year. Of the $62.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $60.9 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective rate consists of items that are offset by deferred tax assets, relating to state tax credits which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, we accrued $5.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The statute of limitations for our tax filings with federal, state and foreign tax authorities is generally open for fiscal years 2003 through the present. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, commenced an examination of fiscal year 2007 in December of 2008. The IRS completed examinations of certain refund claims filed for fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and we filed a protest of the refund claim audit findings with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The IRS audit of fiscal year 2007 is continuing and has been extended to include fiscal year 2009. It is unknown whether agreement on the refund claims or resolution of the IRS audit of fiscal years 2007 and 2009 will be reached within the next twelve months. The favorable resolution of the claims filed with the Appeals Office could result in a benefit to the tax provision of up to $5.8 million, excluding interest. Based on the status of the IRS audit, it is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of any changes to our previously recorded uncertain tax positions. It is possible that up to $26.8 million of unrecognized tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, may be recognized within one year as the result of the lapse of statutes of limitations.
 
 
Note 18.    Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and participating unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes additional dilution from stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and non-participating unvested restricted stock. Options to purchase common shares with exercise prices that exceeded the market value of the underlying common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For purposes of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation, the additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options are determined using the treasury stock method, which includes share-based compensation expense as assumed proceeds and the tax effect of such compensation.
The calculation of assumed proceeds, used to determine diluted weighted average shares outstanding under the treasury stock method is adjusted by tax windfalls and shortfalls associated with outstanding stock awards. Windfalls and shortfalls are computed by comparing the tax deductible amount of outstanding stock awards to their grant date fair values and multiplying the result by the applicable statutory tax rate. A positive result creates a windfall, which increases the assumed proceeds and a negative result creates a shortfall, which reduces the assumed proceeds.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and, therefore, should be included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participating rights in undistributed earnings. Our restricted stock awards granted to employees are considered participating securities as they receive rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stockholders and thus are included in computing our earnings per share. The effect of this adoption impacted both previously reported basic and diluted net loss per share by $0.01 for fiscal year 2009, and basic and diluted net income per share by $(0.02) and $(0.01), respectively, for fiscal year 2008.
A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the net income (loss) per share calculations is presented as follows:
 
 
 
Stock options to purchase the following number of shares of common stock were not included in our calculations of diluted earnings per share, as the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive:
 
Note 19.    Share Repurchase Plan
In October 2004, our board of directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to $100.0 million of our common stock on the open market. Subsequently, our board of directors voted to increase to the amount of funds that may be expended in repurchasing our common stock to a total of $800.0 million. The program does not have a fixed expiration date. As of fiscal year end 2010, approximately $67.7 million remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization.
We repurchased the following shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan:
 
We repurchased an additional 421,385 shares for a total cost of $12.8 million between October 2, 2010 and November 15, 2010, the latest practicable date prior to the filing date of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Note 20.    Retirement Plans
We have a defined contribution retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Generally, we make a guaranteed contribution, and in some years a discretionary contribution, to each participant's account, typically based on fiscal year earnings achievement and calculated as a percentage of the participant's base pay. Participants are entitled, upon termination or retirement, to their portion of the retirement fund assets, which are held by a third-party custodian. Through fiscal year 2010, we had two subsidiary-sponsored defined benefit pension plans. In late fiscal year 2010, one of these plans was terminated and replaced by a defined contribution plan. The obligation related to this plan was settled by either cash payments to employees or transfers of assets to third party investment accounts as designated by the employee.
In connection with the spin-off from Varian Associates, Inc, we have defined benefit retirement plan liabilities. This plan is administered by Varian Medical Systems, Inc, or VMS. We reimburse VMS for shared costs related to this plan.
Our liabilities related to pension and other post-retirement benefits were $7.4 million and $8.6 million as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively. In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, our retirement benefit expense was $5.2 million, $2.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Our defined contribution retirement plan operates on a calendar year basis. Corporate contributions were suspended from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 due to cost reduction efforts in response to the industry downturn.
 
 
Note 21.    Lease Commitments
We lease various types of warehouse and office facilities and equipment, furniture and fixtures under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:
 
Rental expense was $2.9 million in fiscal year 2010. In both fiscal years 2009 and 2008 rental expense was $3.1 million, respectively.
Note 22.    Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity at our request. The term of the indemnification period is upon the later of (i) ten years after the person has ceased being an officer or director, or (ii) the termination of all pending or threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We enter into indemnification agreements in the normal course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our customers, in connection with any patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products. We generally seek to limit liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products subject to the indemnification obligations. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited. Based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We also indemnify certain customers with respect to damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental claims related to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, officers, authorized agents or subcontractors. We have general and umbrella insurance policies that limit our exposure under these indemnification obligations and guarantees. As a result of our insurance policy coverage and based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2010 and October 2, 2009, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
 
 
Prior to the spin-off of Varian Semiconductor from Varian Associates, Inc., or VAI, Varian Semiconductor's business was operated as the Semiconductor Equipment Business, or SEB, of VAI. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, its Instruments Business to Varian, Inc., or VI, and changed its name to Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or VMS. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. In connection with the spin-off from VAI, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI entered into certain agreements which include a Distribution Agreement, an Employee Benefits Allocation Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, and a Transition Services Agreement, (collectively, the Distribution Related Agreements) whereby Varian Semiconductor agreed to indemnify VMS and VI for any costs, liabilities or expenses relating to Varian Semiconductor's legal proceedings. Under the Distribution Related Agreements, Varian Semiconductor has agreed to reimburse VMS for one-third of the costs, liabilities, and expenses, adjusted for any related tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS, with respect to certain legal proceedings relating to discontinued operations of VMS. We believe, difference between the estimated fair value of the indemnification agreements and the amounts recorded in our financial statements, is minimal.
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and/or local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These include laws regarding discharges into soil, water and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. In addition, several countries are reviewing proposed regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose of their products at the end of a product's useful life. These laws have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of certain operations.
We also enter into purchase order commitments in the normal course of business. As of fiscal year end 2010, we had $85.1 million of purchase order commitments with various suppliers. In addition, we maintain vendor liability agreements whereby product can be delivered within our lead time requirements. As of October 1, 2010, our maximum liability under these arrangements was approximately $30.0 million.
Environmental Remediation
VAI has been named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, at eight sites where VAI is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal. VAI is also involved in various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in consultation with, foreign, federal, state and/or local agencies at certain current or former VAI facilities (including facilities disposed of in connection with VAI's sale of its Electron Devices business during fiscal year 1995, and the sale of its Thin Film Systems business during fiscal year 1997). The Distribution Related Agreements provide that each of VMS, Varian Semiconductor and VI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of May 2010, will indemnify the others for one-third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs, as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs.
For certain of these sites and facilities, various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken. Per the estimates provided by VMS, we have accrued $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009. As to other sites and facilities, sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to reasonably estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities. As such, we have accrued $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, which represents future costs discounted at 7%, net of inflation, to cover our portion of these costs. This reserve is in addition to the $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, as previously described.
 
 
As of fiscal year end 2010, our environmental liability, based upon future environmental-related costs estimated by VMS as of that date and included in current and long-term accrued expenses, is calculated as follows:
 
As of fiscal year end 2010, the current portion of the reserve is $0.7 million and the long-term portion of the reserve is $4.0 million, which is included in long-term accrued expenses. The difference of $0.2 million between the total anticipated future costs and the amounts recognized on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end 2010 is attributable to the pay down of the obligation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
The amounts set forth in the foregoing table are only estimates of anticipated future environmental-related costs and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates. The aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation and remediation activities and the large number of sites where VMS is undertaking such investigation and remediation activities. VMS believes that most of these cost ranges will narrow as investigation and remediation activities progress. We believe our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of the obligations become more clearly defined, these reserves may be modified and related charges against income may be made.
Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available to management and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, our management believes that the costs of these environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our liability for environmental-related investigation and remediation in light of the liability and financial wherewithal of potentially responsible parties and insurance companies where we believe that we have rights to contribution, indemnity and/or reimbursement. Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already incurred, and to be incurred in the future, have been asserted against various insurance companies and other third parties. In 1992, VAI filed a lawsuit against 36 insurance companies with respect to most of the above-referenced sites and facilities. VAI received certain cash settlements with respect to these lawsuits in prior years. VMS has also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures. Although VMS intends to aggressively pursue additional insurance recoveries, we have not reduced any liability in anticipation of recovery with respect to claims made against third parties.
 
 
Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to legal disputes. While we believe we have meritorious claims and/or defenses with respect to each dispute, the outcomes are not determinable. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these disputes, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.
Note 23.    Other Transactions with Affiliates
Operations prior to April 2, 1999 had been part of the former VAI, which now operates as VMS. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, then distributed to the holders of record of VAI common stock one share of common stock of Varian Semiconductor for each share of VAI common stock owned on March 24, 1999. At the same time, VAI contributed its Instruments Business, or IB, to VI and distributed to the holders of record of VAI common stock one share of common stock of IB for each share of VAI common stock owned on March 24, 1999. VAI retained its Health Care Systems business and changed its name to VMS effective as of April 2, 1999. These transactions were accomplished under the terms of a Distribution Agreement by and among Varian Semiconductor, VAI, hereafter referred to as VMS for periods following the spin-off and VI, or the Distribution Agreement. For purposes of providing an orderly transition and to define certain ongoing relationships between and among Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI after the spin-off, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI also entered into the Distribution Related Agreements. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc.
The Distribution Related Agreements provide that from and after the spin-off, VMS, VI and Varian Semiconductor will indemnify each and their respective subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents against all losses arising in connection with shared liabilities (including certain environmental and legal liabilities). All shared liabilities will be managed and administered by VMS and expenses and losses, net of proceeds and other receivables, will be borne one-third each by VMS, VI, and Varian Semiconductor. The Distribution Related Agreements also provide that we shall assume all of our liabilities, other than shared liabilities (including accounts payable, accrued payroll and pension liabilities) in accordance with their terms. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we were charged $1.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, by VMS in settlement of these obligations.
Note 24.    Operating Segments and Geographic Information
We have determined that we operate in one business segment: the manufacturing, marketing and servicing of semiconductor processing equipment for ion implantation systems. Since we operate in one segment, all financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue from our ten largest customers in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 accounted for approximately 80%, 73% and 74% of total revenue, respectively. In fiscal year 2010, revenue from tsmc and Samsung accounted for 23% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2009, revenue from Intel and tsmc accounted for 21% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2008, revenue from Samsung and Intel accounted for 16% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue.
Sales to Asia Pacific accounted for 78%, 63% and 70% of revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our North American sales accounted for 15%, 28% and 22% of total revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. European sales accounted for 8%, 9% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively.
 
 
The following table summarizes revenue for the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 based on final destination and long-lived assets as of fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 by geography:

Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of Business
Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian Semiconductor," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits to customers located both in the United States, or U.S., and in international markets.
On May 3, 2011, the Company entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied"), under which Applied agreed to acquire Varian for $63 per share in cash for a total price of approximately $4.9 billion on a fully-diluted basis ("the Merger"). The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Varian's shareholders and review by U.S. and international regulators. At the completion of the merger, the Company would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010 filed with the SEC on November 22, 2010. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the information required to be set forth therein. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year or for any other period.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Recently Adopted Changes in Accounting Principles
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This guidance also requires a gross presentation of activity related to Level 3 fair value measurements, presenting separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. This guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 fair value measurements, which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting periods within those years. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 except for the guidance related to the gross presentation of Level 3 fair value measurements, which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The new accounting guidance impacts the determination of when the individual elements included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified elements by requiring the use of the relative selling price method and no longer permitting the use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration. Additionally, the new accounting guidance modifies the fair value requirements by allowing the use of estimated selling prices, or ESP, of elements if the entity does not have vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or third-party evidence, or TPE, of a selling price. A selling price hierarchy must be followed in which an entity must first determine that it does not have VSOE or TPE before using ESP to allocate revenue to the elements in an arrangement. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year
 
2010. In accordance with the new guidance, we applied the adoption prospectively from the beginning of fiscal year 2010. There was no significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon implementation and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future reporting periods based on our current practices.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. The new accounting guidance amends the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted in the same period as the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, we adopted the new accounting guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for the delay of the effective date for one year of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities on October 4, 2008, but elected a partial deferral under the provision related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. We adopted the guidance related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 2. Fair Value
Fair Value Hierarchy
The accounting standards codification for fair value measurements specifies a hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels are defined as follows:
 
 
 
This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. We maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. Further, we used internal sources and considered external sources to assist us in valuing certain instruments.
Determination of Fair Value
We measure fair value utilizing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The following is a description of valuation methodologies we used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy.
Cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents such as Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities of those financial assets.
 
Securities available-for-sale
Equity securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy, where quoted prices are available in an active market. We may utilize an alternative pricing method (for example, matrix pricing) and quotations from bond dealers to assist in determining fair value for each security traded over-the-counter rather than on a securities exchange. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions or by reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, to determine fair value. Securities priced using such methods are classified as Level 2 and include U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds.
Deferred compensation
The deferred compensation liability represents our obligation to pay benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The related investments, held in a Rabbi Trust, consist of equity securities, primarily mutual funds, and are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Realized gains and losses to fair value of both the equity securities and the related deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in marketing, general and administrative expense.
Derivatives
We use quoted prices in an active market for derivative assets and liabilities, which are traded on exchanges. These derivative assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
 
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
As of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, the portfolio of financial assets excludes $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of investments in equity in four private companies. Three of these investments are accounted for under the cost method and the remaining investment is accounted for under the equity method. All of these investments are outside the scope of the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements. These equity investments are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
Note 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate estimated fair value because of the short-term maturities of those financial instruments. Cash equivalents as of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010 were $277.9 million and $150.3 million, respectively.
Investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate bonds. All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The cost of securities sold was determined based on the specific identification method. Investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the respective balance sheet date are classified as long-term.
Net realized gains on investments for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011 were less than $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended July 2, 2010 were $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, net unrealized gains on investments of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, were recorded as other comprehensive income.
We determined that the unrealized losses as of July 1, 2011, as aggregated by security type in the table below, are temporary. This assessment is based upon the nature of the investments and the causes of the unrealized losses. The investments are in corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and municipal bonds as stated in the investment policy. The unrealized losses relate to the decline in fair value due to differences between the securities' interest rates at acquisition and current interest rates and the decline in credit worthiness of certain debtors.
 
Unrealized losses on investments as of July 1, 2011 by investment category and length of time the investment has been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of July 1, 2011 were as follows:
 
Investments by security type as of October 1, 2010 were as follows:
 
The investment maturities are as follows:
 
 
 
Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date and is based on the fair value of the award. The straight-line method is applied to all grants with service conditions, while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions.
The estimated fair value of our stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the vesting period of the respective award. The effect of recording stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010 are as follows:
 
We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. Our expected term is calculated using historical data and assumes that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vest date and the full contractual term and is further adjusted for demographic data. We interpolate the risk-free interest rate from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond that coincides with the expected term. We do not have a history of paying dividends, nor do we expect to in the future. We use a blended volatility, using our historical and implied volatility measures. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
 
The following table summarizes stock option and restricted stock activity as of and for the nine months ended July 1, of fiscal year 2011:
 
As of July 1, 2011, there were a total of 3,056,633 shares reserved for issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The aggregate intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $61.57 on July 1, 2011, and represents the amounts that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. Intrinsic value is defined as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date price.
As of July 1, 2011, the unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $9.8 million and $32.3 million, respectively. These amounts will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 1.9 years and 3.1 years, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine month periods ended July 1, 2011, was $58.7 million and $95.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2010, was $3.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively.
The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and nine month periods ended July 1, 2011, was $3.0 million and $12.8 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2010, was $2.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our employees who elect to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, are able to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period. Each offering period lasts six months. On November 24, 2008, we decided to suspend enrollment and participation in the ESPP as of January 1, 2009 due to efforts to reduce equity compensation expense. We lifted the suspension on January 1, 2011. During the nine months ended July 1, 2011, there were 59,245 shares purchased under the ESPP. As of July 1, 2011, there were a total of 769,021 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under the ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
 
Note 5. Computation of Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and participating unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share includes additional dilution from stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and non-participating unvested restricted stock. Options to purchase common shares with exercise prices that exceeded the market value of the underlying common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For purposes of the diluted net income per share calculation, the additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options are determined using the treasury stock method, which includes as assumed proceeds, share-based compensation expense and the tax effect of such compensation.
The calculation of assumed proceeds, used to determine diluted weighted average shares outstanding under the treasury stock method is adjusted by tax windfalls and shortfalls associated with outstanding stock awards. Windfalls and shortfalls are computed by comparing the tax deductible amount of outstanding stock awards to their grant date fair values and multiplying the result by the applicable statutory tax rate. A positive result creates a windfall, which increases the assumed proceeds and a negative result creates a shortfall, which reduces the assumed proceeds.
A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the net income per share calculations is presented as follows:
 
For the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011, 0.1 million and 0.2 million potentially dilutive shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended July 2, 2010, 2.0 million and 1.9 million potentially dilutive shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
Note 6. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of the following:
 
 
Note 7. Inventories
The components of inventories are as follows:
 
Note 8. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
The components of accrued expenses and other current liabilities are as follows:
 
Note 9. Long-Term Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities
There were $73.8 million and $81.1 million in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities at July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, respectively. Included in these amounts were $44.2 million and $55.2 million, respectively, for long-term tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions (see Note 16. "Income Taxes"). In addition, product warranty liabilities, post-employment liabilities, environmental and other costs which are not expected to be expended within the next year are included in long-term accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The current portion is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Note 10. Product Warranties
We warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and will conform to our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery for a period of three to twelve months from the date the customer accepts the products. Additionally, we warrant that maintenance services will be performed in a workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for a period of 90 days from the completion of any agreed-upon services. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties, the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information, at the time product revenue is recognized. Our warranty obligation is affected by a number of factors, including product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to us. Should these factors or other factors affecting warranty costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Product warranty activity for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010 was as follows:
 
 
The components of product warranty liability are as follows:
 
Note 11. Deferred Revenue
The components of deferred revenue are as follows:
 
Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity at our request. The term of the indemnification period is upon the later of (i) ten years after the person has ceased being an officer or director, or (ii) the termination of all pending or threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We enter into indemnification agreements in the normal course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, such as our customers or partners, in connection with any patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products. We seek to limit liability for such indemnity, for example to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products subject to the indemnification obligations. The term of these indemnification agreements may
 
vary, although in many instances, is perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited. Based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
We also indemnify certain customers with respect to damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental claims related to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, officers, authorized agents or subcontractors. We have general and umbrella insurance policies that limit our exposure under these indemnification obligations and guarantees. As a result of our insurance policy coverage and based on information available, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements.
Prior to the spin-off of Varian Semiconductor from Varian Associates, Inc., or VAI, Varian Semiconductor's business was operated as the Semiconductor Equipment Business, or SEB, of VAI. On April 2, 1999, VAI contributed its SEB to Varian Semiconductor, its Instruments Business to Varian, Inc., or VI, and changed its name to Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or VMS. In May 2010, VI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. In connection with the spin-off from VAI, Varian Semiconductor, VMS and VI entered into certain agreements which include a Distribution Agreement, an Employee Benefits Allocation Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, and a Transition Services Agreement, (collectively, the Distribution Related Agreements) whereby Varian Semiconductor agreed to indemnify VMS and VI for any costs, liabilities or expenses relating to Varian Semiconductor's legal proceedings. Under the Distribution Related Agreements, Varian Semiconductor has agreed to reimburse VMS for one-third of the costs, liabilities, and expenses, adjusted for any related tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS, with respect to certain legal proceedings relating to discontinued operations of VMS. We believe, the difference between the estimated fair value of the indemnification agreements and the amounts recorded in our financial statements, is minimal.
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and/or local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These include laws regarding discharges into soil, water and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. In addition, several countries are reviewing proposed regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose of their products at the end of a product's useful life. These laws have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of certain operations.
We also enter into purchase order commitments in the normal course of business. As of July 1, 2011, we had $86.3 million of purchase order commitments with various suppliers. In addition, we maintain vendor liability agreements whereby product can be delivered within our lead time requirements. As of July 1, 2011, our maximum liability under these arrangements was approximately $41.0 million.
Environmental Remediation
VAI has been named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, at eight sites where VAI is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal. VAI is also involved in various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in consultation with, foreign, federal, state and/or local agencies at certain current or former VAI facilities (including facilities disposed of in connection with VAI's sale of its Electron Devices business during fiscal year 1995, and the sale of its Thin Film Systems business during fiscal year 1997). The Distribution Related Agreements provide that each of VMS, Varian Semiconductor and VI will indemnify the others for one-third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs, as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs.
For certain of these sites and facilities, various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken. Per the estimates provided by VMS, we have accrued $0.8 million in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities as of July 1, 2011. As to other sites and facilities, sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to reasonably estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities. As such, we have accrued $3.8 million as of July 1, 2011, which represents future costs discounted at 4%, net of inflation, to cover our portion of these costs. This reserve is in addition to the $0.8 million as of July 1, 2011, as previously described.
 
As of July 1, 2011, our environmental liability, based upon future environmental-related costs estimated by VMS as of that date and included in current and long-term accrued expenses, totaled $4.6 million, of which $0.7 million is classified as current.
The amounts set forth in the foregoing paragraph are only estimates of anticipated future environmental-related costs, and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates. The aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation and remediation activities and the large number of sites where VMS is undertaking such investigation and remediation activities. VMS believes that most of these cost ranges will narrow as investigation and remediation activities progress. We believe that our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of the obligations become more clearly defined, these reserves may be modified and related charges against income may be made.
Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available to management and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, our management believes that the costs of these environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our liability for environmental-related investigation and remediation in light of the liability and financial strength of potentially responsible parties and insurance companies where we believe that we have rights to contribution, indemnity and/or reimbursement. Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already incurred, and to be incurred in the future, have been asserted against various insurance companies and other third parties. VMS receives certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants, its insurers and other third parties from time to time. VMS has also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures. Accordingly, we have recorded a receivable for approximately $1.1 million at each of July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2010 which was included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding, written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has, in the past, paid the claims that VMS has made.
Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to legal disputes. While we believe we have meritorious claims and/or defenses with respect to each dispute, we cannot predict the outcome of each such dispute. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these disputes, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.
See Note 17. "Subsequent Event".
 
Note 13. Comprehensive Income
The following table reconciles net income to comprehensive income, net of tax effect, for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010:
 
Note 14. Share Repurchase Plan
Our board of directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to $900.0 million of our common stock on the open market. The program does not have a fixed expiration date. As of July 1, 2011, approximately $115.7 million remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization.
We repurchased the following shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan during the three and nine months ended July 1, 2011:
 
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three and nine month periods ended July 1, 2010.
We did not repurchase any additional shares between July 1, 2011 and July 22, 2011, the latest practicable date prior to the filing date of this report.
Note 15. Operating Segments and Geographic Information
We have determined that we operate in one business segment: the manufacturing, marketing and servicing of semiconductor processing equipment for ion implantation systems. Since we operate in one segment, all financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
We expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue in the foreseeable future. For the three months ended July 1, 2011, revenue from two customers accounted for 27% and 12% of our total revenue. For the three months ended July 2, 2010, revenue from two customers accounted for 24% and 14% of our total revenue. During the nine months ended July 1, 2011, revenue from two customers accounted for 27% and 12% of our total revenue. During the nine months ended July 2, 2010, revenue from two customers accounted for 27% and 14% of our total revenue.
As of July 1, 2011, three customers represented 20%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balance. As of October 1, 2010, four customers accounted for 12%, 11%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balance.
 
The following table summarizes revenue based on final geographic destination and long-lived assets by geography:
 
Note 16. Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on the tax laws and statutory rates applied to our expected annual earnings from operations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world.
Our income tax provision was $42.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 and $20.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010. Our tax rate was 16% and 17% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively including discrete items. Discrete charges for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 were $5.7 million and include an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions of $9.6 million and interest accrued on uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million offset by a benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and experimentation credit in the amount of $1.8 million, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 million due to the lapse of statutes of limitations, $0.6 million related to tax return adjustments, and other discrete items. The discrete income tax charge related to these items in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 increased the tax rate by approximately 2% for that period. Discrete net benefits for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 were $1.2 million and primarily relate to the release of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and tax return adjustments, offset by interest accrued on uncertain tax positions. The discrete income tax net benefit related to these items in the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 decreased the tax rate by approximately 1%.
The tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was less than the statutory tax rate of 35% due to income earned in low tax jurisdictions, the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and experimentation credit, and tax return adjustments offset by increases in tax reserves.
The net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits during the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was $7.9 million due to positions taken in the period offset by reserve releases. We also recorded an addition to reserves of $9.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 related to positions taken in prior periods. The tax reserves were increased for prior periods in connection with the tax audits of those years. Based on our recent discussions with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the amount of royalties paid on the transfer of intangibles and our acceptance of a range of settlement amounts related to those royalties, we are adjusting our estimate of tax reserves. The ultimate outcome of the tax audits remains subject to change.
As of July 1, 2011, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $80.1 million, of which $78.2 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective rate consists of items that are offset by deferred tax assets, relating to state tax credits which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. As of July 1, 2011, the total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $5.7 million. We will re-examine the tax provision and the effect of estimated unrecognized tax benefits on our financial position at the end of each reporting period. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The statute of limitations for our tax filings with federal, state and foreign tax authorities is open for fiscal years 2003 through the present. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, commenced an examination of fiscal year 2007 in December 2008. The IRS completed
 
examinations of certain refund claims filed for fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and we filed a protest of the refund claim audit findings with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The IRS audit of fiscal year 2007 is continuing and has been extended to include fiscal year 2009. It is possible that an agreement on the refund claims and a resolution of the IRS audit of fiscal years 2007 and 2009 will be reached within the next twelve months. The favorable resolution of the claims filed with the Appeals Office could result in a benefit to the tax provision of up to $5.8 million, excluding interest. Based on the status of the IRS audit, it is reasonably possible that a settlement could reduce reserves for uncertain tax positions in the range of $28 to $32 million, excluding interest and penalties, within the next twelve months. It is possible that up to $32.0 million of unrecognized tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, may be recognized within one year as the result of the lapse of statutes of limitations.
Note 17. Subsequent Event
On July 21, 2011, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a purported stockholder of the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the "LMPERS Action"). The complaint filed in the LMPERS Action names the Company, the members of the board of directors of the Company, Applied and Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied, as defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the pending merger with Applied (See Note 1. "Description of Business and Basis of Presentation") is the product of a flawed process and that the consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders in the merger is unfair and inadequate. The complaint further alleges, among other things, that the members of the Company's board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to maximize the value of the Company to its stockholders, taking actions designed to deter higher offers from other potential acquirers, and failing to disclose all material information that would permit the Company's stockholders to cast a fully informed vote on the merger. In addition, the complaint alleges that the Company and Applied aided and abetted the actions of the Company's board members in breaching their fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks, among other relief: (i) class certification; (ii) declaratory relief; (iii) an order rescinding the merger agreement; (iv) an injunction preventing consummation of the merger; (v) imposition of a constructive trust in favor of the plaintiff class; (vi) attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses; and (vii) such other relief as the courts might find just and proper.The Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the litigation. The Company cannot at this time reasonably estimate a range of exposure, if any, of the potential liability of this matter; however, we do not believe that the outcome of this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Part II. Item I  "Legal Proceedings."
We have evaluated this event, and any other subsequent events through the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC.
 

Exhibit 99.4
Introduction to unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
On November 10, 2011, Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Applied") completed its previously-announced acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("Varian"). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 3, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied ("Merger Sub") merged with and into Varian (the "Merger"), with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the effective date of the Merger had occurred on July 31, 2011. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010 and the nine months ended July 31, 2011 are presented as if the effective date of the Merger had occurred on October 26, 2009. This information should be read in conjunction with the:
 
 
 
 
 
Because Applied's third fiscal quarter ended on July 31, 2011 and Varian's third fiscal quarter ended on July 1, 2011, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical balances of Applied and Varian as of those dates, with pro forma adjustments. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations combine the historical results of Applied for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010 and for the nine months ended July 31, 2011, with the historical results of Varian for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2010 and the nine months ended July 1, 2011, respectively, with pro forma adjustments. No adjustments were made to either Applied's or Varian's reported information for the different period end dates.
The pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Merger had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Applied believes are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect 1) any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that the combined company may achieve as a result of the Merger; or 2) the costs to integrate the operations of Applied and Varian; or 3) the costs necessary to achieve any cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements.
The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated respective fair values. Applied management has determined the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the pro forma combined balance sheet date. The excess of the fair value of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the purchase price and the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the actual amounts recorded upon completion of our valuation work may differ materially from the information presented herein. A final determination of these estimated fair values will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Varian existing on November 10, 2011.
There were no intercompany transactions between Applied and Varian as of the dates and for the periods of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Applied and Varian and other financial information pertaining to Applied and Varian, including that set forth in the corresponding Applied management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors.
 
The accompanying notes to the pro forma adjustments included herein are an integral part of these statements.

The accompanying notes to the pro forma adjustments included herein are an integral part of these statements.
Basis of presentation
On November 10, 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into Varian, with Varian surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume the cash payment of $63.00 for each outstanding share of Varian common stock, excluding shares held by Varian or Applied. For the purposes of these pro forma financial statements, the total cash payment was $4.8 billion based on shares outstanding as of November 9, 2011. The cash payment includes (i) the conversion of each share of Varian common stock into the right to receive $63.00 per share, (ii) the cancellation of vested options granted under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Varian, as well as certain other options identified by Applied prior to the effective date of the Merger, and replacement with the right to receive $63.00 per share in cash, less the applicable option exercise price, and (iii) the cancellation of vested and unvested restricted stock units and replacement with the right to receive $63.00 per share in cash. All cash payments for equity awards are subject to applicable tax withholdings, if any.
In addition, on the effective date of the Merger, each vested option granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan of Varian that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective date, other than certain options identified by Applied, was converted into a fully vested option to purchase Applied common stock, either by Applied assuming that stock option or replacing it with a reasonably equivalent option to purchase Applied common stock based on a conversion ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. The estimated fair value of these converted options is $4.8 million and is included in the total Merger consideration.
At the effective date of the Merger, each unvested stock option, other than certain options identified by Applied, was converted into an option to purchase Applied common stock, effected by Applied either assuming that stock option or replacing it with a reasonably equivalent option to purchase Applied common stock based on a conversion ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. Applied converted options to purchase approximately 0.9 million shares of Varian common stock into options to purchase approximately 4.6 million shares of Applied common stock with an approximate value of $30.5 million. A portion of this amount, representing the options that are earned but not vested, will be attributable to Merger consideration. Based on unvested stock options outstanding at November 9, 2011, we estimate that this amount will be approximately $19.3 million. This portion of the earned options is included in the total Merger consideration. The amount not included in the purchase price will be recorded as compensation expense in the post-Merger combined Statement of Operations in the periods that the compensation is earned, which can be up to four years from the date of acquisition.
Each outstanding, unvested share of Varian restricted common stock that was subject to a risk of forfeiture, a repurchase option or other condition pursuant to an applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Varian was exchanged for a future cash payment based on the same per-share Merger consideration as other shares of Varian common stock. Based on the total number of shares of Varian unvested restricted common stock outstanding at the effective date, Applied will pay approximately $73.0 million in cash for the unvested outstanding shares of Varian restricted common stock. A portion of this amount, representing the shares that are earned but not vested, is included in the total Merger consideration. Based on unvested restricted common stock outstanding at the effective date, this amount is approximately $47.0 million. The amount not included in the purchase price will be recorded as compensation expense in the post-Merger combined Statement of Operations in the periods that the compensation is earned, which can be up to four years from the date of acquisition. The actual cash payment will be determined based on the actual number of unvested shares of Varian restricted common stock outstanding upon the completion of the Merger.
Employee equity-based compensation expense resulting from the assumption of unvested employee stock awards, combined with any additional expense resulting from the potential future offering of employee stock awards, if any, is expected to be materially consistent with the expense included in the Varian historical financials incorporated herein. Accordingly, no adjustments to employee equity-based compensation expense were made for the purposes of this pro forma presentation.
The total purchase price will be allocated to Varian's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date. For purposes of this presentation the Merger consideration has been allocated based on preliminary estimates of fair values that are described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The allocation of the Merger consideration, estimated useful lives and first year amortization and incremental depreciation associated with certain acquired assets are as follows (in millions):
 
A preliminary estimate of $962 million has been allocated to net tangible assets acquired and approximately $1,450 million has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The amortization related to the acquired amortizable intangible assets and additional depreciation resulting from the increase of tangible assets to fair value are included as pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
Intangible Assets
Developed technology relates to Varian's products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility. Developed technology represents a combination of Varian's processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of their products. Applied expects to amortize the fair value of the acquired product rights based on the anticipated time frame in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be recognized, which is assumed to be a straight-line amortization.
Significant Classes of Intangible Assets Acquired.
In-process research and development includes research and development for products that have not yet reached technological feasibility. Amortization of these amounts will begin at the time that the respective products reach technological feasibility. If a research and development project ends, the associated in-process research and development asset will be written down to zero in the period in which the project ends.
Customer contracts and relationships consist of preexisting relationships that are expected to contribute to future earnings. Trademarks and trade names include logos, product names, and other product and entity identifiers that are registered with a government agency. The fair value of these intangible assets is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the economic benefits will be recognized.
As of the effective date of the Merger, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value. These acquired assets could include assets that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, it is assumed that all assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those assets.
Valuation.
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ("HSR Act") and other relevant laws and regulations, there were significant limitations regarding what Applied was able to learn about the specifics of the Varian intangible assets prior to the completion of the Merger. This valuation effort is currently underway. Obtaining the necessary information to complete the valuation of such intangible assets could take several months. As a result, the final determination of the values of such intangible assets will likely differ from these preliminary valuations and the differences could be material.
. Approximately $2.5 billion has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that Applied's management determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, Applied will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
Goodwill
Pro forma adjustments
Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect (i) the purchase price; (ii) amounts related to Varian's net tangible and intangible assets at an amount equal to the preliminary estimates of their fair values; (iii) the amortization expense related to the estimated amortizable intangible assets; (iv) changes in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the preliminary estimated fair value adjustments to net tangible and intangible assets; and (v) the income tax effect related to the pro forma adjustments.
There were no intercompany balances and transactions between Applied and Varian as of the dates and for the periods of these pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
The pro forma combined provision for income taxes does not necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted had Applied and Varian filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include liabilities that may result from integration activities which are not presently estimable. Liabilities ultimately may be recorded for severance costs for employees, costs of vacating certain facilities, or other costs associated with exiting activities that would affect the pro forma financial statements. Management of Applied and Varian are in the process of making these assessments and estimates of these costs are not currently known.
Applied has not identified any pre-Merger contingencies in which the related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount of the asset, liability or impairment can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period, if information becomes available which would indicate it is probable that such events have occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the purchase price allocation.
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 16, 2011  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the world's leading supplier of manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Oct. 30, 2011.
In the fourth quarter, Applied generated orders of $1.60 billion, net sales of $2.18 billion and operating income of $361 million. Fourth-quarter net income was $456 million or 34 cents per share including a tax benefit equivalent to 13 cents per share that was disclosed previously in a Form 8-K filed on Sept. 8, 2011. Non-GAAP operating income was $384 million, and non-GAAP net income was $271 million or 21 cents per share.
For fiscal year 2011, the company reported orders of $10.14 billion, record net sales of $10.52 billion, operating income of $2.40 billion, and net income of $1.93 billion or $1.45 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.41 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.72 billion or $1.30 per share.
"Applied's record year was driven by strength in our silicon business and our highest-ever revenue in solar and services, as well as strategic programs that improved the efficiency of our operations," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer. "While we expect the first half of fiscal 2012 to be impacted by the challenging economic environment, we anticipate that our overall business will strengthen during the second half of the year."
After the end of the quarter, Applied completed the acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment. "The combination of Applied and Varian creates the industry leader in transistor technologies," Splinter added. "Together, we will partner with our customers to accelerate the development of new generations of chips enabling smaller, faster and more power-efficient mobile devices."
During the quarter, Applied generated operating cash flow of $698 million or 32 percent of net sales including a $276 million tax refund. The company paid cash dividends of $106 million and used $175 million to repurchase 16 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $11.04 per share.

"In 2011, Applied invested $1.1 billion in research, development and engineering and generated $2.4 billion in operating cash flow, the most in company history," said George Davis, chief financial officer. "During the year, we increased our quarterly dividend payment by 14 percent and returned $865 million to our stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks."
Quarterly Financial Results Summary
 
Non-GAAP results for the above periods exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain discrete tax items, restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions, certain acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, and gain or loss on sale of facilities. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statements included in this release. See also "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Fourth Quarter Reportable Segment Results and Comparisons to the Prior Quarter
Silicon Systems Group (SSG) orders were $925 million, down 25 percent primarily due to weaker demand in flash and DRAM. Net sales were $1.07 billion, down 24 percent. Operating income decreased to $278 million or 26 percent of net sales, reflecting the decrease in net sales. New order composition was: foundry 46 percent, logic and other 32 percent, flash 15 percent, and DRAM 7 percent.
Applied Global Services (AGS) orders were $564 million, down 8 percent. Net sales were $629 million, up 4 percent and included $70 million in net sales for two thin film solar production lines. Operating income increased to $160 million or 26 percent of net sales, reflecting the increase in net sales.
Display orders were $20 million, down 91 percent, due to lower demand for TV and mobile device display equipment. Net sales were $171 million, down 23 percent, and operating income decreased to $31 million or 18 percent of net sales, driven by lower net sales and a higher proportion of lower-margin products.
Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) orders were $86 million, down 73 percent, as customers continued to absorb recent capital additions. Net sales were $315 million, down 44 percent. Operating income decreased to $17 million or 5 percent of net sales, reflecting the net sales decline.

Additional Quarterly Financial Information
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook
For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, and including the impact of the recent acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment, Applied expects net sales to be down 5 percent to 15 percent sequentially. The company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.16. The non-GAAP EPS outlook excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of approximately $0.10 per share but does not exclude other non-GAAP adjustments that may arise subsequent to this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(z) as to the Record Stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name and address of such Record Stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (ii)(A) the class or series and the number of shares of capital stock that are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such Record Stockholder and by any such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such Record Stockholder and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any short interest in any security of the corporation (for purposes of this Section 2.5 a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (D) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such Record Stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (E) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instrument held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such Record Stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (F) any performance-related fees (other than an asset based fee) that such Record Stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instrument, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such Record Stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such Record Stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of such record date). For purposes of these bylaws, the terms "beneficial owner" and "beneficial ownership" shall include without limitation the meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 13d-3 (or any successor rule) under the Exchange Act.
The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information in addition to that required by paragraph (A)(2)(z) as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
 
(3) In the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the corporation's nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least eighty-five (85) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Record Stockholder's notice pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new seats on the board of directors created by such increase, if it is delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
(B)
Special Meetings of Stockholders.
No business other than that stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders shall be transacted at such special meeting. If the business stated in the corporation's notice of a special meeting of stockholders includes electing one or more directors to the board of directors, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at such special meeting may be made only (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any Record Stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the corporation's notice of meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who gives timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary; clause (2) of this sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations before a special meeting of stockholders. To be timely, a Record Stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the 75th day prior to such special meeting or, (b) if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than eighty five (85) days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. Such Record Stockholder's notice shall set forth the information called for by clauses (x) and (z) of paragraph (A)(2) above.
(C) General.
(1) The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 and, if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.5, to declare that such non-compliant proposal or nomination be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these bylaws, unless otherwise required by law, if a Record Stockholder (or qualified representative) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business proposed by such stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.5, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, even though proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
 
the corporation. In order to be considered a qualified representative of the Record Stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such Record Stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such Record Stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such Record Stockholder to act for such Record Stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders, and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders for inspection by the secretary of the meeting.
(2) For purposes of this Section 2.5, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in any periodic or current report of the corporation filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(3) Any references in this Section 2.5 to the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to paragraph (A)(2) or (B) of this Section 2.5. Nothing in these bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of a stockholder to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
(4) All notices required to be given by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.5 must be in writing and delivered to the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation in person or by first class United States mail postage prepaid or by reputable overnight delivery service within the time limits specified in this Section 2.5. Any other form of communication, including without limitation facsimile transmission and email, shall not satisfy the notice requirements of this Section 2.5 applicable to stockholders.
. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given (including without limitation by a form of electronic transmission in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware) shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6

. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of Delaware or by the certificate of incorporation. Except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority of such quorum shall be deemed the act of the stockholders. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either
2.7
Quorum
 
(i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting (except as otherwise provided by Section 2.8 of these bylaws or the General Corporation Law of Delaware), until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.8
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
. The board of directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the board of directors. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the board of directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting, (ii) rules and procedures relating to maintaining order at the meeting, the efficient conduct of the business of the meeting, the manner of voting at the meeting, and the safety of those present, (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to Record Stockholders of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; and (vi) adjournment of the meeting either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

2.9
Conduct of Business
. Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. Voting may be by voice or by written ballot as the presiding officer of the meeting of the stockholders shall determine. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted. If authorized by the board of directors, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.10
Voting
 
. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.11
Waiver of Notice
. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.
2.12
Record Date for Stockholder Notice
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; , , that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
provided
however
. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after one year from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the
2.13
Proxies
 
corporation generally. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic or telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact.
. The board of directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives, to act at the meetings of stockholders and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by law.

3.2
Number of Directors
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
. Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Each director of the corporation shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting of the stockholders held for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; , that at any meeting of the stockholders for which the secretary of the corporation determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the record date for such meeting, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section 3.3, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. Votes cast shall include votes "for" and "against" a nominee and exclude "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" with respect to that nominee's election. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the board of directors shall establish procedures, and may amend the same from time to time, under which any director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the
3.3
Election, Qualification and Term of Office of Directors
provided, however
 
board of directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors on whether to accept or reject the offer of resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the underlying rationale within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. In making their respective decisions, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the board of directors shall consider all factors they deem relevant. The director who tenders his or her offer of resignation shall not participate in the vote in either the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation or the board of directors' decision. Directors need not be stockholders. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice or electronic transmission given to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. When one or more directors so resign and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.

If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
The stockholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.
If a vacancy is the result of action taken by the stockholders under Section 3.13 of these bylaws, then the vacancy shall be filled by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

If the notice is delivered personally or by electronic transmission, telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered personally or by electronic transmission or telephone or to the telegraph company at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to

. At all meetings of the board of directors or any committee of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors or any committee of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by the General Corporation Law of Delaware or by the certificate of incorporation.

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
3.9
Waiver of Notice
. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
. Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director.

The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 16, 2012  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the world's leading supplier of manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended January 29, 2012.
Applied generated orders of $2.01 billion and net sales of $2.19 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $344 million, and non-GAAP net income was $240 million or 18 cents per share. GAAP operating income was $179 million, and GAAP net income was $117 million or 9 cents per share. Applied completed the acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. during the quarter, and the results include Varian's operations for the full period.
"Global demand for mobile devices is driving a third consecutive year of strong capital investment by semiconductor customers," said Mike Splinter, chairman and chief executive officer. "As a result, we see solid order momentum and an improved outlook overall for our second quarter."
"Applied delivered net sales and earnings above the high end of our expectations," said George Davis, chief financial officer. "In a quarter in which we closed the Varian acquisition, we also returned substantial capital to our stockholders, paying $104 million in cash dividends and using $200 million to repurchase over 18 million shares of our common stock."
Quarterly Financial Results Summary
 
Applied Materials, Inc.
Page 2 of 11
 
During the quarter, Varian generated orders of approximately $270 million and net sales of approximately $200 million which were reported within the Silicon Systems Group (SSG) and Applied Global Services (AGS) segments. The Varian business contributed approximately $0.01 to the company's non-GAAP EPS, which excludes acquisition-related charges equivalent to approximately $0.09 per share.
Non-GAAP results for the above periods exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain discrete tax items, restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions, certain acquisition-related costs, investment impairments, and gain or loss on sale of facilities. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statements included in this release. See also "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
First Quarter Reportable Segment Results and Comparisons to the Prior Quarter
Silicon Systems Group orders were $1.42 billion, up 53 percent reflecting increased demand in foundry and the addition of Varian's business. Net sales were $1.34 billion, up 26 percent. Non-GAAP operating income increased to $386 million or 29 percent of net sales. GAAP operating income was $271 million or 20 percent of net sales. New order composition was: foundry 57 percent, logic and other 14 percent, flash 19 percent, and DRAM 10 percent.
Applied Global Services orders were $517 million, down 8 percent. Net sales were $534 million, down 15 percent, in line with the company's expectations. AGS orders and net sales reflected lower wafer starts, partially offset by the addition of Varian's business; net sales also reflected lower thin film solar volumes. Non-GAAP operating income decreased to $113 million or 21 percent of net sales, reflecting the decrease in net sales. GAAP operating income was $107 million or 20 percent of net sales.
Display orders were $40 million, reflecting ongoing weakness in LCD TV equipment demand. Net sales were $104 million, down 39 percent, and non-GAAP operating income decreased to $7 million or 7 percent of net sales, driven by the decrease in net sales. GAAP operating income was $5 million or 5 percent of net sales.
Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) orders were $33 million, down 62 percent, reflecting solar industry overcapacity. Net sales were $207 million, down 34 percent. The segment had a non-GAAP operating loss of $17 million and a GAAP operating loss of $23 million.

Business Outlook
For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied expects net sales to be up 5 percent to 15 percent sequentially. The company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.28. The non-GAAP EPS outlook excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of approximately $0.05 per share but does not exclude other non-GAAP adjustments that may arise subsequent to this release.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Webcast Information
Applied Materials will discuss these results during an earnings call that begins at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. A live webcast will be available at .

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) The Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company") was held on March 6, 2012 (the "Annual Meeting"). At the Annual Meeting, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's amended and restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") and amended and restated Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan").
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan
The Stock Plan is intended to attract, motivate, and retain (a) employees of Applied and its subsidiaries, (b) directors of the Company who are employees of neither the Company nor any subsidiary, and (c) consultants who provide significant services to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Stock Plan also is designed to encourage stock ownership by employees, directors, and consultants, thereby aligning their interests with those of Applied's stockholders, and to permit the payment of compensation that qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Stock Plan permits grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units, performance shares and restricted stock units to eligible employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stockholders had previously approved the Employee Stock Incentive Plan at the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At the Annual Meeting, the Company's stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of Applied common stock available for issuance under the Stock Plan by 125,000,000 shares.
The Stock Plan is administered by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"). Subject to the terms of the Stock Plan, the Committee has the sole discretion to select the employees, directors and consultants who will receive awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards, and interpret the provisions of the plan and outstanding awards.
The foregoing description of the Stock Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Stock Plan, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Amended and Restated Senior Executive Bonus Plan
The Bonus Plan provides for the payment of awards upon the achievement of specified performance goals. The Committee selects the officers of the Company or its affiliates who may participate and be eligible to receive awards under the Bonus Plan, and assigns each participant a target award and performance goal(s) for a performance period. The target award typically will be expressed as a dollar amount or as a percentage of base salary earned during the applicable performance period. The performance goals set by the Committee may require the achievement of objectives for one or more of: cash flow, customer satisfaction, earnings per share, margin, market share, operating profit, product development and quality, profit, return on capital, return
on equity, revenue or total shareholder return. The Committee may choose to measure performance goals in absolute terms, in combination with one or more performance goal(s), in relative terms, on a per-share or per-capita basis, against the performance of the Company as a whole or of a specific business unit(s), business segment(s) or product(s) of the Company, or on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. Each performance period may last from one fiscal year (or a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters) to three fiscal years (or a period of twelve consecutive fiscal quarters).
The actual award that is payable to a participant under the Bonus Plan is determined using a formula that increases or decreases the participant's target award based on the level of actual performance attained. The Bonus Plan limits actual awards to a maximum of $5,000,000 per person for or in any fiscal year. The Committee has discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the actual award of any participant.
The foregoing description of the Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Bonus Plan, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
At the Annual Meeting, Applied's stockholders cast their votes on five proposals, as set forth below.
Proposal 1. Election of Directors.
 
Each of the eleven nominees was elected to serve as a director for a one-year term and until he or she is succeeded by another qualified director who has been elected, or, if earlier, until his or her death, resignation or removal.
Proposal 2.  Approval of the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan.
 
The amended and restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan was approved.
Proposal 3.  Approval of the Amended and Restated Senior Executive Bonus Plan.
 
The amended and restated Senior Executive Bonus Plan was approved.
Proposal 4.  Approval, on an Advisory Basis, of the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers.

Proposal 5.  Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
 
The appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2012 was ratified.

Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the forfeited or repurchased Shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Plan. Shares that have been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if unvested Shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an Award and/or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, Shares covered by Awards that are surrendered or cancelled under any Exchange Program will not again be available for grant under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, subject to adjustment provided in Section 4.3, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 4.1, plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 4.2.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Adjustments in Awards and Authorized Shares
 
4.4 Grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units under the Plan shall count against the numerical limits in Section 4.1 of the Plan as two Shares for every one Share subject thereto. If Shares acquired pursuant to Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units granted on or after the Effective Date are forfeited to the Company and otherwise would return to the Plan pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Plan, two times the number of Shares so forfeited shall become available for issuance. For purposes of clarification, if Shares acquired pursuant to any Awards granted prior to the Effective Date are forfeited to the Company and otherwise would return to the Plan pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Plan, one times the number of Shares so forfeited shall become available for issuance.
Full Value Awards.
 
4.5 In the event of a Change of Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Committee (in its discretion) determines, including, without limitation, that each Award be assumed or an equivalent option or right be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the transaction.
Change of Control.
 
4.5.1 . If, in connection with a Change of Control, the successor corporation (or a parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation) does not assume or substitute outstanding Awards that were granted on or after the Effective Date, then, with respect to such Awards and no later than immediately prior to the Change of Control: (a) each Participant will vest fully in, and have the right to exercise, all of such Awards that are Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, (b) all other such Awards that are not Options or SARs will fully vest and any applicable restrictions will lapse, and (c) with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or SAR granted on or after the Effective Date is not assumed or substituted in the event of a Change of Control, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the Change of Control provided that either (1) before the Change of Control, the Committee notifies the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, or (2) immediately after the Change of Control, the Participant receives a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value (calculated at the time of the Change of Control) of the Shares covered by the Option or SAR, minus the Exercise Price of the Shares covered by the Option or SAR. All Awards that become fully vested pursuant to this Section 4.5.1 will terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Change of Control.
Non-Assumption of Awards
 
4.5.2 . For the purposes of this Section 4.5, an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Shares held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the greatest number of holders of outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or SAR or upon the payout of any other Award, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.5 to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change of Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Assumption
 
 
5.1 . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants at any time and from time to time as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the number of Shares subject to each Option, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant shall be granted Options (and/or SARs) covering more than a total of 4,500,000 Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Fiscal Year in which a Participant first becomes an Employee, he or she may be granted Options (and/or SARs) to purchase up to a total of an additional 4,500,000 Shares.

5.3.2 . In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Exercise Price shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date; provided, however, that if on the Grant Date, the Employee (together with persons whose stock ownership is attributed to the Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Exercise Price shall be not less than one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date.
Incentive Stock Options
 
5.3.3 . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5.3, in the event that the Company or a Subsidiary consummates a transaction described in Section 424(a) of the Code (e.g., the acquisition of property or stock from an unrelated corporation), persons who become Employees, Nonemployee Directors or Consultants on account of such transaction may be granted Options in substitution for options granted by their former employer. If such substitute Options are granted, the Committee, in its sole discretion and consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code, may determine that such substitute Options shall have an Exercise Price less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Grant Date.
Substitute Options

Notwithstanding Section 5.4.1, if a Participant dies prior to the expiration of his or her Options, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide that his or her Options shall be exercisable for up to three (3) years after the date of death. With respect to extensions that were not included in the original terms of the Option but were provided by the Committee after the Grant Date, if at the time of any such extension, the Exercise Price of the Option is less than the Fair Market Value of a Share, the extension shall, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be limited to the earlier of (a) the maximum term of the Option as set by its original terms, or (b) ten (10) years from the Grant Date.
Death of Participant
 
5.4.3 . Subject to the seven (7) and ten (10)-year limits of Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, the Committee, in its sole discretion, (a) shall provide in each Award Agreement when each Option expires and becomes unexercisable, and (b) may, after an Option is granted, extend the maximum term of the Option (subject to Section 5.8.4 regarding Incentive Stock Options). With respect to the Committee's authority in Section 5.4.3(b), if, at the time of any such extension, the Exercise Price of the Option is less than the Fair Market Value of a Share, the extension shall, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be limited to the earlier of (1) the maximum term of the Option as set by its originals terms, or (2) ten (10) years from the Grant Date. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any extension of the term of an Option pursuant to this Section 5.4.3 shall comply with Section 409A to the extent applicable.
Committee Discretion
 
5.5 . Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. After an Option is granted, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the exercisability of the Option.
Exercisability of Options
 
5.6 . In order to exercise an Option, the Participant shall give notice in the form specified by the Company and follow such procedures as the Company (or its designee) may specify from time to time. Exercise of an Option also requires that the Participant make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for full payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares. All exercise notices shall be given in the form and manner specified by the Company from time to time.
Payment
 
The Exercise Price shall be payable to the Company in full in cash or its equivalent. The Committee, in its sole discretion, also may permit exercise (a) by tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Exercise Price, or (b) by any other means which the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to both provide legal consideration for the Shares, and to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. As soon as practicable after receipt of a notification of exercise satisfactory to the Company and full payment for the Shares purchased, the Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant's
 
designated broker), Share certificates (which may be in book entry form) representing such Shares. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.3 of the Plan.
 
5.7 . The Committee may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option as it may deem advisable, including, but not limited to, restrictions related to applicable federal securities laws, the requirements of any national securities exchange or system upon which Shares are then listed or traded, or any blue sky or state securities laws.

Exercisability
 
5.8.2 . No Incentive Stock Option may be exercised more than three (3) months after the Participant's Termination of Service for any reason other than Disability or death, unless (a) the Participant dies during such three-month period, and/or (b) the Award Agreement or the Committee permits later exercise (in which case the Option instead may be deemed to be a Nonqualified Stock Option). No Incentive Stock Option may be exercised more than one (1) year after the Participant's Termination of Service on account of Disability, unless (a) the Participant dies during such one-year period, and/or (b) the Award Agreement or the Committee permit later exercise (in which case the option instead may be deemed to be a Nonqualified Stock Option).

13.8 . No Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or to the limited extent provided in Section 13.7. All rights with respect to an Award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, if the Committee (in its discretion) so permits, transfer an Award to an individual or entity other than the Company for estate planning or charitable purposes. Any such transfer shall be made as a gift (i.e., without consideration) and in accordance with such procedures as the Committee may specify from time to time.
Limited Transferability of Awards
 
13.9 . Except to the limited extent provided in Sections 7.6 and 7.7, no Participant (nor any beneficiary) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or beneficiary).
No Rights as Stockholder
 
13.10 . If, within 12 months after a Change of Control, a Participant's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or the Participant voluntary terminates his or her employment with Good Reason, the vesting of each outstanding Award held by such Participant that was both granted prior to the Change of Control and on or after the Effective Date shall be accelerated as described in Section 4.5.1. If a Participant who is a Nonemployee Director ceases to be such as of the date of a Change of Control (and does not become a member of the board of directors of the successor corporation, or a parent of the successor corporation), the vesting of each outstanding Award then held by the Participant that was granted on or after the Effective Date shall be accelerated as described in Section 4.5.1, as if the Award was not assumed or substituted for in the Change of Control. The accelerated vesting provided by this Section 13.10 shall not apply to an Award if: (a) the applicable Award Agreement specifically provides that the provisions of this Section 13.10 shall not apply to the Award, or (b) the Participant's employment or service on the Board is terminated due to the Participant's death or Disability.
Vesting of Awards following Change of Control
 
 
14.1 . The Board, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable laws. In addition, an amendment will be subject to stockholder approval if the Committee or the Board, in their sole discretion, deems such amendment to be a material amendment, except with respect to such an amendment that will impact Awards covering, in the aggregate, no more than five percent (5%) of the shares reserved for issuance under the Plan. The following amendments shall be deemed material amendments for purposes of the preceding sentence: (a) material increases to the benefits accrued to Participants under the Plan; (b) increases to the number of securities that may be issued under the Plan; (c) material modifications to the requirements for participation in the Plan, and (d) the addition of a new provision allowing the Committee to lapse or waive restrictions at its discretion. The amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant. No Award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Committee's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Amendment, Suspension, or Termination
 
14.2 . The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date, and subject to Section 14.1 (regarding the Board's right to amend or terminate the Plan), shall remain in effect thereafter. However, without further stockholder approval, no Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after January 19, 2022.
Duration of the Plan
 
 
15.1 . Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), or at such earlier time as the Tax Obligations are due, the Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy all Tax Obligations.
Withholding Requirements
 
15.2 . The Committee, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may designate the method or methods by which a Participant may satisfy such Tax Obligations. As determined by the Committee in its discretion from time to time, these methods may include one or more of the following: (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld or remitted, provided the delivery of such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences as the Committee determines in its sole discretion, (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the Tax Obligations required to be withheld, (e) retaining from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant cash having a
Withholding Arrangements
 
sufficient value to satisfy the Tax Obligations, or (f) any other means which the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to both comply with Applicable Laws, and to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. The amount of Tax Obligations will be deemed to include any amount that the Committee agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant or the Company, as applicable, with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax or social insurance liability to be withheld or remitted is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall be determined as of the date that the Tax Obligations are required to be withheld.
 
 
16.1 . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.
Gender and Number
 
16.2 . In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
Severability
 
16.3 . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise or vesting of an Award unless the exercise or vesting of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Requirements of Law
 
16.4 . With respect to Section 16 Persons, transactions under this Plan are intended to qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3. To the extent any provision of the Plan, Award Agreement or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable or appropriate by the Committee.
Securities Law Compliance
 
16.5 . As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
16.6 . The Company will not be required to issue any Shares, cash or other property under the Plan unless all the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the admission of the Shares or other property to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock or property then is listed; (b) the completion of any registration or other qualification or rule compliance of the Shares under any U.S. state or federal law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock exchange on which Shares of the same class are then listed, or any other governmental regulatory body, as counsel to the Company, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable; (c) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
any U.S. federal, state or other governmental agency, which counsel to the Company, in its absolute discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the Grant Date, vesting and/or exercise as the Company may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience. If the Committee determines, in its absolute discretion, that one or more of the preceding conditions will not be satisfied, the Company automatically will be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue the Shares, cash or other property as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
 
16.7 . The Plan and all Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of California (with the exception of its conflict of laws provisions).

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On May 9, 2012, a committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied or the Company) approved a plan (the Plan) to restructure the Company's Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) equipment markets. These actions are consistent with the Company's previously-stated goal to reduce the EES segment's annual revenue breakeven level to $500 million in fiscal 2013.
As part of the Plan, Applied expects to relocate manufacturing for its Precision Wafering System (PWS) solar business based in Cheseaux, Switzerland to Asia. PWS business operations and customer support functions will be relocated primarily to Treviso, Italy, the headquarters for Applied's Baccini Cell Systems, and Xi'an, China, the site of Applied's Solar Technology Center. PWS's headquarters and new product development will remain in Switzerland. The Plan also includes significant reductions in development activities for LED. Workforce-related actions will be finalized and implemented in accordance with local legal requirements and in consultation with employees and employee representative bodies, as required.
The total estimated pre-tax cost of implementing the Plan is expected to be in the range of approximately $70 million to $100 million, or $0.04 to $0.06 per share, which will be incurred over the next 12 to 18 months beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This estimate consists of: (i) up to $30 million in fixed asset impairment charges; (ii) up to $15 million of inventory-related charges; (iii) up to $15 million in charges arising from lease terminations and other obligations, and (iv) up to $40 million in severance and other employee-related costs. The Plan will impact up to approximately 250 positions globally. The Company expects up to $55 million in cash expenditures under the Plan. Applied does not anticipate any significant cash outlays related to the disposition of assets impaired under the Plan. The estimated inventory charges of up to $15 million, or $0.01 per share, will be included in non-GAAP as well as GAAP results.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.

For the full year, Applied is updating its previous outlook for net sales and non-GAAP EPS, provided on March 28, 2012.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the companys operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the companys business from the same perspective as the companys management and facilitate comparisons of this periods results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Gary E. Dickerson, age 54, has been appointed as President of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied" or the "Company"), effective June 19, 2012. Mr. Dickerson will report to Michael R. Splinter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Applied. Mr. Splinter had also served as Applied's President until Mr. Dickerson's appointment to the position. Mr. Dickerson previously served as Chief Executive Officer and a director of Varian Semiconductor Associates, Inc. ("Varian"), from 2004 until Applied's acquisition of Varian in November 2011 (the "merger"). Since then, Mr. Dickerson has been an employee of Applied reporting to Mr. Splinter on merger integration matters.
Mr. Dickerson's initial annual salary as President will be $750,000, and he will be eligible to earn an annual target bonus of 150% of his base salary. The actual bonus earned, if any, will depend on the achievement of performance goals to be established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors under the Applied Incentive Plan and will be prorated for Mr. Dickerson's service from June 19, 2012.
Mr. Dickerson was granted an award of 500,000 performance shares under Applied's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. Similar to other Applied executives, vesting of these shares requires the achievement of targeted levels of annual, adjusted relative operating profit margin by Applied as compared to a group of peer companies. The level of actual performance achieved will determine the number of shares (if any and not to exceed 500,000) that may vest over the four years ending July 1, 2016, so long as Mr. Dickerson remains an Applied employee through the vesting date. In addition, up to an additional 50% of any earned performance shares (that is, up to an additional 250,000 shares at maximum performance) may be earned by Mr. Dickerson if Applied's total shareholder return for the two-year (eight fiscal quarter) period beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and ending with the second quarter of fiscal 2014 meets or exceeds certain total shareholder return levels relative to a peer group comprised of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Technology Sector. If earned, any such additional shares would vest on the same schedule as the shares earned through annual, adjusted relative operating profit margin performance.
In addition, Mr. Dickerson was granted an award of 550,000 shares of restricted stock under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan. Vesting of these shares requires the achievement of a targeted level of operating profit margin by Applied. If the targeted performance level is achieved, the shares are scheduled to vest in three annual installments (of 40%, 40% and 20%) over the three years ending June 19, 2015 (assuming continued employment by Mr. Dickerson through the vesting date).
If Applied terminates Mr. Dickerson's employment without cause (as defined in Mr. Dickerson's offer letter) on or after May 11, 2013, Mr. Dickerson will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 250% of his annual salary, but only if he signs an agreement with a release of claims and non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions in favor of Applied. Under a change of control agreement adopted by Varian and approved by its Board of Directors prior to the merger, if Mr. Dickerson terminates employment with Applied before May 11, 2013, he will be entitled to a payment equal to 299% of his pre-merger salary and bonus, as well as continued participation in employee medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance plans for up to 24 months. Mr. Dickerson's right to a severance payment under his Varian change of control agreement will expire on May 10, 2013.
For the period between the closing of the merger and June 19, 2012, while Mr. Dickerson was working on merger integration matters as an employee of Applied, Mr. Dickerson's compensation arrangements were as follows. He was paid fixed compensation of $2.5 million for the period through May 10, 2012. On May 11, 2012, Mr. Dickerson began receiving a salary of $667,430 per year, which had been his annual salary at Varian prior to the merger. Mr. Dickerson was not eligible for any bonuses or equity grants from Applied prior
 
to his appointment as President. Also as part of Mr. Dickerson's employment arrangements following the merger, Applied accelerated the vesting of equity awards that had been originally granted by Varian and that Applied had assumed as part of the merger and had converted into Applied stock options or rights to receive cash merger consideration. The accelerated awards consisted of Applied stock options (with a weighted average exercise price per share of $5.20) for 1,183,050 shares of Applied common stock, and 125,911 shares of Varian restricted stock that had been converted into rights to receive cash merger consideration.

$1.80 billion
and net sales of
$2.34 billion
. Non-GAAP operating income was
$431 million
, and non-GAAP net income was
$300 million
or
24 cents
per share. GAAP operating income was

, and GAAP net income was
$218 million
or

We delivered solid financial performance in line with our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, display and solar, said Mike Splinter, chairman and CEO.  Economic uncertainty is weighing on top of a seasonal pullback to produce weaker near-term demand.
Applied generated strong operating cash flow and ramped the return of cash to shareholders, buying back 3.6 percent of shares outstanding in the quarter, said George Davis, executive vice president and CFO. In a difficult environment, we are controlling spending while ensuring we prioritize investment in key areas to support future growth. 
Quarterly Results Summary
 
Third quarter results included $44 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, consisting primarily of costs associated with the EES restructuring plan announced on May 10, 2012. The plan also resulted in inventory-related charges of approximately $13 million that lowered gross margin by approximately half a percentage point and earnings per share by $0.01 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
During the quarter, Varian generated orders of $241 million and net sales of $294 million which were reported within the Silicon Systems Group (SSG) and Applied Global Services (AGS) segments.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On October 3, 2012, Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied) approved a restructuring plan (the Plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. Under the Plan, Applied will implement a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that are expected to affect approximately 900 to 1,300 positions, or 6 percent to 9 percent of its global workforce. The voluntary retirement program will be available to certain U.S. employees who meet minimum age and length of service requirements, as well as other business-specific criteria. In addition, Applied plans to implement other workforce reduction actions globally across multiple business segments and functions, the extent of which will depend on the number of employees who participate in the voluntary retirement program and other considerations.
Applied expects to substantially complete the Plan by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013, depending on local legal requirements. Upon completion, the Plan is projected to make available approximately $140 million to $190 million annually to fund key growth initiatives.
In connection with the Plan, Applied expects to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of severance and other termination benefits in the range of $180 million to $230 million, substantially all of which will be paid in cash. Due to the nature of the Plan, the projected cost amounts are subject to multiple assumptions and estimates, including with respect to: the number and job levels of employees who participate in the voluntary retirement program, the nature and extent of additional workforce actions required to complete the Plan, and other factors. Applied will begin recording these restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and expects that the remainder will be recorded during fiscal 2013.

Exhibit 99.1
APPLIED MATERIALS ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2012 RESULTS
Expects Orders to Increase in the First Quarter of FY2013
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 15, 2012  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the global leader in manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2012.
In the fourth quarter, Applied generated orders of
$1.47 billion
and net sales of
$1.65 billion
. The company recorded a goodwill impairment and restructuring charges totaling $545 million and reported an operating loss of
$499 million
, with a net loss of
$515 million
or
42 cents
per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating income was
$114 million
, and non-GAAP net income was
$70 million
or
6 cents
per share, at the high end of the company's expectations.
In FY2012, the company reported orders of
$8.04 billion
, net sales of
$8.72 billion
, operating income of
$411 million
, and net income of
$109 million
or
9 cents
per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was
$1.38 billion
, and non-GAAP net income was
$960 million
or
75 cents
per share.
In our fourth quarter, Applied delivered profit at the high end of our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, solar and display, said Mike Splinter, Chairman and CEO. Our strong cash flow performance allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend and share buybacks, returning
$1.85 billion
to stockholders in the year.
We see improving business conditions entering 2013, with orders projected to increase after bottoming in the fourth quarter," Splinter added. "Accelerated changes in device technology and the adoption of new materials in all of the industries we serve provide opportunities for Applied to build on our leadership and grow our market share.
Quarterly Results Summary
 
Fourth quarter results included a
$421 million
goodwill impairment charge associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) segment. The goodwill impairment reflects the deterioration in solar equipment market conditions, our customers' financial condition and reduced market valuations, causing Applied to reassess the recoverability of the segment's goodwill. Applied also reported $124 million in charges related to previously announced restructuring plans and the integration of Varian.
Applied Materials, Inc.
