FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE EXHIBIT 99 Media Contacts: Deborah Spak, 847-948-2349 Tanya Tyska, 847-948-3256 Investor Contacts: Neville Jeharajah, 847-948-2875 Mary Kay Ladone, 847-948-3371 BAXTER ADVISES CUSTOMERS TO SUSPEND USE OF CERTAIN BLOODLINES AND SAFETY FISTULA NEEDLES AS INVESTIGATION OF HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENTS CONTINUES DEERFIELD, Ill, September 13, 2002 - Earlier this month, Baxter Healthcare Corporation was notified that four patients died over a one- to two-week period after receiving dialysis treatment at a hemodialysis center in Mishawauka, Indiana. The investigation is in its early stages, and it remains unclear whether the deaths were due to the underlying disease of the patients or an element of the treatment. The process of investigating deaths associated with hemodialysis is very complex because there are many potential contributing factors - from a patient's underlying condition to the many complex elements involved in the treatment. Each of these elements, from the variety of dialysis products and equipment manufactured by numerous companies to the clinical procedures and protocols in place at the center, will need to be assessed over the course of the investigation. "Patient safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with the medical community, other dialysis product suppliers and regulatory authorities to 4 of 5
better understand the circumstances surrounding the deaths," said John Quick, Baxter's corporate vice president for Quality/Regulatory. While the investigation is continuing, Baxter is advising customers who may be using a specific bloodline in conjunction with Baxter's Meridian machine and a certain safety arterial/venous fistula needle - neither of which Baxter manufactures - to suspend their use until they have been eliminated as a potentially contributing factor. The company's preliminary examination of the Meridian machine showed it to be operating properly. The Meridian has been on the market for several years and is sold primarily in the United States, with a small number sold in Mexico and Asia. Sales of these various products are not material to Baxter's Renal business. Baxter was notified of one additional patient death during the same timeframe at a center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Based on the information provided to Baxter by this center, it does not appear at this time that the unfortunate incident in Michigan is related to those reported in Indiana. However, the investigation is continuing. Baxter Healthcare Corporation is the principal domestic operating subsidiary of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX), a global health care company that, through its subsidiaries, provides critical therapies for people with life-threatening conditions. Baxter's bioscience, medication delivery and renal products and services are used to treat patients with some of the most challenging medical conditions, including cancer, hemophilia, immune deficiencies, infectious diseases, kidney disease and trauma.

NEWS RELEASE EXHIBIT 99 BAXTER TO SELL SERVICES COMPONENT OF RENAL BUSINESS Company to Focus Renal Business Primarily on Product Portfolio Deerfield, Ill., December 3, 2002 -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) announced today its intent to divest the majority of the services component of its Renal business and focus primarily on products used in the treatment of kidney disease. Baxter's renal services portfolio includes U.S.-based RMS Disease Management and RMS Lifeline, as well as Renal Therapy Services (RTS) dialysis centers, which are located outside the United States. "After evaluating our current business strategy, we believe that Renal's long-term growth can be enhanced by increasing our focus and resources on expanding our product portfolio in peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy and pharmaceuticals," said Alan Heller, senior vice president and president of Baxter's Renal business. "We believe that by selling these businesses at this time to organizations that are more focused on providing services, they will have greater opportunities for further growth." Baxter intends to retain certain RTS centers that are integral to the company's renal products business in particular markets. The majority of the RTS centers Baxter plans to sell are located in Latin America and Europe. The total service operations Baxter intends to divest accounted for approximately 13 percent of the Renal business' 2001 sales of $1.9 billion. Baxter expects to record an after-tax charge of approximately $250 million, or $.40 per diluted common share, against fourth-quarter earnings related to the divestiture of these businesses. Approximately 90 percent of the charge will be non-cash. In addition, the Renal services component to be divested will be accounted for as a discontinued operation in the company's financial statements. Excluding this charge, as well as previously announced charges, including charges related to acquisitions to occur in the fourth quarter, Baxter expects to achieve sales growth in the low double digits, earnings per share growth in the mid-teens and to generate $500 million in operational cash flow (i.e., cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion before capital expenditures) in 2002, as well as for full-year 2003. Baxter entered the renal services business in 1995, opening and acquiring RTS centers in a number of countries outside the United States. In 1996, Baxter formed RMS Disease Management to provide comprehensive patient care management for health-care providers and insurance companies. And in 1998, Baxter launched RMS Lifeline to manage outpatient clinics where dialysis patients undergo vascular access surgery. Baxter International Inc. is a global health care company that, through its subsidiaries, provides critical therapies for people with life-threatening conditions. Baxter's bioscience, medication delivery and renal therapies are used to treat individuals with such medical conditions as cancer, hemophilia, immune deficiencies, infectious diseases, kidney disease and trauma. This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including demand by potential acquirers, the effect of economic conditions, actions of regulatory bodies, product development risks, product demand and market acceptance, the impact of competitive products and pricing, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks detailed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that the strategy outlined above will be successful. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by management of the company and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results or experience could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Page 4 of 5

Exhibit Index Exhibit No. Description 99 Press Release dated January 22, 2003

Exhibit 99 BAXTER'S SALES AND EARNINGS GROW IN 2002 Sales Advance 10 Percent in the Fourth Quarter, Full-Year 2002 Earnings from Continuing Operations Increase 11 Percent in Quarter, 15 Percent for Full-Year, Excluding Special Charges DEERFIELD, Ill., January 22, 2003 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2002, with sales from continuing operations advancing 10 percent in the quarter and for the year. Sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter totaled $2.26 billion, up from the $2.06 billion reported for the same period last year. Foreign exchange contributed 2 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Domestic sales grew 5 percent, and international sales increased 14 percent. For the full-year, Baxter reported sales from continuing operations of $8.11 billion, an increase from the $7.36 billion reported for 2001. Foreign exchange had no effect on the full-year sales. Domestic sales totaled $3.97 billion, an increase of 7 percent over last year, and international sales totaled $4.14 billion, an increase of 14 percent. Excluding discontinued operations and special charges in 2001 and 2002, Baxter's earnings in the quarter totaled $363 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 11 percent over the fourth quarter of 2001. Baxter's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 included special charges related to the acquisitions of Epic Therapeutics and ESI Lederle, and the planned divestiture of the majority of the company's Renal services portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Baxter's earnings included special charges related to the company's acquisition of Asta Medica Onkologie and the discontinuation of the Althane series of dialyzers. Including these charges, Baxter reported net income of $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares with a net loss of $75 million, or ($0.13) per diluted share, reported for the fourth quarter of 2001. "Our solid fourth quarter performance enabled us to continue to invest significantly in our research and development programs," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. Baxter's investment in research and development increased 23 percent in the fourth quarter, to $142 million. For the full year, excluding discontinued operations and charges, Baxter's earnings increased 15 percent to $1.24 billion, or 13 percent to $2.00 per diluted share, from the $1.07 billion, or $1.77 per diluted share reported last year. Including charges and discontinued operations, Baxter's net earnings totaled $778 million, or $1.26 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $612 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, reported in 2001. Baxter's investment in research and development increased 18 percent to $501 million in 2002. The company generated $468 million in operational cash flow from continuing operations (i.e. cash flow of $1.32 billion before capital expenditures) in 2002. "Despite a challenging environment, we delivered solid sales and earnings growth and cash flow in 2002," Kraemer said. "We advanced several exciting products through our pipeline and the regulatory review process, expanded our production capacity, invested in new technologies, and
completed a number of important acquisitions. All of these initiatives position us well to drive long-term growth that is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient." BioScience Sales of Baxter's BioScience products grew 7 percent in the fourth quarter, to $842 million. Full-year sales of BioScience products totaled $3.10 billion, an increase of 11 percent. Contributing to the growth in 2002 were Recombinate Antihemophilic Factor, vaccines and biosurgery products. Baxter once again led the industry in production of recombinant treatment for hemophilia, and in 2002 submitted filings with Canadian, European and United States regulatory authorities for the company's new Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM). Baxter's rAHF-PFM is the first Factor VIII recombinant therapy to be clinically developed and prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived raw materials in the cell culture process, purification or final formulation. Also in 2002, Baxter grew its vaccines business with licensure of its NeisVac-C vaccine in several additional countries and completed bulk shipments of smallpox vaccine to partner Acambis, Inc. on behalf of the U.S. government. The company also received licensure for its InfluJect influenza vaccine in the Netherlands, and began construction of two state-of-the-art vaccine production facilities in Krems, Austria and Bohumile, Czech Republic. Last month, the company announced an agreement to acquire a plasma-derived treatment for hereditary emphysema, Aralast(TM), and 42 plasma collection centers in the United States from Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, which will expand Baxter's biopharmaceutical product portfolio and enhance the economics of the company's plasma business by increasing the number of fractions it obtains from a liter of plasma. Baxter's BioScience business develops and produces biopharmaceuticals from plasma and through recombinant methods to treat hemophilia, immune deficiencies and other blood-related disorders, as well as vaccines and biosurgery products. Medication Delivery Sales of Baxter's Medication Delivery products advanced 16 percent in the fourth quarter, to $964 million. For the full-year, sales grew 14 percent to $3.32 billion. Strong contributors to Medication Delivery growth in the quarter and year were anesthesia products and drug delivery technologies. Baxter's fast-growing anesthesia and critical care business will further expand in 2003, as a result of the company's recent acquisition of ESI Lederle from Wyeth. Baxter also expanded its drug delivery technology portfolio in 2002, with its acquisition of privately-held Epic Therapeutics. Baxter provides a range of proprietary and specialized drug formulation and delivery platforms for traditional pharmaceutical companies, including ready-to-use pre-filled syringes, vials and intravenous bags. Baxter's Medication Delivery business offers a single source for medication delivery products and services, including drug delivery, intravenous solutions, sets, infusion pumps, parenteral nutrition products, anesthesia devices and pharmaceutical agents. Renal Baxter's Renal sales increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter to $455 million. For the full year, sales totaled $1.70 billion, an increase of 2 percent.
In the fourth quarter, the company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for both a new peritoneal dialysis solution and a new hemofiltration system. Extraneal (icodextrin) peritoneal dialysis solution offers the potential for increased removal of fluid from the blood stream during dialysis. The Accura Hemofiltration System is used in critical care settings to deliver continuous renal replacement and plasma therapies. Baxter also announced in the fourth quarter its intent to divest the majority of the services component of its Renal business and focus primarily on products used in the treatment of kidney disease. Baxter's Renal business provides a complete and complimentary portfolio of dialysis-related products used in the treatment of patients with kidney disease. Outlook for 2003 "Our milestone achievements in 2002 position us well for 2003 and beyond," Kraemer said. "We expect to launch a number of important products across all of our businesses in 2003, and move other promising therapies through the development pipeline and regulatory review process." Looking ahead to full-year 2003, Baxter expects to achieve sales growth from continuing operations in the 10 to 12 percent range, earnings per share in the $2.22 to $2.29 range, and to generate cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion before capital expenditures. For the first quarter of 2003, the company expects to grow sales 7 to 10 percent, and to achieve earnings per diluted share of $0.42 to $0.45. Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, assists health-care professionals and their patients with treatment of complex medical conditions, including cancer, hemophilia, immune disorders, kidney disease and trauma. The company applies its expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.

Exhibit 99 BAXTER'S SALES AND EARNINGS GROW IN 2002 Sales Advance 10 Percent in the Fourth Quarter, Full-Year 2002 Earnings from Continuing Operations Increase 11 Percent in Quarter, 15 Percent for Full-Year, Excluding Special Charges DEERFIELD, Ill., January 22, 2003 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2002, with sales from continuing operations advancing 10 percent in the quarter and for the year. Sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter totaled $2.26 billion, up from the $2.06 billion reported for the same period last year. Foreign exchange contributed 2 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Domestic sales grew 5 percent, and international sales increased 14 percent. For the full-year, Baxter reported sales from continuing operations of $8.11 billion, an increase from the $7.36 billion reported for 2001. Foreign exchange had no effect on the full-year sales. Domestic sales totaled $3.97 billion, an increase of 7 percent over last year, and international sales totaled $4.14 billion, an increase of 14 percent. Excluding discontinued operations and special charges in 2001 and 2002, Baxter's earnings in the quarter totaled $363 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 11 percent over the fourth quarter of 2001. Baxter's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 included special charges related to the acquisitions of Epic Therapeutics and ESI Lederle, and the planned divestiture of the majority of the company's Renal services portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Baxter's earnings included special charges related to the company's acquisition of Asta Medica Onkologie and the discontinuation of the Althane series of dialyzers. Including these charges, Baxter reported net income of $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares with a net loss of $75 million, or ($0.13) per diluted share, reported for the fourth quarter of 2001. "Our solid fourth quarter performance enabled us to continue to invest significantly in our research and development programs," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. Baxter's investment in research and development increased 23 percent in the fourth quarter, to $142 million. For the full year, excluding discontinued operations and charges, Baxter's earnings increased 15 percent to $1.24 billion, or 13 percent to $2.00 per diluted share, from the $1.07 billion, or $1.77 per diluted share reported last year. Including charges and discontinued operations, Baxter's net earnings totaled $778 million, or $1.26 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $612 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, reported in 2001. Baxter's investment in research and development increased 18 percent to $501 million in 2002. The company generated $468 million in operational cash flow from continuing operations (i.e. cash flow of $1.32 billion before capital expenditures) in 2002. "Despite a challenging environment, we delivered solid sales and earnings growth and cash flow in 2002," Kraemer said. "We advanced several exciting products through our pipeline and the regulatory review process, expanded our production capacity, invested in new technologies, and
completed a number of important acquisitions. All of these initiatives position us well to drive long-term growth that is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient." BioScience Sales of Baxter's BioScience products grew 7 percent in the fourth quarter, to $842 million. Full-year sales of BioScience products totaled $3.10 billion, an increase of 11 percent. Contributing to the growth in 2002 were Recombinate Antihemophilic Factor, vaccines and biosurgery products. Baxter once again led the industry in production of recombinant treatment for hemophilia, and in 2002 submitted filings with Canadian, European and United States regulatory authorities for the company's new Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM). Baxter's rAHF-PFM is the first Factor VIII recombinant therapy to be clinically developed and prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived raw materials in the cell culture process, purification or final formulation. Also in 2002, Baxter grew its vaccines business with licensure of its NeisVac-C vaccine in several additional countries and completed bulk shipments of smallpox vaccine to partner Acambis, Inc. on behalf of the U.S. government. The company also received licensure for its InfluJect influenza vaccine in the Netherlands, and began construction of two state-of-the-art vaccine production facilities in Krems, Austria and Bohumile, Czech Republic. Last month, the company announced an agreement to acquire a plasma-derived treatment for hereditary emphysema, Aralast(TM), and 42 plasma collection centers in the United States from Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, which will expand Baxter's biopharmaceutical product portfolio and enhance the economics of the company's plasma business by increasing the number of fractions it obtains from a liter of plasma. Baxter's BioScience business develops and produces biopharmaceuticals from plasma and through recombinant methods to treat hemophilia, immune deficiencies and other blood-related disorders, as well as vaccines and biosurgery products. Medication Delivery Sales of Baxter's Medication Delivery products advanced 16 percent in the fourth quarter, to $964 million. For the full-year, sales grew 14 percent to $3.32 billion. Strong contributors to Medication Delivery growth in the quarter and year were anesthesia products and drug delivery technologies. Baxter's fast-growing anesthesia and critical care business will further expand in 2003, as a result of the company's recent acquisition of ESI Lederle from Wyeth. Baxter also expanded its drug delivery technology portfolio in 2002, with its acquisition of privately-held Epic Therapeutics. Baxter provides a range of proprietary and specialized drug formulation and delivery platforms for traditional pharmaceutical companies, including ready-to-use pre-filled syringes, vials and intravenous bags. Baxter's Medication Delivery business offers a single source for medication delivery products and services, including drug delivery, intravenous solutions, sets, infusion pumps, parenteral nutrition products, anesthesia devices and pharmaceutical agents. Renal Baxter's Renal sales increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter to $455 million. For the full year, sales totaled $1.70 billion, an increase of 2 percent.
In the fourth quarter, the company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for both a new peritoneal dialysis solution and a new hemofiltration system. Extraneal (icodextrin) peritoneal dialysis solution offers the potential for increased removal of fluid from the blood stream during dialysis. The Accura Hemofiltration System is used in critical care settings to deliver continuous renal replacement and plasma therapies. Baxter also announced in the fourth quarter its intent to divest the majority of the services component of its Renal business and focus primarily on products used in the treatment of kidney disease. Baxter's Renal business provides a complete and complimentary portfolio of dialysis-related products used in the treatment of patients with kidney disease. Outlook for 2003 "Our milestone achievements in 2002 position us well for 2003 and beyond," Kraemer said. "We expect to launch a number of important products across all of our businesses in 2003, and move other promising therapies through the development pipeline and regulatory review process." Looking ahead to full-year 2003, Baxter expects to achieve sales growth from continuing operations in the 10 to 12 percent range, earnings per share in the $2.22 to $2.29 range, and to generate cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion before capital expenditures. For the first quarter of 2003, the company expects to grow sales 7 to 10 percent, and to achieve earnings per diluted share of $0.42 to $0.45. Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, assists health-care professionals and their patients with treatment of complex medical conditions, including cancer, hemophilia, immune disorders, kidney disease and trauma. The company applies its expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.

(NYSE:BAX) today announced it has revised its sales growth and earnings per share expectations for the first quarter and full year 2003. Based on increased competition and pricing pressures in the plasma-protein market, reductions in inventory by some providers resulting from increased confidence in the availability of recombinant factor VIII products, and devaluing currencies in Latin America and Turkey, Baxter has revised its expectations for the first quarter and the full year 2003. Specifically, Baxter now expects to achieve sales growth in the 5 to 7 percent range and earnings per diluted share of $0.36 to $0.38 in the first quarter of 2003. For full-year 2003, Baxter expects to achieve sales growth from continuing operations in the 8 to 12 percent range, earnings per share in the $2.10 to $2.20 range, and to generate cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion before capital expenditures. - more -
Baxter Investor Conference - Page 2 - ----------------------------------- "Increased market competition in the plasma protein business and economic instability in some overseas markets are impacting our business," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite our lowered expectations, we anticipate continuing growth across all our businesses in 2003 and beyond. As we will outline in our conference today, we are introducing many new products and developing innovative technologies that provide considerable benefits for health-care providers and patients worldwide." Executives from the company will elaborate on Baxter's financial outlook at its investor conference for investors to be conducted today in Chicago and webcast live via www.baxter.com. During its conference, the company will summarize its comprehensive product portfolio and unique mix of technology platforms that are expected to drive long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. The company also will announce several collaborations, product approvals and contracts, all of which leverage Baxter's extensive manufacturing and product development expertise to commercialize innovative technologies, introduce products into new markets, and tap its specialty sales channels around the globe. "Our unique combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology creates a tremendous competitive advantage for Baxter, and makes us a valued partner to other companies," Kraemer added. "Building upon our pioneering heritage and proven track record of success, we will sustain growth by commercializing - more -
Baxter Investor Conference - Page 3 - ----------------------------------- innovative technologies, launching new products and expanding into new markets, and leveraging the strong customer relationships and sales channels we have established throughout the world." Launching New Products and Expanding into New Markets Several new products are expected to contribute to Baxter's growth in 2003 and beyond. The most significant Baxter product approval anticipated in 2003 is ADVATE, the first Factor VIII recombinant therapy to be clinically developed and prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived raw materials. ADVATE is currently under review in the United States, Europe and Canada, and is expected to launch in the United States in 2003. ADVATE leverages the company's innovative protein-development and manufacturing capability and further enhances the most comprehensive portfolio of anti-hemophilia products from one company. Commercializing Innovative Technologies Baxter executives also will showcase the company's range of proprietary and specialized drug formulation and delivery platforms that it offers to traditional pharmaceutical as well as biotechnology companies, including lyophilization, ready-to-use pre-filled syringes, vials, cartridges used in pen- and auto-injectors, and intravenous bags. Baxter's unique drug delivery technologies, including formulation technologies for insoluble drugs and technologies for sustained release, coupled with its long-standing relationships with pharmaceutical companies have yielded contracts with the 12 largest global pharmaceutical companies and eight of the top ten biopharmaceutical companies. - more -
Baxter Investor Conference - Page 4 - ----------------------------------- Based on Baxter's strengths in service and technology, 11 new compounds were launched in 2002 and launches for up to an additional 20 compounds are anticipated in the next two years. Baxter also has signed two agreements that capitalize on its strengths in commercializing innovative technologies. In an exclusive license with Cytokine PharmaSciences, Inc., Baxter obtained the rights to Cytokine's anti-macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) antibody technology, which shows potential in a wide spectrum of diseases, including asthma, severe infections and certain cancers. And, tapping Baxter's cell-culture and manufacturing expertise, the company signed a non-exclusive collaboration with Fremont, Calif.-based Protein Design Labs, Inc. to humanize, develop and manufacture therapeutic monoclonal antibodies on behalf of other companies. Leveraging Strong Customer Relationships With its global infrastructure and strong customer relationships, Baxter is well-positioned to increase access to needed therapies. To that end, Baxter has signed an exclusive agreement with Cangene Corporation to market WinRho SDF in Europe, excluding Portugal, for the treatment of a critical blood clotting disorder called Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).

(NYSE: BAX) today reported that it achieved its sales and diluted earnings per share (EPS) goals for the first quarter of 2003. Baxter's sales grew 6 percent in the first quarter, while earnings declined as a result of product mix and competitive pricing in the plasma market. Baxter's sales from continuing operations in the quarter rose to $2.0 billion, up from $1.88 billion reported for the same period last year. The increase in sales for the first quarter included a 4 percentage-point benefit from foreign exchange. Sales within the United States grew 4 percent to $956 million, while sales outside the United States grew 9 percent to $1.04 billion (or declined 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange). First quarter sales for Renal grew 2 percent to $407 million and sales in BioScience were down 1 percent at $740 million. Medication Delivery sales grew 17 percent to $850 million. Contributing to the growth in Medication Delivery were strong sales of anesthesia and drug delivery products, as well as sales from ESI Lederle, which Baxter acquired at the end of 2002. - more -
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS - PAGE 2 - --------------------------------------------------- Baxter's earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter totaled $217 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, a decline of 14 percent from the $253 million, or 12 percent from the $0.41 per diluted share reported last year. The first quarter results include a pre-tax impairment charge of $13 million to reflect the decline in the market value of a minority investment. "Despite the current challenges in the plasma protein business, I expect our sales growth for the full year to be in the 8 to 12 percent range and our EPS growth to be in the $2.10 to $2.20 range, in addition to generating cash flows from continuing operations of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion before capital expenditures," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "With the many new product launches we have planned for 2003, combined with our ongoing expansion with current products into new markets, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals." Contributing to growth for full-year 2003 will be the anticipated approval and launch of the company's innovative hemophilia therapy ADVATE, which will offer patients the first Factor VIII recombinant therapy to be clinically developed and prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived raw materials. Specifically for the second quarter, the company expects to achieve sales growth in the range of 8 to 10 percent and EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.42. Among the contributors to the growth in the second quarter will be the launch of several products, including the new peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution, Extraneal, and the ALYX Red Blood Cell Collection System. The launch of Extraneal is the first of several new product launches anticipated in the Renal business this year in an effort to continually refresh its product line for patients with end-stage renal disease. - more -

(NYSE:BAX) today announced several measures to position the company more competitively and to enhance its long-term profitability. The company plans to close 26 plasma collection centers across the United States and a plasma fractionation facility located in Rochester, Mich., to improve the economics of its plasma therapies business. In addition, Baxter has a number of other initiatives underway across the company to reduce expenses, including reductions in its workforce and infrastructure. The company anticipates that it will take a charge in the second quarter of 2003 of approximately $200 million, or $0.30 per share, after-tax (approximately half cash and half non-cash) to write down facilities and for severance -more-
BAXTER ANNOUNCES ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY - PAGE 2 - ---------------------------------------------------------- costs for an estimated 2,500 employees, representing nearly 5 percent of Baxter's global workforce. "We continue to focus on operational excellence to improve our overall performance and enhance our position in a competitive, global marketplace. This focus is directed toward increasing profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. Company Plans to Improve Economics of Plasma Operations The market for plasma-derived products has changed dramatically over the last year, with pricing for some of these therapies declining more than 20 percent. A number of products are fractionated, or manufactured, from human plasma, including albumin, clotting factors used in the treatment of bleeding disorders and immune globulins used in the treatment of immune disorders. Baxter plans to significantly improve its plasma economics by reducing the amount of plasma collected and fractionated, and optimizing its supply. Specifically, Baxter will reduce its total annual plasma production from 4.6 million liters to 4.0 million liters, and will reduce the number of plasma collection centers it operates from 120 centers to 94. The closings of the Rochester, Mich., fractionation facility and the plasma collection centers will impact approximately 800 employees. "While these decisions are difficult, I am confident that these actions are important for the long-term positioning of the company," Kraemer said. Baxter Reduces Guidance for Full-Year 2003 Baxter continues to expect that its second quarter 2003 sales growth will be in the range of 8 to 10 percent, and that earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, including the estimated $0.30 special charge, will be in the range of $0.10 to $0.12. However, Baxter is revising its full-year guidance to reflect expectations of lower growth -more-
BAXTER ANNOUNCES ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY - PAGE 3 - ---------------------------------------------------------- in its BioScience business. Specifically, Baxter expects its results from continuing operations for full-year 2003 to be: .. Sales growth of 8 - 10 percent .. Earnings per diluted share (including the estimated $0.30 charge) of $1.65 to $1.75 .. Cash flow from operations (including estimated cash charges of approximately $100 million) of approximately $1.2 billion The company now expects full-year sales growth in its BioScience business to be in the 5- to 10-percent range, due to reduced sales of plasma-derived therapeutics and slowing industry demand for products used in the collection, storage and processing of blood and blood components. Baxter's expectations for full-year sales growth in its Medication Delivery business remains unchanged, in the 12- to 16-percent range, and Renal sales growth remains unchanged in the range of two to five percent. Baxter will provide an update on the changes announced today and additional details when the company reports its second quarter financial results on Thursday, July 17. Baxter also will conduct a live webcast of its second quarter conference call for investors, which can be accessed from a link on Baxter's website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CDT on July 17, 2003.

BAXTER ANNOUNCES ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY - PAGE 4 - ---------------------------------------------------------- Related Questions and Answers - ----------------------------- Q1. How much will Baxter save as a result of these changes? A1.When fully implemented, the company expects that these actions will generate incremental annual savings of $0.10 to $0.15 per share before the impact of anticipated increases in pension and other employee benefit costs in 2004 and beyond. Q2. What does the charge include? A2. The approximately $200 million after-tax charge includes: . Reducing total plasma production from 4.6 million liters today to 4.0 million liters (including approximately 1.0 million liters fractionated for the American Red Cross) to enhance the revenue generated per liter. . Closing 26 plasma collection centers (with collections of approximately 450,000 liters) . Closing a fractionation facility in Rochester, Mich., with 700,000 liters of fractionating capacity. . Other reductions in workforce and infrastructure to position the company for increased earnings, cash flow and returns. Q3. Does this announcement affect your BioScience plasma strategy? A3. We continue to focus on maximizing the revenue per liter of plasma we collect and fractionate, while maintaining our industry-leading cost position. Our focus has shifted, though, from capacity expansion to capacity optimization. Given current market conditions, where supply equals or exceeds demand for some fractions, capacity expansion becomes less economical. While the changes we are making will result in lower sales of plasma proteins, over the next four years, we would expect to increase gross margins, cash flow and return on assets. Q4. Does the charge include a write-off of any inventory? What impact will it have on your inventory levels going forward? A4. The charge that was announced today does not include a write-off of any inventory. We expect the plasma products inventory to decline annually beginning in 2004. Q5. What is happening with the Alpha Therapeutic acquisition? - more -
BAXTER ANNOUNCES ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY - PAGE 5 - ---------------------------------------------------------- A5. Since the announcement of our intent to acquire certain Alpha Therapeutic assets, another company has been in negotiations to acquire the remainder of Alpha's assets. While we continue with our negotiations and expect to close the acquisition as quickly as possible, these developments have increased the complexity and changed the timing of closing. Q6. Is this change in guidance related to any changes in your assumptions on ADVATE? A6. No. This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including the effect of economic conditions, actions of regulatory bodies, product development risks, product demand and market acceptance, the impact of competitive products and pricing, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks detailed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by management of the company and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results or experience could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. # # #

On July 17, 2003, Baxter International Inc. issued the attached press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2003 and providing an update on restructuring initiatives. The press release, including attachments, is filed as Exhibit 99.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Date: July 17, 2003
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., July 17, 2003  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its second quarter results, with sales increasing 11 percent and income from continuing operations declining primarily as a result of a previously announced restructuring charge.
 
Sales in the second quarter totaled $2.16 billion, an increase of 11 percent. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales by 5 percent. Baxter's sales within the United States increased 4 percent to $997 million, while sales outside the United States grew 18 percent (including an 11 percent benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.17 billion. In the second quarter, Medication Delivery sales grew 17 percent to $938 million, Renal sales grew 11 percent to $452 million, and BioScience sales grew 5 percent to $773 million.
 
BAXTER'S SALES GROW 11 PERCENT IN SECOND QUARTER - PAGE 2
 
Income from continuing operations totaled $49 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the second quarter, including a special charge resulting from the company's recently announced restructuring plans. The charge totals $337 million, or $202 million after-tax (approximately two-thirds cash and one-third non-cash), or $0.33 per share. This charge includes severance costs for approximately 3,200 employees, representing about 6 percent of Baxter's global workforce, and the write-down of certain facilities. The second quarter results compare to income from continuing operations of $204 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the same period last year, including charges. Cash flows from continuing operations in the second quarter were $228 million, an increase of $144 million from the same period last year.
 
"While our financial results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations, we are confident that our recently announced actions will drive greater profitability, cash flows and shareholder returns over the long term," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Specifically, we are simplifying our infrastructure by consolidating functions and facilities, as well as continuing to prioritize and focus our R&D investments."
 
Restructuring Update
 
Under Baxter's previously announced restructuring plans, approximately 40 percent of reductions in total company positions will be in the United States, with the remaining 60 percent in the rest of the world. Across functional areas, about half of the total workforce reductions are manufacturing-related, with the remainder primarily general and administrative positions.
 
BAXTER'S SALES GROW 11 PERCENT IN SECOND QUARTER - PAGE 3
 
As part of its restructuring initiatives, Baxter is consolidating and integrating certain global facilities, including those in Frankfurt, Germany; Issoire, France; and Mirandola, Italy. While Baxter expects to achieve significant efficiencies as a result of these consolidations, there will be no impact on the company's ability to provide current products to customers. Including the 27 facility closings announced earlier this month, a total of 30 facilities will be shut down.
 
Research and Development Prioritization
 
In addition, Baxter continues to rigorously manage its research and development (R&D) pipeline and R&D assets. Specifically, the company will discontinue its Phase I recombinant hemoglobin protein program because it did not meet the expected clinical results. Baxter is exploring a variety of options for use of its state-of-the-art biotechnology facility in Boulder, Colorado, where the hemoglobin program was based, including a potential sale.
 
Another change resulting from the company's ongoing R&D prioritization efforts is in the vaccines arena. Going forward, Baxter will focus its vaccines business on development programs that utilize its proprietary cell-culture technologies and platforms, including the influenza vaccine. As a result of this decision, Baxter will be consolidating vaccines R&D in California and Austria, and focusing its Maryland operations on manufacturing.
 
Financial Results Year-to-Date
 
Year-to-date, Baxter's sales have grown 9 percent to $4.16 billion, up from the $3.8 billion reported last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales rose 4 percent. BioScience sales rose 2 percent to $1.5 billion, Medication Delivery sales advanced 17 percent to $1.79 billion and Renal sales grew 6 percent to $859 million.
 
BAXTER'S SALES GROW 11 PERCENT IN SECOND QUARTER - PAGE 4
 
Sales within the United States totaled $2.0 billion in the first six months of this year, up 4 percent. Sales outside the United States increased 13 percent (including a 10 percent benefit from foreign exchange), to $2.2 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of this year declined to $266 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, including charges. This compares with $457 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, including charges, reported last year. Year-to-date, Baxter generated $205 million in cash flows from continuing operations, which compares with an outflow of $11 million for the same period last year.
 
2003 Outlook
 
For the third quarter, the company expects to achieve sales growth in the range of 8 to 12 percent and earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $0.45 to $0.50.
 
For the full-year 2003, the company expects to achieve sales growth in the 8 to 10 percent range, earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.75 (including the current quarter $0.33 restructuring charge) and cash flows from continuing operations of approximately $1.2 billion.

Questions and Answers
 
What is the status of ADVATE? Have you received any questions from the FDA or European Regulatory Agencies regarding your submission?
We have received and responded to questions from the regulatory agencies and continue to expect ADVATE (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method) rAHF-PFM approval in the second half of 2003.
 
Does your Q3 guidance include any impact from ADVATE?
We continue to expect ADVATE approval in the second half of this year and have included some sales of ADVATE as one of the many variables for our third quarter guidance. The wider range for the third quarter guidance reflects this possibility.
 
What is the status of Baxter's inventory of Recombinate with distributors? What's happening with your levels of inventory?
Homecare distributor inventory levels of Baxter's Recombinate have fallen to approximately 30-40 days on hand versus over 100 days at the end of 2002. Baxter's own level of Recombinate inventory continues to be approximately 30 days.
 
Does the charge include a write-off of any inventory? What impact will it have on your inventory levels going forward?
The charge does not include a write-off of any inventory. We expect the plasma products inventory to decline annually beginning in 2004.
 
How much will Baxter save as a result of the restructuring changes?
Now that the number of employees and facilities has been determined to be higher, the company expects that these actions will generate incremental annual savings of $0.15 to $0.20 per share when fully implemented, before the impact of anticipated increases in pension and other employee benefit costs in 2004 and beyond.
 
What are your plans for exiting the equity forward agreements?
Given the timing of the restructuring announcement, we decided not to exit the remaining 12 million equity forward agreements in Q2. However, we do expect to be completely out of the equity forward agreements in the third quarter. We do not expect this to have any impact on our EPS estimates for 2003.
 
If the vaccines business is doing well, why are you making changes?
Regardless of whether or not a business is doing well, we continually seek opportunities to enhance their operations. Vaccines is an example of a business we can streamline while it continues to do very well, with sales expectations of approximately $200 million in 2003. We have decided to focus on projects that leverage our proprietary technologies, including the development of our Influenza vaccine. We will also continue with our smallpox contracts and the partnership projects already in place. We are canceling the early-stage conjugate meningitis combination vaccine (CYW) and Group A step vaccine (GAS) projects, which were based on other technology platforms.

What is happening with the Alpha Therapeutic acquisition?
Since the announcement of our intent to acquire certain Alpha Therapeutic assets, another company is acquiring the remainder of Alpha's assets. These developments have increased the complexity and changed the timing of closing. We now expect this transaction to close in the third quarter.

DEERFIELD, Ill., October 16, 2003  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its third quarter results, with sales growth of nine percent and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.47.
 
Sales in the third quarter totaled $2.22 billion, with foreign exchange favorably impacting sales by three percent. Baxter's sales within the United States increased 10 percent to $1.07 billion, while sales outside the United States grew nine percent (including a seven percent benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.15 billion. In the third quarter, Medication Delivery sales grew 16 percent to $948 million, BioScience sales grew 6 percent to $820 million and Renal sales grew 4 percent to $451 million. Contributing to the growth in the quarter were strong sales of anesthesia, biosurgery, drug delivery and IV therapy products and record sales of recombinant clotting factor, which rose 14 percent in the quarter.
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGSPAGE 2
 
Income from continuing operations totaled $278 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the third quarter. The third quarter results compare to income from continuing operations of $317 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
"The third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "The actions we have taken to improve our operational efficiency and simplify our capital structure, together with the launch of new products, position us well to achieve our goals for the year."
 
Recent Highlights
 
During the third quarter, Baxter received FDA approval for the company's innovative hemophilia therapy ADVATE Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM), which offers patients the first and only factor VIII made without any added human or animal plasma proteins or albumin in the cell culture process, purification and final formulation, thereby eliminating the risk of infections caused by viruses that may be carried in these proteins.
 
Also during the third quarter, Baxter's vaccines business was awarded a $10 million contract from the National Institutes of Health for the development of a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Separately, Baxter announced it will collaborate with Avecia, one of Europe's largest privately owned specialty chemical companies and a leader in biotechnology-derived medicines and vaccines, to provide regulatory expertise, commercial services and support and finishing and final packaging of a recombinant anthrax vaccine being developed under a $71 million contract award to Avecia from the U.S. government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

Within its Medication Delivery business, Baxter was awarded contracts in the third quarter from Premier, Inc., the largest alliance of hospitals and health systems in the United States, for Baxter's intravenous solutions, medications and nutrition products, infusion pumps, intravenous tubing and devices, and patient-controlled analgesia products, as well as for anesthesia and critical care products, including generic injectables and inhaled anesthetics.
 
Financial Results Year-to-Date
 
Year-to-date, Baxter's sales grew nine percent to $6.38 billion, up from the $5.85 billion reported last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by five percent. Medication Delivery sales advanced 16 percent to $2.74 billion, BioScience sales rose four percent to $2.33 billion, and Renal sales grew five percent to $1.31 billion. Sales within the United States totaled $3.02 billion in the first nine months of this year, up six percent. Sales outside the United States increased 12 percent (including a nine percent benefit from foreign exchange), to $3.36 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of this year declined to $544 million from $774 million last year, or to $0.90 per diluted share. Year-to-date, Baxter generated $668 million in cash flow from continuing operations, which compares with $458 million for the same period last year.
 
2003 Outlook
 
For the full-year 2003, the company expects to achieve sales growth in the eight to 10 percent range, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.65 to $1.75 and cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.2 billion.

Questions and Answers
 
What impact does the lawsuit filed this week have on Baxter's relationship with Cerus Corporation?
This lawsuit does not affect our current development and commercialization agreements with Cerus. Baxter Capital Corporation filed a lawsuit against Cerus Corporation seeking repayment of Cerus' loan because they are in default. The collateral for the loan was based on revenue projections for Cerus that have not been met.
 
What is the status of your ADVATE launch?
Since the late August U.S. launch of ADVATE, sales in the third quarter totaled approximately $11 million. In Europe, we anticipate a positive opinion for marketing authorization from the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), before the end of the year. Typically, final approval notification is received 90 days following CPMP positive opinion.
 
What is the status of your equity forward agreements?
During the third quarter, all of the remaining equity forward agreements were settled. This was accomplished with the completion of an equity offering of 22 million shares of common stock, from which Baxter used a portion of the proceeds to settle all remaining equity forward agreements.
 
What were the accounting changes in the third quarter?
Baxter adopted two new accounting standards on July 1, 2003. The non-cash cumulative effect of these accounting changes, as of July 1, 2003, reduced Q3 net income by $17 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.
 
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46) requires the consolidation of certain entities by companies that do not control those entities, and FASB 150 changes the classification of certain financial instruments from stockholders' equity to liabilities. With the adoption of FIN 46, approximately $165 million of our synthetic leases, which principally relate to certain office space and plasma centers, are now on the balance sheet. With the

adoption of FASB 150, the equity forward agreements relating to Baxter common stock were also included on the balance sheet. The company settled the remaining equity forward agreements during the third quarter.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., December 23, 2003Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) said today that, based on preliminary estimates, it expects earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2003 to be lower than the company's previously announced guidance.
 
For the fourth quarter 2003, the company expects sales growth to be in the 8 to 10 percent range, given the positive growth trends for its recombinant factor VIII and Medication Delivery products. The company now expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. While Baxter expects its gross margin in the fourth quarter to improve slightly from the third quarter, earnings per diluted share are expected to be impacted by unfavorable geographic mix and lower than expected gains from the sale of assets. The new range for earnings per diluted share includes a gain of $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of its investment in Acambis, a UK-based developer of vaccines.
 
BAXTER ANNOUNCES CHANGE TO EARNINGS GUIDANCEPAGE 2
 
For the full year 2003, the company's guidance for sales growth remains in the 8 to 10 percent range. However, the company now expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $1.52 to $1.55, including the second quarter restructuring charge of $0.33 per diluted share and the gain from the sale of the company's stake in Acambis. Cash flow from continuing operations remains on track and is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion after contributing $85 million to the company's pension trusts in 2003.
 
The company will summarize its fourth quarter and full year 2003 financial performance and outline actions to enhance profitability and cash flow going forward during its previously scheduled earnings conference call on January 29, 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., April 22, 2004Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its financial results for the first quarter, with sales increasing 11 percent and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaling $0.31, compared to the company's guidance of $0.28 to $0.31 per diluted share.
 
Baxter's sales totaled $2.21 billion in the first quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting sales by 7 percentage points. Sales within the United States grew 7 percent to $1.02 billion, while sales outside the United States grew 14 percent (including a 12 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.19 billion. Sales from Baxter's BioScience business increased 9 percent to $810 million, while the company's Medication Delivery business grew 9 percent in the first quarter to $929 million, and Renal sales grew 16 percent to $470 million.
 
Income from continuing operations totaled $189 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, down from the $217 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, reported last year.

"While organic sales growth was in line with our expectations, we need to take further actions to realign our cost structure to drive greater profitability," said Brian P. Anderson, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "Therefore, we will implement a number of additional initiatives to better leverage our resources, with a focus on standardizing and consolidating work processes and reducing capacity in our plasma business, in order to drive sustainable improvements in our financial performance."
 
As announced in January 2004, Baxter plans to begin implementing additional actions to reduce costs. These actions will include the elimination of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 additional positions, or approximately 7 to 8 percent of Baxter's current global workforce. About half of the positions to be eliminated are located in the United States, and half located outside the United States, with nearly three-quarters of the savings within general and administrative expenses. While the market for plasma-derived products has stabilized, the company intends to further enhance profitability and cash flow by adjusting its plasma production. Accordingly, Baxter plans to reduce plasma production by 400,000 liters, or 13 percent, annually and close additional plasma collection centers.
 
The company anticipates that it will record an after-tax charge in the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $350 to $400 million, or $0.55 to $0.65 per diluted share, principally for severance and costs associated with the closing of facilities. Baxter expects that these additional initiatives will yield savings of $0.05 per diluted share in the second half of 2004, $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share in 2005, and $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share when fully implemented in 2006.

Looking forward to the second quarter, the company expects its sales growth to be between 4 to 6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $0.37 to $0.41 excluding the impact of the 2004 restructuring charges and benefits. For full-year 2004, Baxter expects sales growth to be between 3 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Baxter also expects to achieve earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.75 to $1.85, excluding the impact of the 2004 restructuring charges and benefits, and to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.5 billion.
 
Related Questions and Answers
 
What is the status of the Advate launch? What were Advate sales in the first quarter?
 
Baxter received clearance from regulatory authorities in Europe in March, and has launched Advate in Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. Advate contributed $27 million in sales to the total of $292 million in recombinant sales in the first quarter, helping grow that product line by 19 percent. With the European launch now well underway, Baxter expects Advate sales in the second quarter to be significantly higher. The company anticipates that full-year sales of Advate will total $200 to $300 million, and expects to take further actions to accelerate conversion to the product.
 
What is the status of Baxter's 2003 restructuring initiative?
 
In July 2003, Baxter announced a number of initiatives aimed at generating approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in annual savings. These initiatives
 
BAXTER REPORTS 1
ST
QUARTER RESULTS/Page 4
 
involved the closing and/or consolidation of a number of facilities worldwide, elimination of approximately 3,000 positions worldwide, and changes in its plasma operations that reduced plasma production by 600,000 liters and closed 26 plasma collection centers across the United States. The company is on track in implementing these initiatives, and has eliminated approximately 85 percent of the positions and generated savings of $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter 2004.
 
How much of the anticipated second quarter 2004 restructuring charge will be cash versus non-cash?
 
Baxter expects that approximately two-thirds of the charge will be cash (primarily for severance payments) and one-third of the charge will be non-cash (for write-offs of fixed assets).

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 22, 2004, Baxter International Inc. issued the attached press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2004, announcing plans to restate its financial results for the years 2001 through 2003 and for the first quarter of 2004, and revising guidance for full-year 2004. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference. The company includes various non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, including earnings per diluted share from continuing operations excluding the special charges described in the press release. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual. The company's management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: July 22, 2004
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., July 22, 2004  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its financial results for the second quarter. The company reported a loss from continuing operations of $169 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, which includes after-tax charges of $414 million, or $0.68 per diluted share related to the 2004 restructuring initiatives and other items detailed below. Excluding these special charges, earnings from continuing operations totaled $245 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, which is within the range of the company's previous guidance for the quarter of $0.37 to $0.41 per diluted share.
 
Given the company's announced plans to restate its financial results, all comparisons in this news release to prior quarters or years do not reflect the effects of the restatement.
 
Baxter's sales totaled $2.4 billion in the second quarter, increasing 10 percent over the prior year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales by 4 percentage points in the quarter. Sales within the United States grew 10 percent to $1.1 billion, while
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - PAGE 2
 
sales outside the United States grew 10 percent (including a 7 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.3 billion. Sales from Baxter's BioScience business increased 16 percent to $893 million, including ADVATE Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM) sales of $51 million during the quarter. The company's Medication Delivery business increased 7 percent in the second quarter to $1 billion, and Renal sales increased 6 percent to $480 million.
 
"We saw solid performance across all of our businesses during the second quarter with strong sales of ADVATE, particularly in Europe where the product is still being introduced across the region," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite special charges that impacted earnings and the restatement to our financials, I am confident that we are taking the right steps to strengthen the performance of our company and our businesses."
 
Restructuring Initiatives
 
As previously announced in January 2004, the company is implementing a number of initiatives to drive sustainable improvements in financial performance. These actions include the elimination of approximately 4,000 positions, or eight percent of Baxter's current global workforce. Approximately 50 percent of the positions being eliminated are located in the United States. Approximately three-quarters of the estimated savings are within general and administrative expenses.
 
In addition, consistent with the company's previously announced plans, plasma production has been reduced by an additional 400,000 liters, or 13 percent, on an annual basis and additional plasma collection centers have been closed to further enhance the future profitability and cash flow of the company's plasma business.
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - PAGE 3
 
As a result of these actions, the company recorded an after-tax charge in the second quarter of $394 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, which is in line with previously announced expectations. Approximately 60 percent of the charge is cash, principally related to severance payments, and 40 percent is non-cash and relates primarily to costs associated with the closing of facilities. As previously announced, Baxter expects that these initiatives will yield savings of $0.05 per diluted share in the second half of 2004, $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share in 2005, and $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share when fully implemented in 2006.
 
Other Charges
 
In addition to the restructuring charge, during the second quarter the company recorded an after-tax, non-cash charge of $20 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to other items, including adjustments to receivable and inventory reserves, certain hedged positions, and asset impairments. These adjustments, which totaled approximately $115 million on a pre-tax basis, were reduced by the reversal into income of tax reserves of approximately $55 million as a result of tax audits completed in the second quarter.
 
"While the results for the quarter from an operational perspective met our expectations, special charges have negatively impacted our earnings," said John J. Greisch, chief financial officer. "Going forward, I am confident that our strong cash flow and a disciplined approach will provide us with the opportunity to strengthen our financial position, and enable us to focus on implementing our business strategies to secure a strong future for the company."
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - PAGE 4
 
Restatement of Financials
 
The company also announced that it plans to restate its financial results for the years 2001 through 2003, and for the first quarter of 2004. The restatement is primarily the result of incorrect revenue recognition and inadequate provisions for bad debts in Brazil during that period, which will result in a decrease in net income over the restatement period by an amount expected to be no more than $40 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. The restatement is expected to result in adjustments to sales over the period of an amount not more than $70 million, representing less than 0.5 percent of sales in any year.
 
Greisch added, "While the adjustments to any of the individual years subject to restatement may not seem significant to Baxter's overall operations, the company concluded that a restatement is the most appropriate action."
 
Upon becoming aware of the issue in Brazil, senior management, with the assistance of the company's internal audit team, conducted a preliminary investigation, which was followed by a more comprehensive investigation by the Audit Committee of Baxter's Board of Directors with the assistance of external legal counsel and accountants. As a result of those investigations, two members of senior management in the company's Brazilian operations are being terminated. In addition, the company has looked for similar issues within its Latin America region and, aside from some minor issues in one other country, no similar issues have surfaced.
 
"The situation we discovered in Brazil was very troubling and we took it very seriously," Parkinson said. "We will not tolerate noncompliance with company policy or with the company's code of business conduct. We are committed to having strong leadership and a disciplined control environment in all of our operations on a worldwide basis."
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - PAGE 5
 
As a result of the restatement, previously issued financial statements for the period from 2001 through the first quarter of 2004 should no longer be relied upon. Details of the company's restatements will be reported in its second quarter 10-Q filing.
 
Future Outlook
 
For full-year 2004, Baxter expects reported sales growth to be between 5 to 7 percent with sales on an organic basis of 3 to 4 percent. Baxter expects 2004 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.96 to $1.03, inclusive of special charges in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of special charges in the second quarter, the company expects to achieve earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.65 to $1.72. The company also expects to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.4 billion. The company is reducing guidance for the year based primarily on lower earnings expectations in Brazil, reduced wholesaler inventory levels, and the impact of additional exposure of foreign exchange on earnings.
 
The company expects its organic sales growth to be between 3 to 5 percent in the third quarter, and flat compared to the prior year for the fourth quarter. For the second half of the year, at current rates foreign currency is expected to benefit sales growth by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations is expected to be $0.41 to $0.44 for the third quarter, and $0.54 to $0.58 for the fourth quarter.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant.
 
On September 29, 2004, Baxter International Inc. (the "Company") entered into a five-year $800 million syndicated credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and other financial institutions named therein. The new $800 million credit facility, which terminates on September 29, 2009, replaces the Company's 364-day $760 million syndicated credit facility which terminated on September 29, 2004. In addition to the new $800 million credit facility, the Company also maintains a $640 million credit facility entered into on October 3, 2002 which expires on October 3, 2007.
 
Both the new $800 million credit facility and the $640 million credit facility enable the Company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis in United States Dollars, Euros or Swiss Francs at variable interest rates, and contain customary covenants, including a maximum net-debt-to-capital ratio of 55% and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0. For purposes of the maximum net-debt-to-capital ratio, both credit facilities give 70% equity credit to the Company's equity units.
 
There are no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.
 
Some of the lenders under these credit facilities and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, securitization, and leasing services. In addition, the Company has entered into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements with some of the lenders and their affiliates.
 
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On September 28, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved amendments to the Company's Bylaws. In Article II, Section 4, the term "electronic transmission" was substituted for "telegram"; in Article IV, Sections 1 and 6, the title "Group Vice President," which is no longer used, was replaced with "Corporate Vice President"; and in Article VIII, Section 5 provisions were added to provide for electronic transmission of notice requirements and householding.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to of the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of September 29, 2004 (the "") among Baxter International Inc. (the ""), the Banks parties thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Section 6.01(d)
Credit Agreement
Borrower
 
I am General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
 
In that connection I have examined:
 
(1) The Credit Agreement.
 
(2) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
Charter
 
(3) The by-laws of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
By-laws
 
(4) Certificates of the Secretaries of State of Delaware, dated , , and Illinois, dated , , each attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in such State.
                    
            
                    
            
 
(5) All of the other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.01
 
I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the documents listed in a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Borrower, dated the date hereof (the "") and attached hereto as , certifying that the documents listed in such certificate are all of the indentures, loan or credit agreements, leases, mortgages, security agreements, bonds, notes and other agreements or instruments, and all of the orders, writs,
Certificate
Exhibit A
 
judgments, awards, injunctions and decrees, which affect or purport to affect the Borrower's right to borrow money or the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Notes. In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.
 
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any document, order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree listed in the Certificate or, to the best of my knowledge, contained in any other similar document or any other order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. If a Borrowing were to occur on this date in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and assuming the statements made in of the Credit Agreement remained true and correct after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Borrowing, such Borrowing would not violate Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Section 7.01(h)
 
3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
 
4. The Credit Agreement and the Notes are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
5. There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
 
6. The Borrower is not (i) an "investment company," (ii) a company "controlled" by an "investment company" which is registered under the Investment Company
 
Act of 1940, as amended, or (iii) to the best of my knowledge, a company "controlled" by any other "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
 
(b) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
(c) I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes, (ii) or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

I am aware that Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP will rely upon the statements in this opinion (other than paragraph 4) in rendering their opinion furnished pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.01
 
The opinions expressed above are based solely on factual matters in existence as of the date hereof and laws and regulations in effect on the date hereof. I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion letter should such factual matters change or should such laws or regulations be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise.

To the Banks parties to the Credit
    Agreement and Listed on Schedule I hereto:
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Baxter International Inc. (the "") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of September 29, 2004 (the "") among the Borrower, the banks parties thereto (the "") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the ""). All capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.
Borrower
Credit Agreement
Banks
Administrative Agent
 
In that connection we have reviewed the following documents:
 
(1) Counterparts of the Credit Agreement, purportedly executed by each of the parties thereto; and
 
(2) The opinion of [], General Counsel of the Borrower, and the other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
                                         
Section 6.01
 
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the parties executing such documents, and the conformity to the originals of such documents submitted to us as copies. We have assumed that each of the Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, in each case with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise). To the extent that our opinions expressed below involve conclusions as to the matters set forth in the opinion of counsel referred to in item (2) above, we have assumed without independent investigation the correctness of the opinions set forth therein (other than the opinion set forth in paragraph 4 thereof). In addition, we have assumed that there are no written or oral terms or conditions agreed to by the Borrower, and any or all of the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Banks which could vary the truth, completeness, correctness, validity or effect of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination of documents and the assumptions set forth herein and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion
 
that, under the law of the State of New York, the Credit Agreement and the Notes are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
Our opinion is subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith.
 
(b) Our opinion is limited to the internal (as opposed to conflicts of laws) laws of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect upon the obligations of the Borrower of (i) any law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought or (ii) the legal status of any of the Banks.
 
(c) We express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes or (ii) or , insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent.
Sections 5.17
11.05
Section 5.15(c)
11.04(c)
 
This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without our specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
 
The opinions expressed above are based solely on factual matters in existence as of the date hereof and laws and regulations in effect on the date hereof. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion letter should such factual matters change or should such laws or regulations be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to of the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of October 3, 2002 (the "") among Baxter International Inc. (the ""), the Banks parties thereto and Bank One, NA, as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Section 6.01(d)
Credit Agreement
Borrower
 
I am General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
 
In that connection I have examined:
 
(1) The Credit Agreement.
 
(2) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
Charter
 
(3) The by-laws of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
By-laws
 
(4) Certificates of the Secretaries of State of Delaware, dated , , and Illinois, dated , , each attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in such State.
            
    
            
    
 
(5) All of the other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.01
 
I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the documents listed in a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Borrower, dated the date hereof (the "") and attached hereto as , certifying that the documents listed in such certificate are all of the indentures, loan or credit agreements, leases, mortgages, security agreements, bonds, notes and other agreements or instruments, and all of the orders, writs,
Certificate
Exhibit A
 
judgments, awards, injunctions and decrees, which affect or purport to affect the Borrower's right to borrow money or the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Notes. In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.
 
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any document, order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree listed in the Certificate or, to the best of my knowledge, contained in any other similar document or any other order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. If a Borrowing were to occur on this date in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and assuming the statements made in of the Credit Agreement remained true and correct after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Borrowing, such Borrowing would not violate Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Section 7.01(h)
 
3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
 
4. The Credit Agreement and the Notes are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
5. There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
 
6. The Borrower is not (i) an "investment company," (ii) a company "controlled" by an "investment company" which is registered under the Investment Company
 
Act of 1940, as amended, or (iii) to the best of my knowledge, a company "controlled" by any other "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
 
(b) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
(c) I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes, (ii) or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

    Agreement and Listed on Schedule I hereto:
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Baxter International Inc. (the "") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of October 3, 2002 (the "") among the Borrower, the banks parties thereto (the "") and Bank One, NA, as Administrative Agent (the ""). All capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.
Borrower
Credit Agreement
Banks
Administrative Agent
 
In that connection we have reviewed the following documents:
 
(1) Counterparts of the Credit Agreement, purportedly executed by each of the parties thereto; and
 
(2) The opinion of Thomas J. Sabatino, Jr., General Counsel of the Borrower, and the other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.01
 
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the parties executing such documents, and the conformity to the originals of such documents submitted to us as copies. We have assumed that each of the Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, in each case with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise). To the extent that our opinions expressed below involve conclusions as to the matters set forth in the opinion of counsel referred to in item (2) above, we have assumed without independent investigation the correctness of the opinions set forth therein (other than the opinion set forth in paragraph 4 thereof). In addition, we have assumed that there are no written or oral terms or conditions agreed to by the Borrower, and any or all of the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Banks which could vary the truth, completeness, correctness, validity or effect of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination of documents and the assumptions set forth herein and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion
 
that, under the law of the State of Illinois, the Credit Agreement and the Notes are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
Our opinion is subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith.
 
(b) Our opinion is limited to the internal (as opposed to conflicts of laws) laws of the State of Illinois, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect upon the obligations of the Borrower of (i) any law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought or (ii) the legal status of any of the Banks.
 
(c) We express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes or (ii) or , insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent.
Sections 5.17
11.05

This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without our specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
 
The opinions expressed above are based solely on factual matters in existence as of the date hereof and laws and regulations in effect on the date hereof.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 21, 2004, Baxter International Inc. issued the attached press release reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2004. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference. The company includes various non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, including income from continuing operations excluding the special charges referred to in the press release and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations excluding the special charges referred to in the press release. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual. The company's management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: October 21, 2004
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., October 21, 2004  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its results for the third quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaled $0.42 in the quarter, a decline of 9 percent from $0.46 per share reported last year, and in line with the company's expectations.
 
Sales advanced 5 percent to $2.32 billion in the third quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting sales by 3 percentage points. Sales within the United States increased 3 percent to $1.10 billion. International sales totaled $1.22 billion, an increase of 6 percent, resulting entirely from favorable foreign exchange.
 
In the third quarter, BioScience sales increased 4 percent, to $849 million, Medication Delivery sales grew 4 percent to $986 million, and Renal sales grew 8 percent to $485 million.
 
The company's restructuring initiatives continued to drive improvement in margins. Baxter's gross margin of 41.5 percent and operating margin of 16.3 percent reflect continued sequential improvement throughout 2004.
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS  Page 2
 
"We are pleased with the meaningful progress we have made on multiple fronts," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition to achieving our key financial objectives, we exceeded expectations for Advate, achieved all of the milestones associated with the restructuring program, and made significant progress in building our senior leadership team with several important appointments."
 
Year-to-Date Results
 
For the first nine months of 2004, Baxter's sales grew 8 percent to $6.91 billion, up from $6.37 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 4 percentage points year-to-date. Sales within the United States totaled $3.22 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the same period last year. International sales increased 10 percent (including an 8 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), totaling $3.69 billion.
 
Year-to-date, BioScience sales increased 9 percent to $2.55 billion, fueled by sales of ADVATE Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, which totaled $85 million in the third quarter, and are expected to exceed $250 million for the full-year. ADVATE has been widely accepted by patients and clinicians since its approval in July 2003 in the U.S., and March 2004 in Europe. In the third quarter, Baxter also filed for European regulatory approval of the company's next-generation immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) therapy for the treatment of primary immune deficiency disease, following the company's second quarter regulatory submission in the U.S.
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS  Page 3
 
In its other business segments, year-to-date Medication Delivery sales increased approximately 7 percent to $2.92 billion, and Renal sales advanced 10 percent to $1.44 billion.
 
"We have a solid foundation in place, with market-leading products and strong business franchises. Our focus now is on improving the financial vitality of the company, providing greater flexibility over time to make strategic investments that further expand and diversify our business," Parkinson added.
 
Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $277 million in the first nine months of the year. Excluding second-quarter special charges, the company reported year-to-date income from continuing operations of $691 million, a decrease of 6 percent over the same period last year. Year-to-date earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaled $0.45, or $1.12 excluding the second-quarter charges.
 
Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations totaled $529 million, after funding $231 million for restructuring payments and pension contributions. Capital expenditures for the nine-month period declined by more than $200 million to $363 million in 2004, from $564 million in 2003.
 
"We are continuing to focus our efforts on aggressively managing cash flow, including a more disciplined approach toward capital spending," said John Greisch, chief financial officer. "I am pleased with the improvement in year-to-date cash flow, and am confident that further improvements in working capital management will yield consistent and sustainable cash flow in the future."
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS  Page 4
 
2004 Outlook
 
Consistent with the company's previous guidance, Baxter expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $0.54 to $0.58 for the fourth quarter, and $0.99 to $1.03 for the full-year, inclusive of special charges in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of second-quarter special charges, the company expects to achieve full-year earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.66 to $1.70.
 
The company expects its reported sales for the fourth quarter to be flat versus the prior year, resulting in full-year sales growth between 5 to 6 percent, including foreign exchange benefit of 3 to 4 percentage points.
 
Baxter also expects to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.4 billion for full-year 2004.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant
 
The response to Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.06 Material Impairments
 
As previously announced on December 9, 2004, the Company suspended enrollment in the Phase II/III clinical study in Europe of its PreFluCel influenza vaccine. Management of the Company determined that as a result of expected delays in launching the product, during which time the Company would be incurring operating expenses as well as R&D costs, the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets related to the flu vaccine will be substantially less than the $226 million net book value of the assets. On January 6, 2005 management of the Company, in consultation with the Company's Audit Committee, concluded that a material charge for impairment of the Company's flu vaccine assets is required to be recorded during the fourth quarter of 2004 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Accordingly, the Company will record a non-cash, after-tax charge of approximately $170 million for the write-down of certain assets related to its flu vaccine program.
In addition, management of the Company decided in December 2004 not to fund further development of technology acquired in 2001 for the development of an erythropoietin drug (EPOMAX) for the treatment of anemia beyond the currently ongoing clinical trials. Due to the resulting uncertainty of successful commercialization of the product, on January 6, 2005 management of the Company, in consultation with the Company's Audit Committee, concluded that a material charge for impairment of the Company's assets is required to be recorded during the fourth quarter of 2004 in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the Company will record a non-cash, after-tax charge of approximately $45 million for the write-down of the intellectual property acquired and a related manufacturing facility.
 
Also, as a result of manufacturing process improvements at the Company's Neuchtel, Switzerland facility, and the existing manufacturing capacity available at Thousand Oaks, California where the Company's Recombinate Antihemophilic Factor product is produced, the Company determined in December 2004 that the additional capacity of the "Suite D" facility at Thousand Oaks is not needed and has decided to keep Suite D fully decommissioned for the foreseeable future. On January 6, 2005 management of the Company, in consultation with the Company's Audit Committee, concluded that a material charge for impairment of the Company's assets is required to be recorded during the fourth quarter of 2004 in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the Company will record a non-cash, after-tax charge of approximately $30 million for the write-down of excess recombinant manufacturing assets relating to the "Suite D" facility.
 
Each of these non-cash impairment charges was determined in connection with the Company's quarterly asset impairment review and in conjunction with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. None of the above-mentioned impairment charges will result in incremental future cash expenditures.

No delay on the part of the Agent or the Banks in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Agent or the Banks of any right, power or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof; nor shall any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon the Agent or the Banks, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered on the Banks' behalf of the Agent.

The Guarantor agrees that the foregoing representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made by the Guarantor on the date of this Guaranty and on the date of each Borrowing Notice (except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date) with respect to each Advance under the Credit Agreement on and as of such Borrowing Date.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On January 27, 2005, Baxter International Inc. issued the attached press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004 and providing financial guidance for the full year 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) income from continuing operations excluding the restructuring and impairment charges referred to in the press release; (ii) earnings per diluted share from continuing operations excluding the restructuring and impairment charges referred to in the press release to adjust for factors that are unusual; and (iii) free cash flow as defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures. The company's management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by excluding certain charges that may not be indicative of the company's core operating results, which allows investors to better evaluate the company's ongoing business performance and by informing investors of the cash available for acquisitions and financing activities. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance. Management encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

DEERFIELD, ILL. January 27, 2005  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Income from continuing operations totaled $106 million, including a $245 million non-cash, after-tax asset impairment charge the company announced earlier this month related to its influenza vaccine program and other assets. Income from continuing operations per diluted share totaled $0.17. Excluding the asset impairment charge, earnings from continuing operations were $351 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.57 per diluted share, in line with the company's expectations.
 
Worldwide sales in the fourth quarter totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). Domestic sales declined 1 percent to $1.2 billion, and international sales grew 7 percent (including a 6 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.4 billion.
 
"We are very pleased with the progress made throughout 2004. We established a new executive management team, improved the company's cost structure

by successfully executing the restructuring plans, and demonstrated our ability to set realistic objectives and deliver on them," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "The focus on disciplined, operational execution is clearly yielding solid and substantive results."
 
Full-Year 2004 Results
 
Baxter's income from continuing operations for full-year 2004 totaled $383 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, including restructuring and other special charges. Excluding the charges, Baxter reported 2004 income from continuing operations of $1.042 billion, or $1.69 per diluted share.
 
Cash flow from continuing operations totaled approximately $1.4 billion. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures) for the full-year increased $181 million to $814 million. Capital spending of $558 million declined 30 percent compared to 2003, and the company reduced net debt by $464 million, resulting in a net-debt-to-capital ratio of 34.2 percent compared to 39.9 percent in the prior year.
 
"In 2004 we focused on meeting commitments, strengthening the balance sheet and improving the overall quality of earnings and cash flow," said John Greisch, chief financial officer.

2004 to $4.5 billion, and international sales grew 9 percent (including a 7 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $5.0 billion.
 
Full-year sales for Baxter's BioScience business totaled $3.5 billion, an increase of 7 percent (including a 4 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), driven by strong growth of the company's recombinant Factor VIII products. Recombinant sales totaled $1.3 billion in 2004, an increase of 18 percent over 2003, and included $286 million in sales of ADVATE Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM), which has now been launched in the U.S. and 12 European countries.
 
Medication Delivery sales totaled $4.0 billion in 2004, an increase of 6 percent (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), driven by strong growth in the company's drug delivery business unit. Renal sales advanced 8 percent (including a 4 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $2.0 billion, led primarily by strong international sales of peritoneal dialysis products.
 
Financial Guidance for 2005
 
Baxter also announced today its financial guidance for full-year 2005, with organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent. Sales growth for 2005 reflects the company's decision to exit certain low margin businesses, which is expected to negatively impact sales growth by approximately 1 percent, or $125 million. The company expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $1.82 to $1.90. Baxter also expects to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.5 billion, or free cash flow of approximately $900 million in 2005 (after $600 million of anticipated capital expenditures).
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4TH QUARTER RESULTS  Page 4
 
For the first quarter of 2005, the company expects organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.33 to $0.35.
 
The company's guidance does not include the effect of any potential future decision to repatriate foreign earnings relating to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the effect of new accounting rules requiring the expensing of stock options.
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently reissued FASB Statement No. 123 "ShareBased Payment," which covers stock options, as well as other sharebased compensation arrangements. The company expects to begin expensing stock options effective July 1, 2005, in accordance with the requirements of FASB Statement No. 123 and will provide the expected impact of this change on its second quarter earnings conference call in July 2005.

In some cases, certain unusual or non-recurring items can be so significant as to obscure patterns and trends of the company's business in total. The non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures contained in this press release (including the presentation above of earnings and per-share earnings, excluding certain items) adjust for factors that are unusual or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance.

As further discussed in the company's SEC filings, during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company executed offsetting or mirror swaps relating to approximately 58% of the portfolio. These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On March 14, 2005, Baxter International Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that it would restate its financial statements for the years 2001 through 2003 and for the first three quarters of 2004 as a result of income tax accounting errors affecting balance sheet accounts only. The situation arises primarily from errors related to income tax accounting for periods prior to 2001 and from classification errors of certain income tax and other related balance sheet accounts. In addition to reclassification of certain income tax balance sheet accounts for 2001 through 2003, the net effect of the restatement will be to increase the Company's previously reported stockholders' equity for the years 2001 through 2003 by approximately $108 million. Stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2004, as previously reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 27, 2005, will be increased by approximately $130 million as a result of the restatement. The restatement will not affect the Company's reported tax rates for the affected years, or the anticipated tax rate for 2005, nor will it affect the Company's business prospects or earnings outlook for 2005 and beyond. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02. This Current Report on Form 8-K and the press release contain statements intended as "forward-looking statements" which are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements set forth in the press release.
 
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
 
On March 14, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company concluded that the previously issued financial statements for the years 2001 through 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 should not be relied upon because of errors in those financial statements and that the Company would restate these financial statements to make the necessary accounting corrections. The subject matter giving rise to this conclusion was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
 
The restatement, which will be effected through an amendment to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, relates to income tax accounting errors affecting balance sheet accounts only for these periods, and does not affect the Company's previously reported revenue, cash flow, net income or earnings per share for those periods.
 
All necessary corrections and restated financial statements for the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 are expected to be completed to allow the Company to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. Amendments to the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 are expected to be filed in the near future.
 
A copy of the Company's press release issued March 14, 2005 is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item 4.02.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., March 14, 2005  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) announced today that it intends to restate its financial statements for the years 2001 through 2003, and for the first three quarters of 2004. The restatement is limited to income tax accounting errors affecting the company's balance sheet, and does not affect the company's previously reported revenue, net income, earnings per share or cash flow for those periods. The restatement will not affect Baxter's reported tax rates for the affected years, or the anticipated tax rate for 2005, nor will it affect the company's business prospects or earnings outlook for 2005.
 
This situation arises primarily from errors related to income tax accounting for periods prior to 2001, and from classification errors of certain income tax and other related balance sheet accounts. In addition to reclassification of certain income tax balance sheet accounts for 2001 through 2003, the net effect of the restatement will be an increase to the company's previously reported stockholders' equity for the years 2001 through 2003 of approximately $108 million. Stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2004, as previously reported in the company's Current Report on Form
 
BAXTER TO RESTATE  Page 2
 
8-K filed January 27, 2005, will be increased by approximately $130 million as a result of this restatement.
 
"We have devoted significant resources over the last year to assessing, and strengthening where appropriate, our controls in the context of the Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 review," said John J. Greisch, Baxter's chief financial officer. "We have identified and corrected the errors in classification of certain income tax and other related balance sheet accounts as part of our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 work, and we are confident that we have strengthened the processes and controls for the accounting for income taxes."
 
As a result of the income tax accounting errors, the company has determined that it had an internal control deficiency that constitutes a "material weakness" as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 2. This is the only material weakness that was identified during the company's review of its internal control system. As a result of this material weakness, management will be unable to conclude that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Therefore, the company's external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, will issue an adverse opinion with respect to the company's internal control over financial reporting. As will be reported in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, Baxter's management believes that the material weakness relating to accounting for income taxes that existed as of December 31, 2004, will be remediated as a result of processes that have been implemented subsequent to December 31, 2004.
 
BAXTER TO RESTATE  Page 3
 
As a result of the restatement, previously issued financial statements for 2001 through the third quarter of 2004 should no longer be relied upon. Details of the restatement for 2001 through 2003 will be reflected in an Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, which the company will file today. Amendments to the company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for 2004 will be filed in the near future. The company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, by March 16, 2005.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 21, 2005, Baxter International Inc. issued the attached press release reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2005 and reiterating financial guidance for full-year 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The press release contains a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures, is not a measure defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow provides the company with the flexibility to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions. Management encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., April 21, 2005 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its results for the first quarter of 2005.
 
Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 20 percent to $0.36, compared to $0.30 reported last year. Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $224 million for the quarter, compared to $187 million reported in the same period last year. Contributing to the growth in earnings were strong sales, improved gross margins and cost savings related to the company's restructuring program.
 
Worldwide sales in the first quarter totaled $2.38 billion, an increase of 8 percent over the same period last year (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). Domestic sales increased 2 percent to $1.04 billion, while international sales grew 13 percent (including a 6 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.34 billion. In addition to the positive impact of foreign exchange, strong performance in the company's BioScience business was the primary contributor to sales growth in the quarter. In particular, sales in Baxter's recombinant business grew 18 percent to $344 million, which includes $117 million relating to
 
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/Page 2
 
ADVATE , the company's Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) product for the treatment of hemophilia A. Medication Delivery's infusion systems and drug delivery businesses also contributed to the company's sales growth in the quarter.
 
"Our first quarter financial results reflect the value inherent in our business, and our ability to deliver on our commitment of increasing earnings at a faster pace than sales growth," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Our focus on disciplined operational execution and emphasis on improving the performance of each of our businesses is clearly yielding substantive financial results for the company, in line with our expectations."
 
Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $271 million for the quarter, compared to an outflow of $53 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $65 million) was $206 million for the quarter, an improvement of $349 million compared to the first quarter last year.
 
"We are very pleased with the significant improvement in free cash flow for the quarter," said John J. Greisch, chief financial officer. "During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to our U.S. pension fund and we settled $254 million of the net investment hedge obligation. We are making good progress in improving our cash flow, which enables us to deal effectively with several balance sheet issues from the past."

Baxter reiterated its financial guidance for full-year 2005, with organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.82 to $1.90. Baxter also expects to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.5 billion, or free cash flow of approximately $900 million in 2005 (after approximately $600 million of anticipated capital expenditures). The company's guidance does not include the effect of any potential future decision to repatriate foreign earnings relating to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
 
For the second quarter of 2005, the company expects organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.43 to $0.45.

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, including: the company's ability to realize in a timely manner the anticipated benefits of restructuring initiatives; the effect of economic conditions; the impact of geographic and/or product mix on the company's sales; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration and foreign counterparts that could delay, limit or suspend product sales and distribution; product quality and/or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays or declining sales; product development risks; interest rates; technological advances in the medical field; demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; foreign currency exchange rates; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; global regulatory, trade and tax policies; regulatory, legal or other developments relating to the company's A, AF and AX series dialyzers; the ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable cost; the ability to enforce patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; internal and external factors that could impact commercialization; results of product testing; and other risks detailed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions within the bounds of management's knowledge of the company's business and operations, but there can be no assurance that the actual results or performance of the company will conform to any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Actual results could differ materially from such statements. Please refer to Baxter's Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on Baxter's website, for more details concerning important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. The company disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements and all such statements speak only as of the time when made. This news release contains a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures, is not a measure defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of this measure is included in this news release.

As further discussed in the company's SEC filings, during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company executed offsetting or mirror swaps. These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At March 31, 2005, 54% of the portfolio was mirrored.
Note:
 
During the first quarter of 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $254 million. In accordance with GAAP, $312 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $58 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.

Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 21, 2005, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.
 
The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding certain items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets.
 
The release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS/Page 2
 
The second-quarter results include a $0.03 per diluted share benefit from a year-to-date tax adjustment, as the company adjusted its income tax rate to the anticipated 2005 full-year rate of 22 percent. This rate reflects savings related to a change in estimate of the company's tax rate due to ongoing improvements to the company's geographic product sourcing strategy.
 
Worldwide sales in the second quarter totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of 8 percent over the same period last year (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). Domestic sales increased 6 percent to $1.2 billion, while international sales grew 11 percent (including a 7 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.4 billion. In addition to the positive impact of foreign exchange, strong performance from the company's recombinant and drug delivery businesses contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Sales of Baxter's recombinant products grew 24 percent to $397 million, including $148 million in sales of ADVATE, the company's Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) product for the treatment of hemophilia A.
 
Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $508 million for the quarter, compared to $305 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $98 million in 2005 and $139 million in 2004) was $410 million for the quarter, an improvement of $244 million from the second quarter last year.
 
"We are pleased with the improvement in our operational and financial performance. We've continued to meet our commitments with solid improvement in operating margin, earnings and cash flow," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS/Page 3
 
and chief executive officer. "We are committed to improve our business processes and product quality, continue to execute upon our long-term business strategies, and leverage the value inherent within our business portfolio."
 
Six-Month Results
 
For the first six months of 2005, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 8 percent to $5.0 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 3 percentage points year-to-date. Domestic sales totaled $2.2 billion, an increase of 4 percent over the same period last year, while international sales increased 12 percent (including a 6 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), to $2.8 billion.
 
Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $548 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in the first six months of the year, including the charge and restructuring benefit recorded in the second quarter. Excluding these items, the company reported year-to-date income from continuing operations of $533 million, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.85.
 
Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $779 million for the first six months of the year, compared to $252 million in the same period in 2004. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $163 million in 2005 and $229 million in 2004) was $616 million for the first half of 2005, an improvement of $593 million from the same period last year.
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS/Page 4
 
Third Quarter and Full-Year 2005 Outlook
 
For the third quarter of 2005, the company expects organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.45 to $0.47.
 
For full-year 2005, Baxter expects organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.86 to $1.90. Baxter also expects cash flow from continuing operations to exceed $1.6 billion, and to generate free cash flow of at least $1.0 billion in 2005 (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures).
 
The company's guidance above excludes the $0.02 per diluted share net benefit from the second-quarter charge and restructuring adjustment, future pre-tax charges expected to total $40 to $50 million related to the rationalization of its hemodialysis instrument manufacturing capacity, and the cost to repatriate foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Including the $0.02 per diluted share net benefit of the second-quarter items, Baxter's full-year earnings guidance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is expected to be $1.88 to $1.92 per diluted share.

This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results for the third quarter and full year, as well as developments with respect to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: timely realization of the benefits of the company's restructuring initiatives; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration and foreign counterparts that could delay, limit or suspend product sales and distribution, including with respect to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays or declining sales; product development risks; interest rates; demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; foreign currency exchange rates; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; global regulatory, trade and tax policies; regulatory, legal or other developments relating to the company's A, AF and AX series dialyzers; the ability to enforce patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; results of product testing; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's web site.

The non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures contained in this press release (including the presentation above of earnings and per-share earnings, excluding certain items) adjust for factors that are unusual or nonrecurring. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance period over period.

As further discussed in the company's SEC filings, during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company executed offsetting or mirror swaps. These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At June 30, 2005, approximately 55% of the net swaps liability has been fixed by the mirror swaps.
Note:
 
During the first half of 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $308 million. In accordance with GAAP, $363 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $55 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On October 20, 2005, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding certain items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER COMPANY DELIVERS SOLID OPERATING RESULTS AND CONTINUED CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENT DEERFIELD, Ill., Oct. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2005. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges described below, earnings from continuing operations totaled $296 million, and earnings per diluted share of $0.47 increased 12 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. Including these previously announced charges of $0.29 per diluted share in the quarter, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations on a GAAP basis totaled $116 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The previously announced charges recorded in the third quarter include a charge of $163 million (or $0.26 per diluted share) for the estimated tax expense related to the company's planned repatriation of approximately $2.0 billion in foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, and an after-tax charge of $20 million (or $0.03 per diluted share) for costs associated with Baxter's decision to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing. Worldwide sales totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year (including a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). Domestic sales declined 2 percent to $1.1 billion, while international sales grew 9 percent (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.3 billion. Contributing to sales growth was the continued strength of the BioScience business, with sales of $950 million, representing an increase of 12 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. Sales growth in this business was driven by a 15 percent increase in the recombinant business, including $162 million of sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A. Offsetting the strong sales in the BioScience business were lower sales of the company's COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump, which was on hold during the third quarter. COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump sales totaled approximately $65 million in the third quarter of 2004. Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $536 million for the quarter, compared to $277 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $116 million in 2005 and $134 million in 2004) was $420 million for the quarter, an improvement of $277 million from the third quarter last year. "We continue to focus on driving improved operating results and cash flow, which has enhanced our overall financial flexibility," said John Greisch, chief financial officer. "We have again achieved our financial commitments through improved operational execution across all of our businesses."
New Product Launches and Partnerships "In addition to our strong operating results in the third quarter, we made further progress on achieving R&D milestones and finalizing new partnerships," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, "We remain committed to providing value to our shareholders through predictable and sustainable growth over the long term, improving cash flow generation and capital allocation, and accelerating internal R&D and business development initiatives." During the third quarter, Baxter launched several new products and announced new collaborations, including research agreements with Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen Technologies. These collaborations focus on further advancing ADVATE, with the objective of reducing the frequency of infusions and enhancing quality of life for hemophilia patients. In addition to these agreements, the company launched GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution in the United States for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, and recently received FDA approval of FLEXBUMIN, the first preparation of human albumin to be packaged in a flexible container. Nine-Month Results For the first nine months of 2005, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 7 percent to $7.4 billion, up from $6.9 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 3 percentage points year-to-date. Domestic sales totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of 2 percent over the same period last year, while international sales increased 11 percent (including a 5 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), to $4.1 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding charges, the company reported year-to-date earnings from continuing operations of $829 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last year. Including the charges and restructuring benefits recorded in the second and third quarters, Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $664 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the first nine months of the year. Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the first nine months of the year, compared to $529 million in the same period in 2004. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $279 million in 2005 and $363 million in 2004) was $1.0 billion for the first nine months of 2005, an improvement of $870 million from the same period last year. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2005 Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2005, the company expects organic sales to decline in low single digits, and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to total $0.56 to $0.58. Accordingly, for full-year 2005, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.88 to $1.90. Baxter also now expects cash flow from continuing operations for full-year 2005 to be approximately $1.7 billion, and to generate free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion in 2005 (after approximately $500 million of anticipated capital expenditures). The company's guidance excludes the $0.26 per diluted share from the second and third quarter charges and restructuring adjustments, and also excludes further special charges in the balance of the year, including additional tax effects of the company's planned repatriation of approximately $2 billion under the American Jobs Creation Act, future costs associated with the company's decision to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing, any additional COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump-related charges, and costs associated with early debt retirement.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures contained in this press release (including the presentation above of earnings and per-share earnings, excluding certain items) adjust for factors that are unusual or nonrecurring. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance period over period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC.

These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At September 30, 2005, approximately 52% of the net swaps liability has been fixed by the mirror swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $379 million. In accordance with GAAP, $432 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $53 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. (2) The increase in short-term debt from December 31, 2004 to September 30, 2005 principally related to the reclassification of approximately $800 million of notes due in 2006 from long-term to short-term.

     SECTION 5. Covenants Of The Company. If and to the extent the Remarketed Senior Notes are required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for either the Remarketing Agent or the Company) to be registered under the Securities Act as in effect at the time of the Remarketing, the Company covenants and agrees as follows:
 
     (a) The Company shall prepare the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, in a form approved by the Remarketing Agent, shall file any such Prospectus pursuant to the Securities Act within the period required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date.
     (b) The Company shall file promptly with the Commission any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any supplement to the Prospectus that may, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or the Remarketing Agent, be required by the Securities Act or requested by the Commission.
     (c) The Company shall advise the Remarketing Agent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed and to furnish the Remarketing Agent with copies thereof.
     (d) The Company shall file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a Prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Remarketed Senior Notes.
     (e) The Company shall advise the Remarketing Agent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus, of the suspension of the qualification of any of the Remarketed Senior Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information, and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal.
     (f) The Company shall furnish promptly to the Remarketing Agent such copies of the following documents as the Remarketing Agent shall reasonably request: (A) conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed with the Commission and each amendment thereto (in each case excluding exhibits); (B) the Preliminary Prospectus and any amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus, (C) the Prospectus and any amended or supplemented Prospectus; and (D) any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (excluding exhibits thereto); and, if at any time when delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the Remarketing, any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to notify the
 
Remarketing Agent and, upon its request, to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to the Remarketing Agent and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Remarketing Agent may from time to time reasonably request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance.
     (g) Prior to filing with the Commission (A) any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (B) any Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, the Company shall furnish a copy thereof to the Remarketing Agent and counsel to the Remarketing Agent; and shall not file any such amendment or supplement that shall be reasonably disapproved by the Remarketing Agent promptly after reasonable notice;
     (h) As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months, after the effective date of the Registration Statement, the Company shall make "generally available to its security holders" an "earnings statement" of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Securities Act). The terms "generally available to its security holders" and "earnings statement" shall have the meanings set forth in Rule 158 under the Securities Act; and
     (i) The Company shall take such action as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request in order to qualify the Remarketed Senior Notes for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request; provided that in no event shall the Company be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.
     (j) The Company shall furnish the Remarketing Agent with such information and documents as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to make reasonably available to the Remarketing Agent and any accountant, attorney or other advisor retained by the Remarketing Agent such information that parties would customarily require in connection with a due diligence investigation conducted in accordance with applicable securities laws and to cause the Company's officers, directors, employees and accountants to participate in all such discussions and to supply all such information reasonably requested by any such Person in connection with such investigation.

     (c) The Prospectus, if any, shall have been timely filed with the Commission; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, if any, or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and any request of the Commission for inclusion of additional information in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or otherwise shall have been complied with.

     (f) The General Counsel for the Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent its opinion, addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated the Remarketing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent addressing such matters as are set forth in such counsel's opinion furnished pursuant to Section 5(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, adapted as necessary to relate to the securities being remarketed hereunder and to the Remarketing Materials, if any, or to any changed circumstances or events occurring subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such adaptations being reasonably acceptable to counsel to the Remarketing Agent.

     (i) The Senior Notes shall not have been called for redemption following the occurrence of a Special Event.
If any condition specified in this Section 7 is not satisfied when and as required to be satisfied, this Agreement may be terminated by the Remarketing Agent by notice to the Company at any time on or prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, which termination shall be without liability on the part of any party to any other party, except that Section 6, Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.
     SECTION 8. Indemnification.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, its officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any information deemed to be a part thereof under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
 
therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) in whole or in part upon any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein; or (iv) in whole or in part upon any failure of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or under law; or (v) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Remarketing Agent in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Remarketed Senior Notes or the Remarketing contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon any matter covered by clause (i) or (ii) above, and to reimburse the Remarketing Agent and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Remarketing Agent) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided, further, that with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of the Remarketing Agent if the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Remarketed Senior Notes, or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent, if copies of the Prospectus were timely delivered to the Remarketing Agent and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Remarketed Senior Notes to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) The Remarketing Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Remarketing Agent), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Remarketing Agent has furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is the information set forth in a certificate to be provided by the Remarketing Agent on or prior to the Remarketing Date. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party (the Remarketing Agent in the case of Section 8(b)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the
 
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
     (d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     SECTION 9. Contribution.
     If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agent, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Remarketing Price of the Remarketed Senior Notes as set forth on such cover. The
 
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
     The provisions set forth in Section 8(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification.
     The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of the Remarketing Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Remarketing Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
     SECTION 10. Resignation And Removal Of The Remarketing Agent.
     Banc of America, CSFB or UBS (the "Remarketing Agent Candidates") may resign and be discharged from their duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any of the Remarketing Agent Candidates, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent Candidate and the Depositary; provided, however, that if only one Remarketing Agent Candidate remains:
     (a) such Remarketing Agent Candidate may not resign without reasonable cause; and
 
     (b) no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent Candidate pursuant to this Agreement.
     SECTION 11. Dealing In Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "Securities"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
     SECTION 12. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty Of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
     SECTION 13. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 10 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date and (y) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for
 
all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Section 8, Section 9 and Section 12 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent.

If any condition specified in this is not satisfied when and as required to be satisfied, this Supplemental Agreement may be terminated by the Remarketing Agents by notice in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing to the Company at any time on or prior to the Remarketing Closing Date, which termination shall be without liability on the part of any party to any other party, except that and of this Supplemental Agreement and of the Remarketing Agreement shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.

(a) The Senior Notes will bear interest initially at the rate of 3.6% per year (the "Coupon Rate") from the original date of issuance through and including the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the day immediately preceding any Reset Effective Date. In the event of a Successful Remarketing of the Senior Notes, the Coupon Rate will be reset by the Remarketing Agent at the appropriate Reset Rate with effect from the related Reset Effective Date, as set forth under Section 8.03.

     (b) Interest on the Senior Notes shall be payable quarterly in arrears on February 16, May 16, August 16 and November 16 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing February 16, 2003, to the Person in whose name such Senior Note, or any predecessor Senior Note, is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date. Interest on the Senior Notes shall accrue from December 17, 2002.
     (c) The amount of interest payable for any full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for any period less than a month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any scheduled Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next calendar year, then such payment will be made on the preceding Business Day.
     Section 2.06. No Defeasance. The provisions of Section 402 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Senior Notes.

     Section 3.01. Special Event Redemption. If a Special Event shall occur and be continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, on any Interest Payment Date prior to the earlier of the date of a Successful Remarketing or the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Senior Note equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "Special Event Redemption Date") to the Holders of the Senior Notes registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date. If the Company so elects to redeem the Senior Notes, the Company shall appoint the Quotation Agent to assist the Company in determining the Treasury
 
Portfolio Purchase Price. Notice of any Special Event Redemption will be mailed by the Company (with a copy to the Trustee) at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Special Event Redemption Date to each registered Holder of the Senior Notes at its registered address. In addition, the Company shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that a Special Event has occurred and that the Company intends to redeem the Senior Notes on the Special Event Redemption Date. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Special Event Redemption Date, (a) interest shall cease to accrue on the Senior Notes, (b) the Senior Notes shall become due and payable at the Redemption Price, and (c) the Senior Notes shall be void and all rights of the Holders in respect of the Senior Notes shall terminate and lapse (other than the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Senior Notes but without interest on such Redemption Price). Following the notice of a Special Event Redemption, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required to register the transfer of or exchange the Senior Notes to be redeemed.
     Section 3.02. Redemption Procedures. On or prior to the Special Event Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Special Event Redemption Date, the aggregate Redemption Price for all outstanding Senior Notes. In exchange for any Senior Notes surrendered for redemption on or after the Special Event Redemption Date, the Trustee shall pay an amount equal to the Redemption Price (a) to the Collateral Agent, in the case of Senior Notes that are included in Corporate Units, which amount shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and (b) to the holders of the Separate Senior Notes, in the case of Separate Senior Notes.
     Section 4.01. Form Of Senior Note. The Senior Notes and the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication to be endorsed thereon are to be substantially in the forms attached as Exhibit A hereto, with such changes therein as the officers of the Company executing the Senior Notes (by manual or facsimile signature) may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by their execution thereof.
     Section 5.01. Original Issue Of Senior Notes. Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,100,000,000 (or up to $1,250,000,000 to the
 
extent that the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised) may from time to time, upon execution of this Supplemental Indenture, be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Senior Notes to or upon the written order of the Company pursuant to Section 303 of the Base Indenture without any further action by the Company (other than as required by the Base Indenture).
     Section 6.01. Original Issue Discount. The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Senior Notes that are Outstanding as of the end of the year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
     Section 7.01. Ratification Of Indenture. The Indenture, as supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Supplemental Indenture shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.

     Section 7.04. Separability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplemental Indenture or in the Senior Notes shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then, to the
 
extent permitted by law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Senior Notes, but this Supplemental Indenture and the Senior Notes shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein.
     Section 7.05. Counterparts. This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

(a) Unless a Special Event Redemption or a Successful Remarketing has occurred prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for the Remarketing of the Senior Notes. The Company will request, not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Senior Notes, Corporate Units and Treasury Units of the procedures to be followed in the applicable Remarketing.
     (b) Each Holder of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have Separate Senior Notes held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Senior Notes to the Custodial Agent prior to 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date (but no earlier than the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date). Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn prior to 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Pledge Agreement. Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to such Remarketing. Pursuant to Section 5.07(c) of the Pledge Agreement, promptly after 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the principal amount of Separate Senior Notes to be tendered for remarketing and shall cause such Separate Senior Notes to be
 
presented to the Remarketing Agent. Under Section 5.02 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Senior Notes that are components of Corporate Units will be deemed tendered for Remarketing and will be remarketed in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement.
     (c) The right of each Holder of Senior Notes that are included in Corporate Units to have such Senior Notes, and each Holder of Separate Senior Notes to have any Separate Senior Notes (together, the "Remarketed Senior Notes"), remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) a Special Event Redemption has not occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent as and when required.
     (d) Neither the Trustee, the Company nor the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Senior Notes for remarketing.
     Section 8.02. Remarketing. (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, on the Initial Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at a price (the "Remarketing Price") equal to approximately 100.25% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Senior Note Purchase Price.
     (b) In the case of a Failed Initial Remarketing and unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, on the Final Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at a price (the "Final Remarketing Price") equal to approximately 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. It is understood and agreed that Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful and no further attempts will be made if the resulting proceeds are at least 100.25% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Senior Note Purchase Price, in the case of the Initial Remarketing, or 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes in the case of the Final Remarketing.
     Section 8.03. Reset Rate. (a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) that the Remarketed Senior Notes
 
should bear in order to have an aggregate market value equal to the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, and that in the sole discretion of the Remarketing Agent will enable it to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, in such Remarketing.
     (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and the Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Senior Notes and they shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the Initial Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate.
     (c) In the event of a Failed Remarketing or if no Senior Notes are included in Corporate Units and none of the holders of the Separate Senior Notes elect to have their Senior Notes remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Senior Notes will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate.
     (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset at the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement.
     Section 8.04. Failed Remarketing. (a) If, by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Remarketing Agent shall so advise, by telephone the Depositary, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. Promptly following any Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return Separate Senior Notes submitted for remarketing, if any, to the Custodial Agent for distribution to the appropriate Holders.
     (b) The Company shall cause a notice of such Failed Remarketing to be published in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in the City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal.
     Section 8.05. Put Right. (a) If there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes and Holders of Senior Notes that are a component of Corporate
 
Units will, subject to this Section 8.05, have the right (the "Put Right") to require the Company to purchase their Senior Notes, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Senior Note equal to $50.00 plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "Put Price").
     (b) The Put Right of Holders of Senior Notes that are part of Corporate Units will be automatically exercised unless such Holders (1) prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to settle the related Purchase Contract with separate cash, and (2) on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, deliver to the Collateral Agent $50 in cash per Purchase Contract, in each case pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Unless a Corporate Unit holder has settled the related Purchase Contract with separate cash on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, shall cause the Put Price to be deposited in the Collateral Account and the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to remit the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right to the Company in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contract. Any remaining amount of the Put Price following satisfaction of the related Purchase Contract will be paid to such Corporate Unit holder. If the Company shall fail to pay the Put Price on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall be deemed to have netted its obligation to pay the Put Price against the obligation of a Holder of a Senior Note that is a component of a Corporate Unit to pay the Purchase Price under the related Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
     (c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Senior Note shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice to the Trustee by such Holder on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. On or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the aggregate Put Price of all Separate Senior Notes with respect to which a Holder has exercised a Put Right. In exchange for any Separate Senior Notes surrendered pursuant to the Put Right, the Trustee shall then distribute such amount to the Holders of such Separate Senior Notes.
     Section 8.06. Additional Event of Default. In addition to the events listed as Events of Default in Section 501 of the Base Indenture, it shall be an additional Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes, if the Company shall not have satisfied its obligation to pay the Put Price when due in accordance with
 
Section 8.05 (either by payment of the Put Price to the Trustee when due, by deposit of the Put Price in the Collateral Account when due or by netting the Put Price against a Holder's obligation under the related Purchase Contract if a Senior Note is a component of a Corporate Unit).
     Section 9.01. Tax Treatment. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a Corporate Unit, each holder of a Corporate Unit will be deemed to have agreed (1) for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to treat the acquisition of a Corporate Unit as the acquisition of the Senior Note and the Purchase Contract constituting the Corporate Unit and (2) to treat the Senior Note as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. A Holder of Senior Notes may obtain the comparable yield and projected payment schedule for the Senior Notes, determined by the Company pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1275-4, by submitting a written request for such information to the Company at the following address: Baxter International Inc., One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015, Attention: Treasurer.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Senior Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Senior Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Senior Note.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On January 26, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted gross profit and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding certain items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Each of these items is identified in the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that accompany the press release. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. In addition, the tax rate may vary substantially by the type of unusual or recurring item so disclosing income before and after tax impact (as bridged by the tax) may provide users with additional insight into the impact of these items. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99 BAXTER REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2005 Baxter's Adjusted Earnings and Cash Flow Exceed Company's Previously Issued Guidance Company Provides 2006 Financial Outlook DEERFIELD, Ill., Jan. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005, and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2006. Summary of Fourth Quarter Results On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges described below, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations totaled $379 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.60 increased 5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Including after-tax special charges of $85 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the quarter, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations on a GAAP basis totaled $294 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $0.17 per diluted share in 2004. The previously announced after-tax special charges recorded in the fourth quarter totaled $85 million ($0.14 per diluted share) and included costs associated with the withdrawal of its 6060 ambulatory infusion pump, additional costs associated with Baxter's decision in July 2005 to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing, costs associated with the early retirement of debt during the quarter, and the tax expense related to the company's completed repatriation of approximately $2.1 billion in foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Details of these charges are included in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Worldwide sales totaled $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a decline of 4 percent compared to the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 3 percent. Domestic sales declined 11 percent to $1.1 billion, while international sales grew 2 percent to $1.4 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international sales increased 4 percent. As the company expected, sales were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to the hold on shipments of the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump, the effect of exiting several lower-margin businesses, and the impact of generic competition for propofol, an anesthetic agent. Offsetting these items was solid sales growth in Baxter's BioScience business, with sales totaling $1.0 billion, an increase of 6 percent (or 8 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales growth in the BioScience business was driven by increased sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, which totaled $174 million for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. In addition, Bioscience sales were driven by strong growth in sales of Antibody Therapy products, which included recently-launched GAMMAGARD LIQUID(TM) [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies.
Summary of Full-Year 2005 Results For full-year 2005, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 4 percent to $9.8 billion, up from $9.5 billion reported last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 2 percentage points during the year. Domestic sales totaled $4.4 billion, a decline of 2 percent from last year, while international sales increased 8 percent (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), to $5.5 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding net special charges, the company reported 2005 earnings from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, an increase of 14 percent over last year. Baxter's adjusted earnings exceeded the company's financial guidance for 2005 of $1.88 to $1.90, excluding net charges. Including net charges recorded during the year of $250 million ($0.40 per diluted share), Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $958 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared to $0.62 per diluted share in 2004. Details of net charges recorded in 2004 and 2005 are included in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Excluding the previously announced $400 million contribution in the fourth quarter to domestic pension plans, cash flow from operations totaled $2.0 billion, or $1.6 billion after the pension contribution. Baxter's full-year cash flow performance exceeded the company's financial guidance for 2005, which had projected cash flow from operations of approximately $1.7 billion, excluding the fourth quarter pension plan contribution. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $444 million in 2005) totaled $1.1 billion, or $1.5 billion excluding the fourth quarter pension plan contribution. During the year, Baxter achieved significant reductions in a number of its financial obligations. Debt was reduced by approximately $1.0 billion, and the company made contributions of approximately $570 million to its pension plans. Baxter also reduced its net investment hedge liabilities by $527 million during the year. "We have made considerable progress during 2005, meeting or exceeding virtually all of our key financial objectives, despite the challenges with the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "During 2005, we also increased our spending on R&D and accelerated the pace of business development initiatives, which reflects our commitment to reinvigorating innovation within our company." First Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Outlook For the first time, Baxter is providing its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2006. Due to the continued hold on shipments of the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump and the uncertainty of the timing of resuming COLLEAGUE sales, the company's guidance for full-year 2006 does not reflect any pump sales or earnings contributions from this product. Baxter's guidance also excludes the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2003), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123-R), relating to stock option expense. The company estimates stock option expense of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share for full year 2006. For full-year 2006, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 4 to 5 percent and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.08 to $2.16, before any special items. Baxter expects cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to total approximately $1.9 billion, with free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the first quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales to grow 2 to 3 percent, and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to total $0.41 to $0.43, before any special items. The first quarter guidance excludes the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123-R, which the company estimates to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share.
"The significant progress we've made in improving our balance sheet, earnings and cash flow in 2005 provides us with considerable financial flexibility," said John J. Greisch, corporate vice president and chief financial officer. "Our 2006 guidance includes increased investments in sales and marketing, and accelerated spending in research and development and business development activities."

This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: timely realization of the benefits of the company's restructuring initiatives; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration and foreign counterparts that could delay, limit or suspend product sales or result in seizures, injunctions and monetary sanctions, including with respect to the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; interest rates; demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; foreign currency exchange rates; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; global regulatory, trade and tax policies; the ability to enforce patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; results of product testing; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's web site.

Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance period over period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in evaluating management performance.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. Cash Flows from Operations and Changes in Net Debt (unaudited) ($ in millions) Cash Flows from Operations - --------------------------
Changes in Net Debt - ------------------- (A) The 2004 net-debt-to-capital ratio was calculated in accordance with the company's primary credit agreements, which gave 70% equity credit to the company's December 2002 $1.25 billion issuance of equity units. As originally scheduled, in November 2005, the $1.25 billion senior notes included in the equity units were remarketed, and the company repurchased $1 billion of the remarketed notes. In February 2006, the purchase contracts included in the equity units will mature, and the company will receive $1.25 billion in cash and issue between 35.0 to 43.4 million common shares, based on a specified exchange ratio (if the average price of the company's stock over the 20-day trading period ending on February 13th exceeds $35.69, then 35 million shares will be issued). Management plans to use a portion of the cash proceeds to pay down maturing debt. As a result of these cash proceeds, the company's net-debt-to-capital ratio will decrease significantly during the first quarter of 2006. Holding all other variables constant, the February 2006 $1.25 billion cash proceeds would reduce the net-debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2005 by 18.4 percentage points, from 36.7% to 18.3%.

These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At December 31, 2005, approximately 52% of the net swaps liability has been fixed by the mirror swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $379 million. In accordance with GAAP, $432 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $53 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. (2) The increase in short-term debt from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 principally related to the reclassification of approximately $800 million of notes due in 2006 from long-term to short-term.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     DEERFIELD, Ill., February 15, 2006  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the company's common stock.
     The company can repurchase approximately $250 million in common stock under its previous share repurchase program, which was authorized by the Board in 2002. The new share repurchase program authorized by the Board provides the company greater flexibility to repurchase shares in the future. Shares will be repurchased at times and amounts determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market.
     "Our strong cash position and balance sheet now provide us significant flexibility to both invest in our future growth, including acquisitions and other business development activities, and provide greater value to our shareholders through periodic share repurchases. We plan to do both in a balanced and disciplined manner," said John J. Greisch, corporate vice president and chief financial officer.
 
     Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, assists healthcare professionals and their patients with the treatment of complex medical conditions, including cancer, hemophilia, immune disorders, kidney disease and trauma. The company applies its expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.
This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: timely realization of the benefits of the company's restructuring initiatives; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration and foreign counterparts that could delay, limit or suspend product sales or result in seizures, injunctions and monetary sanctions, including with respect to the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; interest rates; demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; foreign currency exchange rates; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; global regulatory, trade and tax policies; the ability to enforce patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; results of product testing; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's web site.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On April 20, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The press release uses the non-GAAP financial measure earnings per diluted share, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R is excluded to provide a comparison to prior periods that have not been restated to include such expenses. Management believes that this non-GAAP earnings measure facilitates a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses this non-GAAP measure internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

One Baxter Parkway Deerfield, IL 60015 [LOGO OF BAXTER] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- MEDIA CONTACTS: Deborah Spak, (847) 948-2349 Tom Kline, (847) 948-2251 INVESTOR CONTACTS: Mary Kay Ladone, (847) 948-3371 Clare Sullivan, (847) 948-3085 BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE OF $0.43, AN INCREASE OF 19 PERCENT COMPANY NARROWS FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE RANGE DEERFIELD, Ill., April 20, 2006 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported stronger than expected growth in earnings and organic sales for the first quarter. First quarter net income of $282 million increased 26 percent compared to $224 million in the first quarter of 2005. Earnings per diluted share of $0.43 increased 19 percent over last year. Contributing to the growth in earnings were improved margins, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. Excluding the impact of stock-option expense of $0.02 per diluted share under SFAS No. 123-R, earnings per diluted share totaled $0.45, which compares favorably with the guidance that Baxter previously provided for the quarter of $0.41 to $0.43 (which also excluded the impact of stock-option expense). -more-
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/PAGE 2 - ------------------------------------------- Baxter's sales totaled $2.4 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 4 percent on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales growth exceeded Baxter's guidance of 2 to 3 percent due to strong growth in the company's BioScience business. Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, reported sales grew 1 percent in the quarter. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 1 percent over the same period last year, and sales outside of the United States also grew 1 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.3 billion in the quarter. Strong sales in the company's BioScience business, which totaled $1.0 billion and grew 11 percent, offset the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the COLLEAGUE(R) Infusion Pump hold, generic competition and the exit of lower-margin businesses. "We are extremely pleased with our first quarter financial results," said John J. Greisch, Baxter's chief financial officer. "Our strong financial performance reflects the value of our diversified portfolio and our ability to meet or exceed our commitments while improving the financial profile of the company." Baxter's cash flow also improved in the quarter. The company generated $305 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter compared to $272 million in the same period last year. "We've made great progress over the last several quarters improving our financial position and operational execution, expanding our global market positions, and focusing our efforts on enhancing product innovation and R&D productivity," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.

BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/PAGE 4 - ------------------------------------------- SECOND QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK Given the strong financial performance of the company in the first quarter, Baxter is narrowing its earnings guidance range for the full-year 2006. The company now expects to achieve organic sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $2.10 to $2.16, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense of $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share. This compares favorably to the company's original guidance of $2.08 to $2.16, which also excluded special items and stock-option expense. Baxter continues to expect cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to total approximately $1.9 billion, with free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the second quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to grow 2 to 3 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $0.54 to $0.56, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense of approximately $0.03 per diluted share. A webcast of Baxter's first quarter conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link on the company's website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CDT on April 20, 2006.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND 2005 (unaudited) (in millions, except per share and percentage data) Note: Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123-R using the modified prospective method. After-tax stock-option expense for the first quarter of 2006 was $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. In accordance with the modified prospective adoption method, the company did not adjust its historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of stock-option expense. Based on the pro forma application of SFAS No. 123 for the calculation of stock-option expense prior to January 1, 2006 (as previously disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements), pro forma after-tax stock-option expense in the first quarter of 2005 was $12 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

In February 2006, the purchase contracts included in the company's equity units matured, and the company issued approximately 35 million common shares in exchange for $1.25 billion. Management used a portion of the cash proceeds to pay down maturing debt. The net-debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, 2005 was calculated in accordance with the company's primary credit agreements, which gave 70% equity credit to the company's $1.25 billion equity units debt outstanding on that date (the majority of which was repurchased and retired in the fourth quarter of 2005). Refer to the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 for additional information regarding the equity units.

Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
     The terms of the Corporation's Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock are incorporated from the Certificate of Designation pursuant to which it was created into the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as follows:
     RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of this Corporation by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the designations, powers, preferences and relative and other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as follows:
     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.
     The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 3,500,000.
 
     SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
     (A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of January, April, July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $5.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all noncash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $1 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after November 17, 1998 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior to and superior to the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, a dividend of $5.00 per share on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
     (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating
 
Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payments thereof.
     SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS.
     The holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
     (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holder of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote collectively as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
     (C) If at any time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors a default in preference dividends on the Preferred Stock shall exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Preferred Stock of all series shall have the right at such meeting, voting together as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships. Such right shall continue until there are no dividends in arrears upon the Preferred Stock. Each director elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (herein called a "Preferred Director"), shall continue to serve as such director for the full term for which he shall have been elected, notwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default in preference dividends shall cease to exist. Any Preferred Director may be removed by, and shall not be removed except by, the vote of holders of record of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at a meeting of the stockholders, or of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, called for the purpose. So long as a default in any preference dividends on the Preferred Stock shall exist (A) any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director may be filled (except as provided in the following clause (B)) by an instrument in writing signed by the remaining Preferred Director and filed with the Corporation and (B) in the case of the removal of any Preferred Director, the vacancy may be filled by the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at the same meeting at which such removal shall be voted. Each director appointed as aforesaid by the remaining Preferred Director shall be deemed, for all purposes hereof, to be a Preferred Director. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Directors shall end and a default in preference dividends shall no longer exist, the number of directors, constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be reduced by two. For the purposes hereof, a "default in preference dividends" on the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of accrued dividends upon any series of the Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six full quarter yearly dividends or more, and, having so occurred, such default shall be deemed to exist thereafter until, but only until, all accrued dividends on all shares of Preferred Stock of each and every series then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the end of the last preceding quarterly dividend period.
 
     (D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
     SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
     (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or distributions payable on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
     (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
     SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES.
     Any shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition
 
thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
     SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.
     (A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series B Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series B Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
     (B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.
     (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.
     In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into
 
which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION.
     The shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
     SECTION 9. RANKING.
     The Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets whether or not upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
     SECTION 10. AMENDMENT.
     The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
     SECTION 11. FRACTIONAL SHARES.
     Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
     The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be the number from time to time fixed by the Board of Directors but in no event shall be less than nine or more than seventeen. A decrease in the number of directors shall not affect the term of office of any director then in office.

Exhibit 10.1
 
     On October 12, 2005, plaintiff, the United States of America, by and through its attorneys, filed a verified complaint for forfeiture against certain articles that were in the possession of Baxter Healthcare Corporation ("Baxter"), located in Buffalo Grove, Illinois and Cardinal Health Inc. ("Cardinal"), located in Waukegan, Illinois. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the above-captioned articles (the "Seized Articles") are adulterated and misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "Act"), 21 U.S.C.  351(c), 351(h), and 352(t)(2). On October 26, 2005, plaintiff filed an amended complaint with substantially similar allegations. Pursuant to each Warrant of Seizure and Monition issued by this court, the United States Marshal for this district seized the articles of device at Cardinal's and Baxter's facilities on October 12, 2005, and at Baxter's facility on October 27, 2005. Baxter filed a statement of interest for the Seized
in rem
 
Articles on November 7, 2005, and its Answer on January 11, 2006, denying the allegations in the amended complaint and asserting affirmative defenses.
     The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that certain of the Seized Articles are: (1) adulterated within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  351(c), in that their quality falls below that which they purport and are represented to possess; (2) adulterated within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  351(h), in that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, and installation are not in conformity with current good manufacturing practice ("CGMP") and the Quality System regulation ("QS Regulation") as promulgated under 21 C.F.R. Part 820; and (3) misbranded within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), in that the firm failed or refused to furnish information required by the Act, 21 U.S.C.  360(i).
     Defendants, Baxter, Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. (who assumed his position as Baxter's Chief Executive Officer on April 26, 2004), and Peter J. Arduini (who assumed his position as Corporate Vice President and President of Baxter's Medication Delivery Services on April 18, 2005) (collectively, the "Defendants"), without admitting the allegations in the complaint and amended complaint, and disclaiming any liability in connection therewith, having appeared, waived the filing and service of a second amended complaint seeking injunctive relief, and, without contest and before any testimony having been taken, agreed to the entry of this decree.
     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:
     1. This court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction over all parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1345 and 21 U.S.C.  332 and 334. Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C.  1391(b)-(c) and 1395.
 
     2. The complaint and amended complaint state a claim for relief against the Seized Articles under the Act, 21 U.S.C.  301-397.
     3. Defendant Baxter affirms that it is the sole owner of the Seized Articles, and that no other person has an interest in the Seized Articles. Defendant Baxter further affirms that it shall indemnify and hold the United States harmless should any other party or parties hereafter file or seek to file a statement of interest or right to intervene in this action, or seek to defend or obtain any part of the Seized Articles.
     4. The Seized Articles are hereby condemned pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  334(a) and forfeited to the United States.
     5. The United States shall recover from Defendant Baxter all court costs, fees, and storage and other proper expenses, and such further costs for which Defendant Baxter is liable pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  334(e) with respect to the Seized Articles. Defendant Baxter shall pay these costs within ten (10) calendar days of receiving written notice from FDA of such costs.
     6. A. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  334(d)(1), within twenty (20) calendar days of the entry of this decree, Defendant Baxter shall execute and file with the clerk of this court a good and sufficient penal bond in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the "Penal Bond") in the amount of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000). The Penal Bond shall be obtained from a trust company or commercial institution in good standing, payable to the United States, valid for at least one year from the date said Penal Bond is approved by this court. The Penal Bond shall be in a form acceptable to the clerk of this court and conditioned on Defendants abiding by and performing all
 
of the terms and conditions of this decree and of such further orders and decrees as may be entered in this proceeding, and may be drawn upon by the presentation of a sight draft.
          B. If Defendant Baxter has not completed the process of destroying or attempting to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the law, as set forth in paragraph 7, prior to the expiration of the original Penal Bond, or any subsequent Penal Bond, it shall be the responsibility of Defendant Baxter to file with the clerk of this court a new Penal Bond, valid for at least an additional one year, no later than sixty (60) calendar days before the expiration of the previous Penal Bond, and to provide written notice of the posting of such new Penal Bond and a copy thereof to both FDA and the United States Attorney assigned to this case. If, sixty (60) calendar days before the expiration of the original Penal Bond, Defendant Baxter has not completed the process of destroying or attempting to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the law and has not filed a new Penal Bond with the clerk of this court, the existing Penal Bond shall be immediately payable to the United States of America prior to expiration of such Penal Bond.
     7. A. Within forty (40) calendar days of the entry of this decree, and after filing the Penal Bond with this court as provided in paragraph 6 of this decree, Defendant Baxter shall give written notice to FDA that Defendant Baxter, at its own expense, is prepared to attempt to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the law under FDA's supervision. Defendant Baxter, also within forty (40) calendar days of entry of this decree and filing of the Bond, shall submit to FDA a detailed written plan describing its proposal to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the Act. The plan shall specifically identify which reconditioning measures apply to which Seized Articles. Defendants shall not attempt to bring the Seized Articles into compliance until they have submitted a written plan to FDA and FDA has provided them with written authorization to
 
commence attempting to bring the articles into compliance. FDA's decision regarding the adequacy of the reconditioning proposal shall be final.
          B. FDA shall notify Defendant Baxter in writing within forty-five (45) calendar days of FDA's receipt of Baxter's reconditioning plan whether the reconditioning plan is acceptable in whole or in part. If the reconditioning plan is acceptable with regard to some of the Seized Articles and not others, FDA shall specify those Seized Articles for which the reconditioning plan is acceptable. If FDA notifies Defendant Baxter in writing that some or all of the reconditioning plan is unacceptable, FDA shall state the basis for such determination. Defendant Baxter shall then submit, within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of FDA's letter, either a revised reconditioning plan for those articles for which the initial plan was unacceptable or a plan to destroy those articles as set forth below. FDA shall respond in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of Baxter's revised reconditioning plan to notify Defendants as to whether the revised plan is acceptable. If Defendant Baxter has not submitted a revised reconditioning plan within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of FDA's letter, or if FDA finds that the revised reconditioning plan is unacceptable, Defendant Baxter shall cause that portion of the Seized Articles for which no revised reconditioning plan was submitted or for which the revised reconditioning plan was deemed unacceptable, to be promptly destroyed at Defendant Baxter's expense and under the supervision of an FDA representative. Destruction pursuant to this paragraph may take the form of a salvaging operation that permits Defendant Baxter to dismantle specified Seized Articles for the purpose of salvaging and preserving specified parts and components of the Seized Articles, provided that Defendant Baxter first submits such salvaging plan to FDA in writing and receives FDA's written authorization to implement the salvaging plan. If FDA finds that Defendant Baxter's revised
 
reconditioning plan and/or salvaging plan is unacceptable, in whole or in part, Defendants may challenge that decision under the terms set forth in paragraph 26. Defendants may execute any portion of the initial or revised reconditioning or salvaging plan that was found acceptable by FDA in accordance with the applicable provisions in this decree.
          C. Defendants shall not dispose of the Seized Articles or any part of them in a manner contrary to the provisions of the Act, or any other federal law, or of the laws of any state or territory (as defined in the Act) in which they are disposed. All Seized Articles that are not successfully reconditioned as provided in this decree shall be destroyed at Defendant Baxter's expense under the supervision of an FDA representative, and Defendant Baxter shall pay to the United States all costs incurred in supervising the destruction of such articles, at rates specified in paragraph 20 of this decree. If requested by FDA, Defendants shall furnish duplicate copies of invoices of sale of any released devices, or other evidence of disposition as FDA may request.
          D. Following Defendants' receipt of written authorization to commence attempting to bring the products into compliance with the Act and following the payment of costs pursuant to paragraph 5 and the posting of the Penal Bond by Defendant Baxter as required by paragraph 6 of this decree, the United States Marshal for this district shall, upon receiving written notice from FDA, release those articles that are specified in FDA's notice to Defendants from his custody to the custody of Defendants for the sole purpose of attempting to bring the articles into compliance with the law, pursuant to the reconditioning proposal(s) approved by FDA as set forth in paragraph 7.
          E. Defendants shall at all times, until the Seized Articles have been brought into compliance with the law as determined by FDA or destroyed under FDA supervision, retain the
 
Seized Articles intact for examination or inspection by FDA in a place made known to and approved by FDA, and shall retain the records or other proof necessary to establish the identity of the Seized Articles.
          F. Within ninety (90) calendar days of receiving approval and/or rejection of the reconditioning plan and/or salvaging plan pursuant to paragraph 7, Defendants shall either destroy the Seized Articles at Defendant Baxter's sole expense under the supervision of the FDA representative or complete its attempt to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the law in the manner set forth in the reconditioning plan and/or salvaging plan found acceptable to FDA. Defendant Baxter shall reimburse the United States for the costs of supervising the reconditioning and/or destruction of the Seized Articles within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving an invoice for such costs at the rates listed in paragraph 20. Defendant Baxter shall also bear all costs of destruction and be responsible for ensuring that such destruction is carried out in a manner that complies with the provisions of the Act, other federal law, and the laws of any state or territory (as defined in the Act) in which they are disposed of. Within twenty-five (25) calendar days of receiving Defendants' written notice to FDA of its completion of its attempt to bring the Seized Articles into compliance with the Act and/or destruction of the articles, FDA shall provide Defendant Baxter with an invoice for the costs of supervising such attempt and/or destruction. Defendant Baxter shall pay those costs within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving FDA's invoice. Upon receipt of such payment from Defendant Baxter, FDA will notify the United States Attorney for this district that Defendants have brought the articles into compliance with the law and/or destroyed the articles, and that Defendant Baxter has paid the costs set forth in FDA's invoice.
 
          G. The United States Attorney for this district, upon being advised by FDA that the Seized Articles have been destroyed or brought into compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations, and that the foregoing conditions of this decree have been performed, shall transmit such information to the clerk of this court, whereupon the Penal Bond given in this proceeding by Defendant Baxter shall be canceled and discharged.
     8. If Defendants fail to abide by and perform all of the terms and conditions of this decree, or of the Penal Bond, or of such further order or decree as may be entered in this proceeding relating to the Seized Articles, then the Penal Bond posted as provided in paragraph 6 of this decree shall, on motion of the United States in this proceeding, be forfeited in its entirety and judgment entered in favor of plaintiff. In addition, if Defendants breach any term or condition of this decree or such further order or decree as may be entered in this proceeding, then Defendant Baxter shall, at its own expense, immediately return the Seized Articles to the United States Marshal for this district or otherwise dispose of them pursuant to an order of this court. Following return of the articles to the United States, the Marshal shall destroy the Seized Articles and make due return to this court. In the event that destruction of the Seized Articles by the Marshal becomes necessary pursuant to this paragraph, Defendant Baxter shall be responsible for all costs of storage and disposition that are incurred by the United States.
     9. Defendants shall at no time, and under no circumstances whatsoever, ship, sell, offer for sale, or otherwise dispose of the Seized Articles, or any part thereof, until: (a) FDA has had free access to the articles in order to take any samples or make any tests or examinations that FDA deems necessary; (b) FDA has notified Defendants in writing that any reconditioning to be conducted in accordance with the reconditioning proposal in paragraph 7 is complete and that the reconditioned
 
products comply with the Act, its implementing regulations, and this decree; and (c) that FDA has notified the United States Attorney for this district that Defendants have completed their attempt to bring the articles into compliance with the law in accordance with paragraph 7(F).
     10. Upon entry of this decree, Defendants, and each and all of Baxter's officers, directors, agents, representatives, employees, successors, assigns, attorneys, and any and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them (including franchisees, affiliates, and "doing business as" entities), who have received actual notice of the contents of this decree by personal service or otherwise, are permanently enjoined, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  332(a), subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 11, from manufacturing, processing, packing, repacking, labeling, distributing, or importing into the United States of America any model or components for its Colleague Volumetric Infusion Pumps (including, but not limited to, models 2M8151, 2M8151R, 2M8161, 2M8161R, 2M8153, 2M8153R, 2M8163, and 2M8163R) ("Colleague Infusion Pumps") and Syndeo Infusion Pumps (including model 2L3113) ("Syndeo Infusion Pumps") (collectively, the "Infusion Pumps"), unless and until:
          A. Defendants' methods, facilities, and controls used to manufacture, process, pack, repack, label, hold, and distribute the Infusion Pumps are established, operated, and administered in compliance with 21 U.S.C.  351(h) and 21 C.F.R. Part 820;
          B. Defendants select and retain, at Defendants' expense, an independent person or persons (the "Expert"), who is qualified by education, training, and experience to conduct inspections at Baxter's facilities that manufacture, process, pack, repack, label, hold, or distribute the Infusion Pumps, or any component thereof (hereafter, the "Infusion Pump Facilities"), and to
 
review procedures and methods for manufacturing, processing, packing, repacking, labeling, holding, and distributing the Infusion Pumps, to determine whether their methods, facilities, and controls are operated and administered in conformity with 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and this decree. The Expert shall be without personal or financial ties (other than a consulting agreement between the parties) to any officer or employee of Baxter or their immediate families. Defendants shall notify FDA in writing of the identity of the Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of retaining such Expert;
          C. The Expert shall perform a comprehensive inspection of Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities and their manner of operation and certify in writing to FDA: (1) that he or she has inspected Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities, processes, and controls; and (2) whether Defendants' operations are, in the Expert's opinion, in conformity with 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and this decree. The Expert's certification report shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

               ii. Steps taken by Defendants to identify the root causes, or if not precisely known, the most probable root causes, for the failures with the Infusion Pumps, and an evaluation whether Defendants have implemented appropriate steps to correct and prevent such failures;
               iii. Defendants' procedures for properly and timely reporting adverse events under 21 C.F.R. Part 803;
 
               iv. Steps taken by management with executive responsibility to ensure continuous implementation of an adequate and effective quality system, including specific written procedures governing management review and quality audits;
               v. A detailed evaluation of Baxter's current state of compliance with respect to the CGMP and QS Regulation deviations brought to Baxter's attention in writing by FDA and/or FDA investigators since September 16, 1999;
               vi. Personnel training to perform product failure, and corrective and preventive action assessment activities; and
               vii. Procedures for the Corrective and Preventive Action ("CAPA") system, including, but not limited to: implementing and verifying or validating corrective actions in accordance with 21 C.F.R.  820.75 and 820.1(a)(3); establishing appropriate time frames; conducting and documenting adequate failure investigations; implementing an effective complaint handling system; and properly integrating international databases. The Expert may choose to conduct separate inspections for the methods, processes, and controls for the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps, and provide separate certification reports for each device.
          D. Defendants report to FDA in writing the actions they have taken to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used to manufacture, process, pack, repack, label, hold, and distribute the Infusion Pumps are operated and administered and will be continuously operated and administered in conformity with 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and this decree. This report shall include an evaluation of Baxter's current state of compliance with respect to the CGMP and QS Regulation deviations brought to Baxter's attention in writing by FDA and/or FDA investigators since September 16, 1999. Defendants may choose
 
to provide separate reports to FDA for the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps for purposes of complying with this paragraph.
          E. Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of Defendants' report(s) under paragraph 10(D), FDA may, in its discretion and without prior notice, commence an inspection of Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities to determine whether the requirements of this decree have been met, and whether Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities are otherwise operated in conformity with 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, and 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2); and
          F. FDA notifies Defendants in writing that Defendants appear to be in compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs 10(A)-(E).
          G. If Defendants have satisfied the criteria under paragraphs 10(A)-(F) for the resumption of operations with respect to one infusion pump (e.g., Colleague), but not the other (e.g., Syndeo), FDA shall issue the notice under subparagraph (F) to Defendants with respect to the infusion pump satisfying the criteria set forth in this paragraph notwithstanding the fact that the other infusion pump may not have satisfied such criteria.
     11. Paragraph 10 of this Decree shall not apply to the following:
          A. Any Infusion Pumps and components thereof manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, or held for sale at Defendants' Infusion Pump facilities located in Singapore ("Singapore Infusion Pump Facilities") are excluded from paragraph 10, insofar and so long as the Singapore Infusion Pump Facilities manufacture and distribute Infusion Pumps and components thereof only to countries other than the United States or that are intended for export from the United States as set forth in paragraph 11(B). However, Defendants' Singapore Infusion Pump Facilities
 
are enjoined under paragraph 10 from, either directly or indirectly, causing the introduction into interstate commerce of the Infusion Pumps, and/or components thereof.
          B. Any Infusion Pumps or components thereof manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, held for sale, or introduced into interstate commerce solely for export from the United States, provided that the applicable requirements of 21 U.S.C.  381(e) have been satisfied with respect to any such device or component;
          C. Any Infusion Pumps, or components, parts, or accessories thereto, whose manufacture or processing is not intended for human use and is undertaken for the purpose of developing, testing, verifying, or validating design changes or modifications in accordance with 21 C.F.R.  820.75, 820.1(a)(3), and 820.30(f)-(g), and revised production and process controls, revised manufacturing procedures, or the adequacy of corrective and preventive actions;
sole
          D. Any Infusion Pump, component, part, or accessory that is manufactured, processed, packaged, held for sale, or distributed for the purpose of responding to a written request or written order to provide either routine service maintenance, or to replace components, parts, or accessories for the Infusion Pumps that were already in the possession of customers of Baxter prior to October 12, 2005 or otherwise placed in distribution pursuant to paragraphs 11(E) or 11(F); provided, however, that: (a) Baxter shall send a copy of the notification letter attached hereto as Exhibit A to customers upon providing such routine service maintenance or replacing components, parts, or accessories as set forth herein; (b) any Infusion Pump furnished by Defendants to a customer under this subparagraph shall be the identical device (same model and serial number) that Defendants received from the customer and (c) that Baxter shall maintain a record, and shall allow FDA access to such record upon request, of all such requests or orders and "ship to" records,
solely
 
which records must include the following: (1) a detailed description of the requested service maintenance; (2) the date of any such request or order; (3) the dates of service; (4) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons/entities making any such request or order; and (5) a description of Infusion Pump (model and serial number) the components, parts, or accessories used to provide service maintenance. Provided further, however, Baxter shall not be required to provide the notification letter (Exhibit A) to an entity or person with respect to any serviced or repaired pump that has been previously upgraded or modified pursuant to the corrective action plan approved pursuant to paragraph 14 below;
          E. Any Infusion Pumps or components thereof manufactured, imported, or distributed pursuant to, and in conformity with a written authorization for medically necessary products as provided by FDA to Baxter pursuant to this subparagraph. Baxter may submit a detailed written request to FDA seeking authorization to distribute Infusion Pumps it believes are medically necessary products. A product is considered to be medically necessary if it is used to treat or prevent a serious disease or medical condition and there is no other available source of that product or alternative product that is judged by FDA to be an adequate substitute. Baxter's written request to FDA shall be signed by senior Baxter officers, including at least one corporate medical officer, and include, at least, the following information in its request: (a) the name of pump(s) and model number(s); (b) data identifying Baxter's market share and the market share for all alternative products used for the potentially medically necessary use; (c) the number of pumps in distribution and available in the market chain; (d) the name and contact information of appropriate medical personnel reporting device shortages in their facility; (e) supporting facts and documentation for Baxter's claim that there is a bona fide shortage, the cause and duration of the reported shortage, and that the
 
shortage product is medically necessary; (f) data identifying all other available sources of alternative products that can be substituted for the Baxter device; (g) the medical risks posed by the device shortage; and (h) whether the Baxter device has been cleared for marketing by FDA, and for all such products that have manifested failures and/or defects, the supporting data documenting Baxter's corrective action(s) to remedy such failures and/or defects.
          F. Any Infusion Pumps or components thereof manufactured, imported, or distributed for the purpose of complying with the requirements of paragraph 14 (the corrective action plan provision as set forth in paragraph 14), provided that such Infusion Pumps comply with the requirements set forth in Baxter's corrective action plan after its approval by FDA under paragraph 14.
solely
          G. Any component for the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps whose manufacture, processing, packaging, sale, or distribution has been requested by Baxter in writing to FDA pursuant to this subparagraph and authorized by FDA in writing.
     12. Upon entry of this decree, Defendants and each and all of their officers, directors, agents, representatives, employees, successors, assigns, attorneys, and any and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them (including franchisees, subsidiaries, affiliates, and "doing business as" entities), who have received actual notice of this decree by personal service or otherwise, for so long as such persons are in positions of responsibility with Defendant Baxter or any of Defendant Baxter's franchisees, subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or "doing business as" entities, are permanently enjoined under the provisions of 21 U.S.C.  332(a) from directly or indirectly: (a) causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, of any infusion pump device that is adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.  351(c) and 351(h), or misbranded
 
within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2); and (b) causing infusion pump devices that Defendants hold for sale after shipment of one or more of their components in interstate commerce to become adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.  351(c) and 351(h), or misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2).
     13. After Defendants receive written communication from FDA pursuant to paragraph 10(F), Defendants shall retain an independent person or persons (the "Auditor") to conduct audit inspections of the operations at Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities located in the United States not less than once every six (6) months for a period of one (1) year and not less than once every twelve (12) months for a period of three (3) years thereafter, for a total of four (4) years. The Auditor shall be qualified by education, training, and experience to conduct such inspections, and shall be without personal or financial ties (other than a consulting agreement entered into by the parties) to any of Baxter's officers or employees or their immediate families and may, if Baxter chooses, be the same person or persons described as the Expert in paragraph 10(B).
          A. At the conclusion of each audit inspection, the Auditor shall prepare a written audit report (the "Audit Report") expressing in detail an opinion whether Defendants are in, or are not in, compliance with 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and this decree, and identifying in detail any deviations from 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and this decree ("Audit Report Observations"). As part of every Audit Report, except the first Audit Report, the Auditor shall assess the adequacy of corrective actions taken by Defendants to correct all previous Audit Report Observations, and report in writing the actions to correct each item enumerated in the prior Audit Report(s), and which items have not been corrected, if any. The Audit Reports shall be delivered contemporaneously to Defendants and FDA by courier
 
service or overnight delivery service, no later than twenty-five (25) calendar days after the date the audit inspections are completed. If any Audit Reports identify deviations from 21 U.S.C.  351(h), 21 C.F.R. Part 820, 21 U.S.C.  352(t)(2), and/or this decree, FDA may, in its discretion, require that the auditing cycle be extended for a length of time not to exceed four (4) years. In addition, Defendants shall maintain the complete Audit Reports and all of their underlying data in separate files at their facilities and shall promptly make the Audit Reports and underlying data available to FDA upon request.
          B. If an Audit Report contains any adverse Audit Report Observations, Defendants shall, within thirty-five (35) calendar days of receipt of the Audit Report, correct those observations, unless FDA notifies Defendants that a shorter time period is necessary. If, after receiving the Audit Report, Defendants believe that correction of an adverse Audit Report Observation will take longer than thirty-five (35) calendar days, Defendants shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the Audit Report, propose a schedule for completing corrections ("Correction Schedule") and provide justification describing why the additional time is necessary. That Correction Schedule must be reviewed and approved by FDA in writing prior to implementation. Defendants shall complete all corrections according to the approved Correction Schedule. Within thirty-five (35) calendar days of Defendants' receipt of an Audit Report, or within the time period provided in a Correction Schedule approved by FDA, the Auditor shall review the actions taken by Defendants to correct the adverse Audit Report Observations. Within ten (10) calendar days of the beginning of that review, the Auditor shall report in writing to FDA whether each of the adverse observations has been corrected and, if not, which Audit Report Observations remain uncorrected.
 
          C. The audit inspections and Audit Reports required by this paragraph shall encompass, but not be limited to, the following:
               i. Steps taken by Defendants to identify the root causes, or if not precisely known, the most probable root causes, for the failures with the Infusion Pumps, and an evaluation whether Defendants have implemented appropriate steps to correct and prevent such failures.
               ii. Defendants' procedures for properly and timely reporting adverse events under 21 C.F.R. Part 803;
               iii. Steps taken by management with executive responsibility to ensure continuous implementation of an adequate and effective quality system, including specific written procedures governing management review and quality audits;
               iv. Personnel training to perform product failure and corrective and preventive action assessment activities; and
               v. Procedures for the CAPA system, including, but not limited to: implementing and verifying or validating corrective actions in accordance with 21 C.F.R.  820.75, 820.1(a)(3), and 820.30(f)-(g); establishing appropriate time frames; conducting and documenting adequate failure investigations; and implementing an effective complaint handling system.
     14. Within twenty (20) calendar days after entry of this decree, Defendants shall submit to FDA in writing a detailed Corrective Action Plan to bring the Infusion Pumps currently in use in the United States by physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and other users/facilities into compliance with the Act, its implementing regulations, and this decree. The written Corrective Action Plan shall include, among other things: (a) a description and the supporting documentation for each upgrade,
 
modification, and/or action to be taken for the Infusion Pumps previously distributed; (b) the testing conducted to verify and validate the upgrades and/or modifications in accordance with 21 C.F.R.  820.75, 820.1(a)(3), and 820.30(f)-(g); (c) the projected date on which Defendants will implement and complete the Corrective Action Plan; (d) the manner in which the upgrades and modifications will be made to the Infusion Pumps; (e) whether Infusion Pumps will be recalled to implement corrective actions; (f) identification of the root causes, or if not precisely known, the most probable root causes, of the failures with the Infusion Pumps; and (g) a clear statement whether Defendants' believe the proposed upgrades and modifications to the Infusion Pumps proposed in the Corrective Action Plan require premarket clearance from FDA, the reasons for that belief, and whether premarket clearance has been sought and obtained by Defendants. Defendants shall not initiate the Corrective Action Plan until FDA has first provided Defendants with written authorization to do so.
     FDA shall respond in writing within forty-five (45) calendar days of FDA's receipt of Baxter's Corrective Action Plan and notify Baxter in writing whether the proposed plan is acceptable. If FDA finds the plan unacceptable, it shall state the basis for finding the proposed plan unacceptable in writing, and Defendants shall submit a revised Corrective Action Plan in writing within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of FDA's response. FDA's decision regarding the adequacy of Defendants' Corrective Action Plan shall be final.
     Defendants shall commence the implementation of the Corrective Action Plan within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving FDA's written authorization. Defendants shall, beginning one month after the date on which implementation of the Corrective Action Plan has begun, and continuing until its completion, submit to FDA monthly written progress reports updating the status of the Corrective Action Plan. Defendants shall use their best efforts to locate all Infusion Pumps in use
 
by health care professionals in the United States and to obtain the cooperation of such users to implement the corrective actions required by this paragraph. If Defendants have not obtained FDA authorization for the Corrective Action Plan within twelve (12) months after the date this decree is entered, then FDA may take any action(s) it deems appropriate under paragraph 15 of this decree.
     15. If, at any time after this decree has been entered, FDA determines, based on the results of an inspection, sample analysis, a report or data prepared or submitted by Defendants, the Expert, or the Auditor pursuant to this decree, or any other information, that Defendants have failed to comply with any provision of this decree, or have violated the Act or its regulations, or that additional corrective actions are necessary to achieve compliance with this decree or the Act, FDA may, as and when it deems necessary, order Defendants in writing to take appropriate actions with respect to the Infusion Pumps or components thereof located in or to be distributed into the United States, including but not limited to, the following:
          A. With respect to Infusion Pump Facilities located in the United States, cease the manufacture, processing, packing, repacking, labeling, holding, and interstate distribution of any or all the Infusion Pumps or components thereof;
          B. Cease importing, directly or indirectly, any or all of the Infusion Pumps or components thereof;
          C. Revise, modify, or expand any report(s) or plan(s) prepared pursuant to the decree;
          D. Submit additional reports or information to FDA;
 
          E. Recall, at Defendants' sole expense, specified adulterated or misbranded Infusion Pumps manufactured, distributed, or sold by Defendants or that are under the custody and control of Defendants' agents, distributors, customers, or consumers;
          F. Issue a safety alert; and/or
          G. Take any other corrective action(s) as FDA, in its discretion, deems necessary to protect the public health or to bring Defendants into compliance with the Act, its implementing regulations, and this decree.
     16. A. Any order issued by FDA pursuant to paragraph 15 shall be issued by the appropriate FDA District Director, and shall specify the failures giving rise to the order. Unless a different time frame is specified by FDA in its order, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving an order pursuant to paragraph 15, Defendants shall notify FDA in writing either that (1) Defendants are undertaking or have undertaken corrective action, in which event Defendants also shall describe the specific action taken or to be taken and the proposed schedule for completing the action; or (2) Defendants do not agree with FDA's order. If Defendants notify FDA that they do not agree with FDA's order, Defendants shall explain in writing the basis for their disagreement; in so doing, Defendants also may propose specific alternative actions and specific time frames for achieving FDA's objectives.
          B. If Defendants notify FDA that they do not agree with FDA's order, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving Defendants' response, FDA will review Defendants' notification and thereafter, in writing, affirm, modify, or withdraw its order, as the Agency deems appropriate. If FDA affirms or modifies its order, it shall explain the basis for its decisions in writing. The written notice of affirmance shall constitute final agency action.
 
          C. If FDA affirms or modifies its order, Defendants shall, upon receipt of FDA's order, immediately implement the order (as modified, if applicable), and, if they so choose, bring the matter before this court on an expedited basis. Defendants shall continue to diligently implement FDA's order unless the court reverses or modifies FDA's order. Any review of FDA's decision under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the terms set forth in paragraph 26.
     17. Any cessation of operations or other action described in paragraphs 15-16 shall continue until Defendants receive written notification from FDA that Defendants appear to be in compliance with this decree, the Act, and its implementing regulations. The costs of FDA inspections, sampling, testing, travel time, and subsistence expenses to implement the remedies set forth in this paragraph and paragraphs 15-16 shall be borne by Defendant Baxter at the rates specified in paragraph 20.
     18. Defendants represent that they do not currently manufacture or distribute any other infusion pumps that have any of the following components and device specifications in common with the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps: software systems, computer motherboards, processors, sensors, timing circuitry, power systems, and pumping mechanisms. If Defendant Baxter intends to manufacture or distribute an infusion pump(s) with any of the above-listed components in common with the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps, it shall notify FDA ninety (90) days prior to distribution of the device and describe in detail the use of the same components.
     19. Representatives of FDA shall be permitted, without prior notice and as and when FDA deems necessary, to make inspections of Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities, and take any other measures necessary to monitor and to ensure continuing compliance with the terms of this decree. During such inspections, FDA representatives shall be permitted: access to buildings, equipment,
 
in-process and finished materials, containers, and labeling therein; to take photographs and make video recordings; to take samples of Defendants' materials and products, containers, and labeling; and to examine and copy all records relating to the receipt, manufacture, processing, packing, labeling, holding, and distribution of any and all devices. FDA will provide Defendants with a receipt for any samples taken pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  374 and upon Defendants request and at Defendants' own expense, with copies of any photographs or video recordings made. The inspections shall be permitted upon presenting a copy of this decree and appropriate credentials. The inspection authority granted by this decree is separate from, and in addition to, the authority to make inspections under the Act, 21 U.S.C.  374.
     20. Defendant Baxter shall reimburse FDA for the costs of all FDA inspections, investigations, supervision, reviews, examinations, and analyses that FDA deems necessary to evaluate Defendants' compliance with this decree. The costs of such inspections shall be borne by Defendant Baxter at the prevailing rates in effect at the time the costs are incurred. As of the date that this decree is signed by the parties, these rates are: $76.10 per hour and fraction thereof per representative for inspection work; $91.18 per hour or fraction thereof per representative for analytical or review work; $0.445 per mile for travel expenses by automobile; government rate or the equivalent for travel by air or other means; and the published government per diem rate or the equivalent for the areas in which the inspections are performed per-day, per-representative for subsistence expenses, where necessary. FDA shall submit a reasonably detailed bill of costs to Baxter at the address specified in paragraph 23. In the event that the standard rates applicable to FDA supervision of court-ordered compliance are modified, these rates shall be increased or decreased without further order of the court.
 
     21. Within ten (10) calendar days after the entry of this decree, Defendants shall provide a copy of this decree, by personal service or certified mail (restricted delivery, return receipt requested), to each and all of its directors, officers, agents, representatives, successors, assigns, attorneys, and any and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them (including individuals, directors, corporations, subsidiaries, franchisees, affiliates, partnerships, and "doing business as" entities) with responsibilities for the manufacture and quality of the Infusion Pumps (hereafter, collectively referred to as "Associated Persons"). In the event that Defendant Baxter becomes associated, at any time after the entry of this decree, with new Associated Persons, Defendants shall (a) within fifteen (15) calendar days of such association, provide a copy of this decree to such person(s) by personal service or certified mail (restricted delivery, return receipt requested) and (b) on a quarterly basis, notify FDA in writing when, how, and to whom the decree was provided. Within twenty (20) calendar days after entry of this decree, Defendants shall provide a copy of this decree to all of Defendants' employees involved in the manufacture, processing, packing, storage, or distribution of the Infusion Pumps, by posting a copy of this decree on Baxter's intranet Web site in such a manner to ensure that it will be viewed by such employees, and shall prominently post a copy of this decree in the employee common areas at all facilities where such employees are located. Baxter shall ensure that the decree remains posted on Baxter's intranet and in the employee common areas for no less than twelve (12) months. Within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the date of entry of this decree, Defendant Baxter shall provide to FDA an affidavit of compliance, stating the fact and manner of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph and identifying the names and positions of all persons who initially received a copy of this decree and the manner of notification.
 
     22. Defendants shall notify the District Director, FDA Chicago District Office, in writing at least fifteen (15) calendar days before any change in ownership, character, or name of its business, such as dissolution, assignment, or sale resulting in the emergence of a successor corporation, the creation or dissolution of subsidiaries, franchisees, affiliates, or "doing business as" entities, or any other change in the corporate structure of the companies or in the sale or assignment of any business assets, such as buildings, equipment, or inventory, that may affect compliance with this decree. Defendants shall provide a copy of this decree to any potential successor or assignee at least fifteen (15) calendar days before any sale or assignment. Defendants shall furnish FDA with an affidavit of compliance with this paragraph no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to such assignment or change in ownership.
     23. All notifications, correspondence, and communications required to be sent to FDA by the terms of this decree shall be addressed to the District Director, FDA Chicago District Office, 550 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60661. All notifications, correspondence, and communications required to be sent to Defendants by the terms of this decree shall be addressed to the Director of the Consent Decree Compliance Task Force at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, IL 60015.
     24. If Defendants fail to comply with any of the provisions of this decree, including any time frame imposed by this decree, then, on motion of the United States in this proceeding, Defendant Baxter shall pay to the United States of America fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) in liquidated damages for each day such violation continues and an additional sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) in liquidated damages for each violation of the Act, its implementing regulations,
 
and/or this decree. The amount of liquidated damages in this paragraph shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in any one calendar year.
     25. Should the United States bring, and prevail in, a contempt action to enforce the terms of this decree, Defendants shall, in addition to other remedies, reimburse the United States for its attorneys' fees, investigational expenses, expert witness fees, travel expenses incurred by attorneys and witnesses, and administrative court costs relating to such contempt proceedings.
     26. All decisions conferred upon FDA in this decree shall be vested in the sole discretion of FDA, which discretion shall be reviewed, if contested, under the arbitrary and capricious standard set forth in 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A) and shall be based exclusively upon the written record that was before FDA at the time of the decision. No discovery may be had by either party.
     27. If Defendants petition the court for relief from this decree and, at the time of the petition, in FDA's judgment, Defendants have maintained at Baxter's Infusion Pump Facilities a state of continuous compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this decree for the sixty (60) months preceding the petition and following entry of this decree, Plaintiff will not oppose such petition.
     28. This court retains jurisdiction of this action for the purpose of enforcing or modifying this decree and for the purpose of granting such additional relief as may be necessary or appropriate.

<BAXTER LETTERHEAD>
<DATE>
Subject: Colleague Volumetric Infusion Pump and Syndeo Infusion Pump
Dear Customer:
On ___2006, Baxter signed a Consent Decree for Condemnation and Permanent Injunction enjoining the manufacture and distribution of Colleague Volumetric Infusion Pumps and Syndeo Infusion Pumps. Under paragraph 11(D) of the consent decree, Baxter is authorized to: (a) continue providing , or (b) to replace components, parts, or accessories for the Colleague and Syndeo infusion pumps . These pumps have been the subject of various recalls and notices available at , including Baxter's July 20, 2005, Urgent Product Recall of Colleague Volumetric Infusion Pumps (attached) asking you to remove from service any Colleague infusion pump exhibiting the failure codes listed in that communication. Baxter also issued an Important Product Information Letter dated July 6, 2005 (attached), for the Syndeo infusion pump asking you to remove from service Syndeo pumps exhibiting certain failure codes or failing to power on properly.
routine service maintenance
that were already in the possession of customers of Baxter prior to October 12, 2005
www.baxter.com
Baxter continues to pursue a permanent fix for these issues and will notify you once an implementation schedule has been finalized in accordance with the terms set forth in the consent decree. As part of servicing your pump, Baxter has reviewed the event history for all of the failure codes in the July 20, 2005 letter, and replaced the PC Board on all pumps that have demonstrated one of the failure codes. Baxter has also implemented a more rigorous inspection and testing process for the pumps that have had a new PC Board installed.
While the Colleague and Syndeo Infusion Pumps serviced by Baxter have been inspected to reduce the likelihood of future failures, this inspection will not completely eliminate the possibility of future occurrences. It is recommended that users be vigilant in monitoring pump usage to ensure that these failure codes do not occur on these or other pumps within your possession. If a pump is found to have any of the stated failure codes, it should be taken out of service and returned to Baxter for repair.
As stated in the July 6 and July 20, 2005 notices, the Colleague and Syndeo infusion pumps will alarm, stop infusing, and display a failure code if they detect an abnormal situation. Because this situation can occur during an infusion, it is imperative that institutions have a contingency plan to mitigate any disruptions during infusion therapy (as discussed more fully in the attachments). Additionally, you should consider not using these pumps in situations where a replacement pump is not available or where a delay in therapy might adversely affect patient health.
 
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to your institution. <Insert Baxter contact information; telephone number>

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On July 20, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items and the impact of stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R is excluded to provide a comparison to prior periods that have not been restated to include such expenses. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99 BAXTER'S SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS BAXTER RAISES FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE REFLECTING STRONG FIRST-HALF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUED MOMENTUM DEERFIELD, Ill., July 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today announced stronger-than-expected growth in sales and earnings for the second quarter and raised its full-year guidance to reflect the company's strong first-half operating performance and continued momentum. Excluding special items, Baxter reported second quarter income from continuing operations of $373 million, an increase of 21 percent from $309 million in 2005. On a GAAP basis, Baxter reported income from continuing operations of $309 million, compared to $324 million reported in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 16 percent to $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $0.49 in the prior-year period. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.47 compares to $0.51 per diluted share reported in the second quarter last year.
The company's financial results reflect strong operational performance, better-than-expected sales, continued expansion of gross and operating margins, and lower interest expense. Excluding the impact of stock-option expense of approximately $0.02 per diluted share under SFAS No. 123-R, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.59 compares favorably with the guidance that Baxter previously provided for the quarter of $0.54 to $0.56 (which also excluded stock-option expense). Special items in the second quarter included a previously announced $64 million (or $0.10 per diluted share) after-tax charge associated with the COLLEAGUE Volumetric Infusion Pump remediation efforts. Special items impacting the second quarter 2005 results included an $80 million (or $0.12 per diluted share) after-tax benefit from adjustments to Baxter's restructuring charges and a $65 million (or $0.10 per diluted share) after-tax charge for COLLEAGUE remediation efforts. Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.6 billion in the second quarter and increased 3 percent, or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This compares favorably to the guidance the company previously provided of organic sales growth, which excluded the impact of foreign exchange, of 2 to 3 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, and sales outside of the United States also grew 3 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Driving the company's sales performance was the BioScience business, with record quarterly sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of 13 percent. Momentum continued to build for several products used for the treatment of immune disorders and hemophilia, including Baxter's portfolio of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products and ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and specialty biosurgery products used in the areas of hemostasis, tissue sealing and tissue repair.
Renal sales increased 2 percent to $516 million. Global peritoneal dialysis (PD) sales increased 5 percent (or 6 percent on an organic basis) as a result of growth in the number of patients using PD, a home-therapy for the treatment of end-stage renal disease, particularly in international markets. Offsetting this growth was a decline in lower-margin hemodialysis (HD) products. Medication Delivery sales were $1.0 billion, down 7 percent, primarily due to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump hold and generic drug competition. Research and development (R&D) spending totaled $146 million in the second quarter, an increase of 10 percent. The company has accelerated spending across all its businesses, with particular emphasis on its BioScience business where R&D spending increased by more than 15 percent over last year. "We are extremely pleased with our operational and financial performance in the first half of the year, as we realize the benefits from our ongoing margin improvement initiatives," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "With our financial results exceeding our first-half objectives, we now have additional flexibility to not only deliver growth in the near term, but to accelerate our investments in R&D and select marketing activities to drive future value for our shareholders."
Baxter recently announced several initiatives that leverage the company's unique technology platforms and further expand its global presence. These initiatives include: -- U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and U.S. launch of an ultra-high dosage strength of ADVATE for Hemophilia A, making it easier for people requiring higher doses to administer ADVATE by reducing both the infusion volume of drug solution and the storage space; and the launch in Canada of GAMMAGARD Liquid [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] 10 % Solution. -- A tender from the U.S. government, through a contract award to DVC LLC, to develop cell-culture based influenza vaccines. Baxter will develop seasonal and pandemic vaccines using the company's vero-cell technology and has recently initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial to test a candidate H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in Austria and Singapore. -- Tentative approvals from the FDA for Ondansetron Injection USP, a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's Zofran, in vial and premix presentations. -- The commercial availability of HYLENEX, a liquid injectable formulation of recombinant human hyaluronidase, in the U.S. Six-Month Results For the first six months of 2006, Baxter's adjusted income from continuing operations was $655 million, or $1.00 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, Baxter's income from continuing operations for the first half of 2006 totaled $591 million, or $0.90 per diluted share. For the first six months of 2006, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 2 percent to $5.1 billion, up from $5.0 billion in the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, organic sales growth for the first half of the year was 4 percent. Domestic sales totaled $2.2 billion, an increase of 2 percent over the same period last year, and international sales also grew 2 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $2.8 billion.
Cash flow from operations totaled $848 million for the first six months of the year, compared to $778 million in the same period in 2005. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $198 million in 2006) was $650 million for the first half of 2006, reflecting an improvement of approximately $35 million from the same period last year. "As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on improving our working capital management and driving a return-on-invested-capital discipline throughout the company," said Robert M. Davis, chief financial officer. "Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, we have increased flexibility to balance business investments that enhance our longer-term growth with our continued commitment to return value to our shareholders using a disciplined capital-allocation framework." Third Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Guidance Given the company's strong financial performance in the first six months of the year, Baxter is raising its full-year 2006 guidance. For full-year 2006, the company now expects to achieve organic sales growth of approximately 6 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $2.13 to $2.17, before special items (or $2.03 to $2.07 on a GAAP basis). Excluding special items and the impact of stock-option expense of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, Baxter expects adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.21 to $2.25, which compares favorably to the company's most recent full-year earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.16 on a comparable basis. In addition, the company now expects cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to approach $2.0 billion, with free cash flow in excess of $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures).
For the third quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to grow 6 to 7 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $0.55 to $0.57, before any special items.

This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: future actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the FDA and foreign counterparts that could limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sales or result in sanctions; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; the ability to enforce company patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website.

     (b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
CONTRIBUTION

A Participant may change the form of payment designated on his or her Distribution Election Form from time to time in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator; provided that (i) distribution of the Account following the change shall commence not earlier than five years after the distribution would otherwise have begun, and (ii) if the Participant incurs a Termination within 12 months after changing the form of payment designated, other than by reason of death, the change shall be disregarded and his/her Account shall be distributed in accordance with the form of payment designated prior to the change.
Distribution Election Form  Termination.
          B. . Prior to January 1, 2005, a Participant could elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Account at a specified future date, by filing a Distribution Election Form with the Compensation Committee, specifying the dollar amount of the distribution, at least 12 months prior to the distribution date. Effective January 1, 2005, such in-service distributions are no longer permitted. In-service distributions shall be made in accordance with Distribution Election Forms filed within the 12 month period prior to January 1, 2005, but in no event shall the amount of any such in-service election exceed the Participant's total account balance as of December 31, 2004. If the balance in the Participant's Account on the specified distribution date is less than the dollar amount requested, the entire balance of the Account shall be distributed. If the Participant has a Termination prior to the
In-Service Distribution
 
specific date requested on such Distribution Election Form, such form shall be ignored and the Participant's distribution election with respect to Termination shall be followed.
          C. The forms of distribution are:
Forms of Distribution.
(a) a lump sum payment, or
(b) annual installments of at least 2 years, but not to exceed 15 years.
Annual installments will commence in the first quarter of the Plan Year as specified in the Participant's Deferral Election Form or Distribution Election Form. Subsequent installments will be paid annually in the first quarter of subsequent Plan Years, and each installment shall be equal to the remaining balance in the Participant's Account immediately prior to such payment divided by the number of installments remaining to be paid. Lump sum payments will be made in the first quarter of the Plan Year as specified in the Participant's Deferral Election Form.
Lump sum payments pursuant to a Distribution Election Form relating to payments following Termination will be made in the first quarter following the Plan Year in which the Participant incurs a Termination or any subsequent Plan Year as indicated on the Distribution Election Form. All distributions of a Participant's Account prior to Termination of Employment will be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after the date elected by the Participant in the Distribution Election Form.
If a Participant does not elect a form of distribution by the time the Deferral Election Form or the Distribution Election Form is required to be completed, the Participant's election will default to a lump sum payment in the first quarter of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant incurs a Termination of Employment.
Notwithstanding the above, a Participant whose Account totals less than $50,000 as of the last day of the Plan Year in which he or she incurs a Termination will receive lump sum payment of his or her Account in the first quarter of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant incurs a Termination.
The Administrator has the right to postpone the payment of any Account for up to one year from the date on which the credits would otherwise be paid.
     5.3 . Payment to the person, trust or other entity reasonably and in good faith determined by the Administrator to be the Participant's Beneficiary will completely discharge any obligations Baxter or any other Employer may have under the Plan. If a Plan benefit is payable to a minor or a person declared to be incompetent or to a person the Administrator in good faith believes to be incompetent or incapable of handling the disposition of property, the Administrator may direct payment of such Plan benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor and such decision by the Administrator is binding on all parties. The Administrator may initiate whatever action it deems appropriate to ensure that benefits are properly paid to an appropriate guardian.
Effect of Payment
 
The Administrator may require proof of incompetence, minority, incapacity or guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the Plan benefit. Such distribution will completely discharge the Administrator and the Employer from all liability with respect to such benefit.
     5.4 . It is intended that each Participant will be taxed on amounts credited to him or her under the Plan at the time such amounts are received, and the provisions of the Plan will be interpreted consistent with that intention.
Taxation of Plan Benefits
     5.5 . Baxter will withhold from payments made hereunder any taxes required to be withheld for the payment of taxes to the Federal, or any state or local government.
Withholding and Payroll Taxes
     5.6 . Upon written request of a Participant and the showing of Unforeseeable Emergency, the Administrator may authorize distribution of all or a portion of the Participant's Accounts, and or the acceleration of any installment payments being made from the Plan, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to relieve the Unforeseeable Emergency. In any event, payment may not be made to the extent such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be satisfied through reimbursement by insurance or otherwise, including, but not limited to, liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent that such liquidation would not in and of itself cause severe financial hardship. In addition, such Participant is precluded from enrolling in the Plan for the entire Plan Year beginning January 1 after the request is approved.
Distribution Due to Unforeseeable Emergency
 
     6.1 . Each Participant has the right to designate one or more persons, trusts or, with the Administrator's approval, other entity as the Participant's Beneficiary, primary as well as secondary, to whom benefits under this Plan will be paid in the event of the Participant's death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation will be in a written form prescribed by the Administrator and will be effective only when filed with the Administrator during the Participant's lifetime.
Beneficiary Designation
     6.2 . Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant without the consent of any Beneficiary by the filing of a new Beneficiary designation with the Administrator. Filing a Beneficiary designation as to any benefits available under the Plan revokes all prior Beneficiary designations effective as of the date such Beneficiary designation is received by the Administrator. If a Participant's Account is community property, any Beneficiary designation will be valid or effective only as permitted under applicable law.
Amendments to Beneficiary Designation
     6.3 . In the absence of an effective Beneficiary designation, or if all Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, the Participant's estate will be the Beneficiary. If a Beneficiary dies after the Participant and before payment of benefits under this Plan has been completed, and no secondary Beneficiary has been designated to receive such Beneficiary's share, the remaining benefits will be payable to the Beneficiary's estate.
No Beneficiary Designation
 
     7.1 . The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, which shall be the Administrator for all purposes of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all authority to administer the Plan on an ongoing basis, including the authority to adopt and implement all rules and procedures for the administration of the Plan, shall be exercised by such persons as may be designated by the Corporate Vice President-Human Resources of Baxter, subject to the authority of the Compensation Committee, and all references to the Administrator herein shall, as appropriate, be construed to refer to such person or persons.

The Administrator is empowered to employ agents (who may also be employees of Baxter) and to delegate to them any of the administrative duties imposed upon the Administrator or Baxter
Administrator Powers
     7.3 . Any ruling, regulation, procedure or decision of the Administrator will be conclusive and binding upon all persons affected by it. There will be no appeal from any ruling by the Administrator which is within its authority, except as provided in Section 7.4 below.
Finality of Decisions
     7.4 . Any claim for benefits by a Participant, his or her Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, or any other person claiming the right to receive any benefit from the Plan by reason of his or her relationship to a Participant or Beneficiary (the "applicant") shall be in writing and filed in accordance with procedures specified by the Administrator not more than one year after the claimant knows or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the basis for the claim. If the claim is denied, the Administrator will furnish the applicant within a reasonable period of time with a written notice which specifies the reason for the denial, and explains the claim review procedures of this Section 7.4. If, within 60 days after receipt of such notice, the applicant so requests in writing, the Administrator will review its earlier decision. The Administrator's decision on review will be in writing, will include specific reasons for the decision, and will be given to the claimant with a reasonable period of time after the request for review is received. By participating in the Plan, each Participant agrees, on behalf of himself or herself and all persons claiming through him or her, not to commence any action or proceeding for payment of any amount claimed to be due under the Plan without first complying with the foregoing procedures.
Claims Procedure
 
     7.5 . To the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that they are not indemnified or saved harmless under any liability insurance contracts, any present or former employees, officers, or directors of Baxter, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, if any, will be indemnified and saved harmless by Baxter from and against any and all liabilities or allegations of liability to which they may be subjected by reason of any act done or omitted to be done in good faith in the administration of the Plan, including all expenses reasonably incurred in their defense in the event that Baxter fails to provide such defense after having been requested in writing to do so.
Indemnity

Payment at Termination
 
     9.1 . This Plan is intended to be an unfunded deferred compensation plan. All credited amounts are unfunded, general obligations of Baxter.

Unfunded Plan
     9.2 . In the event of Baxter's insolvency, Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns will have no legal or equitable rights, interest or claims in any property or assets of Baxter or any of its subsidiaries, nor will they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by such Baxter (the "Policies") greater than those of any other unsecured general creditors. In that event, any and all of Baxter's assets and Policies will be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of Baxter. Baxter's obligation under the Plan will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of Baxter to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
     9.3 . Neither a Participant nor any other person will have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable will, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency. Nothing contained herein will preclude Baxter from offsetting any amount owed to it by a Participant against payments to such Participant or his or her Beneficiary.
Nonassignability
     9.4 . A Participant will cooperate with Baxter by furnishing any and all information requested by Baxter, in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder.

Governing Law
     9.6 . In the event any provision of the Plan is held invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, but the Plan will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted, and Baxter will have the privilege and opportunity to correct and remedy such questions of illegality or invalidity by amendment as provided in the Plan, including, but not by way of limitation, the opportunity to construe and enforce the Plan as if such illegal and invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

Notice
 
registered or certified mail to Baxter's Chief Financial Officer and, if mailed, will be addressed to the principal executive offices of Baxter. Notice to a Participant or Beneficiary may be hand delivered or mailed to the Participant or Beneficiary at his or her most recent address as listed in the employment records of Baxter. Notices will be deemed given as of the date of delivery or mailing or, if delivery is made by certified or registered mail, as of the date shown on the receipt for registration or certification. Any person entitled to notice hereunder may waive such notice.
     9.8 . The provisions of this Plan will bind and inure to the benefit of Baxter, the Participants and Beneficiaries, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On October 19, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS STRONG EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WITH EPS OF $0.57 PER SHARE BAXTER RAISES FULL-YEAR EPS GUIDANCE DEERFIELD, Ill., Oct. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported strong growth in earnings for the third quarter driven by accelerated revenue growth, continued improvement in operational performance, expansion of gross and operating margins, and lower interest expense. Baxter's third quarter net income of $374 million increased from $116 million in 2005. Earnings per diluted share of $0.57 increased from $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period, and were at the high end of the guidance range previously provided by the company of $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items recorded in the prior year period, third quarter net income increased 26 percent from $296 million in 2005 and earnings per diluted share increased 21 percent from $0.47 per diluted share. In the third quarter last year, the company recorded $180 million (or $0.29 per diluted share) for charges associated with the exit of hemodialysis instrument manufacturing and for the tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.6 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 7 percent, or 6 percent excluding the benefit from foreign exchange. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, and sales outside of the United States increased 9 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Contributing to sales growth was Baxter's BioScience business, with sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent. Driving this performance was growth from several products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and Baxter's portfolio of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), as well as solid growth from other plasma-based therapies and biosurgery products. Renal sales increased 6 percent to $519 million in the third quarter due to continued gains in peritoneal dialysis patients. Medication Delivery sales declined 1 percent to $950 million as a result of generic drug competition. "I'm particularly pleased with the continued and balanced improvement in margins across all of our businesses. This is a strength of our diversified model, and provides leverage for us to continue to accelerate investments to grow our company," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Baxter. "Over the company's 75-year history, Baxter has pioneered many technological and therapeutic breakthroughs for the benefit of patients worldwide, and with our renewed investments in the company, we expect to continue to drive future benefits and value for both patients and shareholders."
Recent Highlights Baxter has recently announced several initiatives and milestones that leverage the company's unique technology platforms, further expand its global presence and focus its resources and investments on areas that provide long-term strategic value. These include: -- Preliminary results from the company's Phase I/II clinical trial of whole-virus H5N1 influenza candidate vaccine, which suggest that the vaccine is well-tolerated in humans and it can induce antibodies that neutralize widely divergent strains of H5N1. -- Approval from regulatory authorities in Canada and Australia to begin marketing ADVATE. ADVATE is now approved for use in 31 countries around the world. -- Re-launching the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump in all key markets outside the United States. Baxter has now completed the remediation of the majority of infusion pumps currently in use outside the United States, and is awaiting FDA approval of its corrective action plan in the United States. -- Signing a definitive agreement for the sale of the Transfusion Therapies business for $540 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the company expects to close the transaction by the first quarter of 2007. Nine-Month Results For the first nine months of 2006, Baxter's net income totaled $965 million and increased 45 percent, with earnings per diluted share of $1.47, which increased 39 percent. On an adjusted basis, Baxter's net income of $1.0 billion increased 24 percent from $829 million last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the nine-month period of $1.57 increased 19 percent from $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year period. Details related to charges recorded in both nine-month periods can be found on the supplemental schedule on page 10 of this release. In the nine-month period, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 3 percent to $7.6 billion, up from $7.4 billion last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, organic sales growth for the first nine months of the year was 4 percent. Domestic sales totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, and international sales grew 4 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $4.3 billion. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.4 billion for the nine-month period, compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2005. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $336 million through the third quarter of 2006) was $1.1 billion, reflecting an improvement of $50 million from the same period last year.
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Guidance For full-year 2006, the company expects to achieve organic sales growth of approximately 6 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $2.17 to $2.19, before special items (or $2.07 to $2.09 on a GAAP basis). In addition, the company expects cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to approach $2.0 billion, with free cash flow in excess of $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the fourth quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to grow 7 to 8 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $0.60 to $0.62, before any special items.

This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; future actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the FDA and foreign counterparts that could limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sales or result in sanctions; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; the ability to enforce company patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; failure to obtain necessary consents or to satisfy other closing conditions related to the sale of the Transfusion Therapies business; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements. Financial schedules are attached to this release and available on the company's website.

Credit Agreement
Borrower
          I am Associate General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
          In that connection I have examined:
          (1) The Credit Agreement.
          (2) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower as in effect on the date hereof (the "").
Charter
          (3) The Bylaws of the Borrower, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the "").

          (5) All of the other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.01
          I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the Borrower's material agreements as identified on the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and any subsequent filings on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K with the
 
Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the ""). In addition, I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
Material Agreements
          1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.
          2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
          3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
          4. The Credit Agreement and the Notes are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
          5. Except as disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no pending or, to my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
          6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
          (a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
 
          (b) The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, except for the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to the opinions given in paragraphs 1 and 2. For purposes of the opinion given in paragraph 4 it is assumed, with your permission, that the governing law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois.
          (c) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          (d) I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes, (ii) or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

     (e) Effective as of December 20, 2006, certain executive officers of Baxter International Inc. (the "") entered into severance agreements in the form attached hereto as . It is expected that all of the Company's named executive officers other than the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (who is party to a previously filed employment agreement) will enter into severance agreements in substantially the form attached.
Company
Exhibit 10.1
     The form of severance agreement provides that if a Change in Control of the Company occurs and as a result the named executive officer either is terminated or terminates his employment for Good Reason, such named executive officer will receive a lump sum cash payment generally equal to twice the aggregate amount of such officer's salary and target bonus, and the named executive officer also will be entitled to two years of continued welfare benefit coverage, a pro-rata annual incentive bonus, continued retirement and savings plan accruals for two years, two years of additional age and service credit for retiree welfare benefit purposes, and outplacement expense reimbursement in an amount not exceeding $50,000. The severance agreements also contain non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants binding the named executive officers for two years. A condition for receiving any severance payments under the agreement is the execution by the named executive officer of a customary release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. In the event that the total payments to a named executive officer under the agreement exceed 110% of the largest amount that would result in no portion of the total payments being subject to any excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company will gross-up the severance payments to the officer to cover such excise tax. In the event that the total payments to a named executive officer under the agreement do not exceed 110% of the largest amount that would result in no portion of the total payments being subject to excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the severance payments will be reduced until no portion of the payments is subject to such excise tax.
     A copy of the form of severance agreement attached to this report as is incorporated herein by reference as though it were fully set forth herein. The description above is a summary of the form of severance agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the form of severance agreement itself.

Such post-termination compensation and benefits shall be determined under, and paid in accordance with, the Company's retirement, insurance and other compensation or benefit plans, programs and arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason.
          5.4 Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, notwithstanding any provision of any non-qualified defined contribution deferred compensation plans to the contrary, in lieu of any other benefit under such plans, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the then present value of the deferred compensation otherwise payable to the Executive pursuant to the terms of such plans. The payments required by this Section 5.4 shall be made not later than the fifth day following the date of a Change in Control (or, if later, as soon as practicable following the earliest date that will avoid the imposition of a tax under section 409A of the Code).

Severance Payments
          6.1 Subject to Section 6.2 hereof, if the Executive's employment is terminated following a Change in Control and during the Term, other than (A) by the Company for Cause, (B) by reason of death or Disability, or (C) by the Executive without Good Reason, then the Company shall pay the Executive the amounts, and provide the Executive the benefits, described in this Section 6.1 ("Severance Payments") and Section 6.2 hereof, in addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled under Section 5 hereof, provided that the Executive shall have properly executed and not revoked a customary release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason, if (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs) and such termination was at the request or direction of a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control, (ii) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason prior to a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs) and the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason occurs at the request or direction of such Person, or (iii) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason and such termination or the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason is otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs). For purposes of any determination regarding the
 
applicability of the immediately preceding sentence, any position taken by the Executive shall be presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to the Board by clear and convincing evidence that such position is not correct.
               (A) In lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Executive, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to two times the sum of (i) the Executive's base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (ii) the Executive's target annual bonus under any annual bonus or incentive plan maintained by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which occurs the Date of Termination or, if higher, the highest target annual bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which occurs the Change in Control or the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason.
               (B) For the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following the Date of Termination (or such shorter period as may be required to avoid the imposition of a tax under section 409A of the Code), the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents life, accident and health insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, at no greater after-tax cost to the Executive than the after-tax cost to the Executive immediately prior to such date or occurrence; , , that, unless the Executive consents to a different method, such health insurance benefits shall be provided through a third-party insurer. Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6.1(B) shall be eliminated if benefits of the same type are received by or made available to the Executive during the twenty-four (24) month period following the Executive's termination of employment (and any such benefits received by or made available to the Executive shall be reported to the Company by the Executive). If the Severance Payments shall be decreased pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, and the Section 6.1(B) benefits which remain payable after the application of Section 6.2 hereof are thereafter reduced pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall, no later than five (5) business days following such reduction, pay to the Executive the least of (a) the amount of the decrease made in the Severance Payments pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, (b) the amount of the subsequent reduction in these Section 6.1(B) benefits, or (c) the maximum amount which can be paid to the Executive without being, or causing any other payment to be, nondeductible by reason of section 280G of the Code.
provided
however
 
               (C) Notwithstanding any provision of any annual or long term incentive plan to the contrary, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) any unpaid incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to the Executive for a completed fiscal year or other measuring period preceding the Date of Termination under any such plan and which, as of the Date of Termination, is contingent only upon the continued employment of the Executive to a subsequent date, and (ii) a pro rata portion to the Date of Termination of the aggregate value of all contingent incentive compensation awards to the Executive for all then uncompleted periods under any such plan, calculated as to each such award by multiplying the award that the Executive would have earned on the last day of the performance award period, assuming the achievement, at the target level, of the individual and corporate performance goals established with respect to such award, by the fraction obtained by dividing the number of full months and any fractional portion of a month during such performance award period through the Date of Termination by the total number of months contained in such performance award period.
               (D) In addition to the retirement benefits to which the Executive is entitled under each DB Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the excess of (i) the actuarial equivalent of the aggregate retirement pension (taking into account any early retirement subsidies associated therewith and determined as a straight life annuity commencing at the date (but in no event earlier than the second anniversary of the Date of Termination) as of which the actuarial equivalent of such annuity is greatest) which the Executive would have accrued under the terms of all DB Pension Plans (without regard to any amendment to any DB Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control and on or prior to the Date of Termination, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the computation of retirement benefits thereunder), determined as if the Executive were fully vested thereunder and had accumulated (after the Date of Termination) twenty-four (24) additional months of age and service credit thereunder and had been credited under each DB Pension Plan during such period with compensation equal to the Executive's compensation (as defined in such DB Pension Plan) during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding Date of Termination or, if higher, during the twelve months immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, over (ii) the actuarial equivalent of the aggregate retirement pension (taking into account any early retirement subsidies associated therewith and determined as a straight life annuity commencing at the date (but in no event earlier than the Date of Termination) as of which the actuarial equivalent of such annuity is greatest) which the Executive had accrued pursuant to the provisions of the DB Pension Plans as of the Date of Termination. For purposes of this Section 6.1(D), "actuarial equivalent" shall be determined using the same assumptions utilized under the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Pension Plan immediately prior to the Date of
 
Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. In addition to the benefits to which the Executive is entitled under each DC Pension Plan, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) the amount that would have been contributed thereto by the Company on the Executive's behalf during the two years immediately following the Date of Termination, determined (x) as if the Executive made the maximum permissible contributions thereto during such period, (y) as if the Executive earned compensation during such period at a rate equal to the Executive's compensation (as defined in the DC Pension Plan) during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Date of Termination or, if higher, during the twelve months immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (z) without regard to any amendment to the DC Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control and on or prior to the Date of Termination, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the computation of benefits thereunder, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Executive's account balance under the DC Pension Plan as of the Date of Termination over (y) the portion of such account balance that is nonforfeitable under the terms of the DC Pension Plan.
               (E) If the Executive would have become entitled to benefits under the Company's post-retirement health care or life insurance plans, as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, had the Executive's employment terminated at any time during the period of twenty-four (24) months after the Date of Termination, the Company shall provide such post-retirement health care or life insurance benefits to the Executive and the Executive's dependents commencing on the later of (i) the date on which such coverage would have first become available and (ii) the date on which benefits described in subsection (B) of this Section 6.1 terminate.
               (F) The Company shall provide the Executive with outplacement services suitable to the Executive's position for a period of two years or, if earlier, until the first acceptance by the Executive of an offer of employment, in an aggregate amount not exceeding $50,000.
The lump-sum cash payments required pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 6.1 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination (or on the earliest date that will avoid the imposition of a tax under section 409A of the Code).
 
          6.2 The following special payment provisions shall apply:
               (A) Whether or not the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments, if any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive's employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) (all such payments and benefits, including the Severance Payments, being hereinafter called "Total Payments") will be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax, then, subject to the provisions of subsection (B) of this Section 6.2, the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the Gross-up Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section 6.2), net of the maximum reduction in federal income tax which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
               (B) In the event that the amount of the Total Payments does not exceed 110% of the largest amount that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the "Safe Harbor"), then subsection (A) of this Section 6.2 shall not apply and the noncash Severance Payments shall first be reduced (if necessary, to zero), and the cash Severance Benefits shall thereafter be reduced (if necessary, to zero) so that the amount of the Total Payments is equal to the Safe Harbor; , , that the Executive may elect to have the cash Severance Payments reduced (or eliminated) prior to any reduction of the noncash Severance Payments.
provided
however
               (C) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A)
 
of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. Prior to the payment date set forth in Section 6.3 hereof, the Company shall provide the Executive with its calculation of the amounts referred to in this Section 6.2(C) and such supporting materials as are reasonably necessary for the Executive to evaluate the Company's calculations. If the Executive disputes the Company's calculations (in whole or in part), the reasonable opinion of Tax Counsel with respect to the matter in dispute shall prevail.
               (D) (I) In the event that (1) amounts are paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 6.2(A) hereof, (2) there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax is less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, and (3) after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments are to be reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) hereof, the Executive shall repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the Gross-Up Payment, the amount of the reduction in the Severance Payments, plus interest on the amount of such repayments at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
                         (II) In the event that (1) amounts are paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 6.2(A) hereof, (2) there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax is less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, and (3) after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments are not to be reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) hereof, the Executive shall repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive), to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of federal, state and local income and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
                         (III) Except as otherwise provided in clause (IV) below, in the event there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax exceeds the
 
amount taken into account hereunder in determining the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall pay to the Executive, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the sum of (1) a Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess and in respect of any portion of the Excise Tax with respect to which the Company had not previously made a Gross-Up Payment, including a Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Excise Tax attributable to amounts payable under clauses (2) and (3) of this paragraph (III) (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess and such portion), (2) if Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) hereof but after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments should not have been reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B), the amount by which the Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) hereof, and (3) interest on such amounts at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
                         (IV) In the event that (1) Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) hereof and (2) the aggregate value of Total Payments which are considered "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code is subsequently redetermined in a Final Determination, but such redetermined value still does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor, then, within five (5) business days following such Final Determination, (x) the Company shall pay to the Executive the amount (if any) by which the reduced Severance Payments (after taking the Final Determination into account) exceeds the amount of the reduced Severance Payments actually paid to the Executive, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code, or (y) the Executive shall pay to the Company the amount (if any) by which the reduced Severance Payments actually paid to the Executive exceeds the amount of the reduced Severance Payments (after taking the Final Determination into account), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
          6.3 The payments provided in subsections (A) (C) and (D) of Section 6.1 hereof and in Section 6.2 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of Section 6.2 hereof); , , that if the amounts of such payments, and the limitation on such payments set forth in Section 6.2 hereof, cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Executive or, in the case of payments under Section 6.2 hereof, in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments to which the Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such
provided

payments to the extent the Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall be paid by the Executive to the Company on the fifth (5th) business day after demand by the Company (together with interest at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). At the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).
          6.4 The Company also shall pay to the Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in disputing any issue hereunder relating to the termination of the Executive's employment (provided the Executive shall prevail in such dispute), in seeking to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement (provided the Executive shall obtain or successfully enforce such benefit or right) or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 409A or section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder.

The Executive understands that Confidential Information also includes all information received by the Company or the Subsidiaries under an obligation of confidentiality to a third party. The Executive further understands that Confidential Information that the Executive may acquire or to which the Executive may have access, especially with regard to research and development projects and findings, formulae, designs, formulation, processes, the identity of suppliers, customers and patients, methods of manufacture, and cost and pricing data is of great value to the Company. In consequence of such entrusting and such consideration, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, for a period of two years after the Date of Termination: (i) render services to any Competing Organization in connection with any Competing Product within such geographic limits as the Company and such Competing Organization are, or would be, in actual competition when such rendering of services might potentially involve the disclosure or use of confidential information or trade secrets; or (ii) provide advice as to investment in a Competitive Business (including, without limitation, advice with respect to the purchase, sale, or operation of such business, or advice with respect to financing or other economic structuring of such business). The Executive understands that services described in the preceding sentence, including without limitation those rendered to such Competing Organization in an executive, scientific, administrative, or consulting capacity in connection with Competing Products are in support of actual competition in various geographic areas and thus fall within the prohibition of this Agreement regardless of where such services physically are rendered.
Noncompetition

               (B) The Executive shall not solicit, entice, persuade or induce any individual who is employed by the Company or the Subsidiaries (or was so employed within 90 days prior to the Executive's action) to terminate or refrain from renewing or extending such employment or to become employed by or enter into contractual relations with any other individual or entity other than the Company or the Subsidiaries, and the Executive shall not approach any such employee for any such purpose or authorize or knowingly cooperate with the taking of any such actions by any other individual or entity.
          9.3 . The Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and after his Date of Termination, he shall not make any false, defamatory or disparaging statements about the Company, the Subsidiaries, or the officers or directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries that are reasonably likely to cause material damage to the Company, the Subsidiaries, or the officers or directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries. While the Executive is employed by the Company, and after his Date of Termination, the Company agrees, on behalf of itself and the Subsidiaries, that neither the officers nor the directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries shall make any false, defamatory or disparaging statements about the Executive that are reasonably likely to cause material damage to the Executive.Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph will prevent either the Company or any Executive from (i) responding to incorrect, disparaging or derogatory public statement by the other to the extent necessary to correct or refute such public statement or (ii) making any truthful statement to the extent (x) necessary in connection with any litigation, arbitration or mediation involving this Agreement or (y) required by law, by any court order or by any arbitrator or mediator in a legal proceeding.

Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 
effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as the Executive would be entitled to hereunder if the Executive were to terminate the Executive's employment for Good Reason after a Change in Control, except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.
          10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Executive) if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Executive's estate.

The Executive's right to terminate the Executive's employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness.

               (BB) "Retirement" shall be deemed the reason for the termination by the Executive of the Executive's employment if such employment is terminated in accordance with the Company's retirement policy, including early retirement, generally applicable to its salaried employees.
               (CC) "Severance Payments" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 6.1 hereof.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On January 25, 2007, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER'S FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS COMPANY ACHIEVES RECORD SALES AND EARNINGS IN 2006 AND PROVIDES POSITIVE FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2007 DEERFIELD, Ill., Jan. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter 2006 and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2007. Summary of Fourth Quarter Results Baxter reported income from continuing operations of $433 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 47 percent over the same period last year, and 14 percent on an adjusted basis. Earnings of $0.66 per diluted share exceeded company guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share, and represented an increase of 43 percent on a GAAP basis and 10 percent on an adjusted basis. This performance was a result of strong sales growth, gross margin expansion and lower income tax expense. Worldwide sales totaled $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11 percent compared to the same period last year. Excluding a 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange, sales grew 9 percent and exceeded the company's organic sales growth guidance of 7 to 8 percent. Domestic sales increased 11 percent to $1.2 billion, and international sales also increased 11 percent to $1.5 billion (an increase of 7 percent excluding a 4 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). All of Baxter's businesses posted strong sales growth in the quarter. Sales within Baxter's BioScience business totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 18 percent from the same period last year. This growth was driven by record sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapy products, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID(TM) [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, specialty plasma therapeutics and biosurgery products. Medication Delivery sales increased 7 percent to $1.0 billion, with increased sales of infusion systems, intraveneous solutions and parenteral nutrition products, along with accelerated growth in the company's drug delivery business. Renal sales increased 6 percent to $537 million reflecting accelerating gains in peritoneal dialysis patients globally. "We are quite pleased with our strong fourth quarter results and are very well positioned as we move into 2007," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Of particular importance was our ability to significantly accelerate R&D spending, which is essential to support growth in the coming years." Summary of Full-Year 2006 Results For full-year 2006, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 5 percent to $10.4 billion. Domestic sales totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of 5 percent from last year, while international sales increased 6 percent (with no impact from foreign exchange), to $5.8 billion.
Baxter's reported income from continuing operations totaled $1.4 billion, or $2.13 per diluted share, including special charges of $64 million ($0.10 per diluted share). On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges, the company reported 2006 income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 16 percent over last year. Details of special charges recorded in 2005 and 2006 are outlined in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.2 billion in 2006, and Baxter generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less $526 million of capital expenditures). Baxter's full-year cash flow performance exceeded the company's guidance for 2006 of approximately $2.0 billion in cash flow from operations, and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. "We are very pleased with the quality of our earnings results and the progress we have made financially throughout 2006," said Robert M. Davis, Baxter's chief financial officer and treasurer. "We are particularly encouraged with the strength of our cash flow, which is the best indication of our continued focus on working capital management and value creation." Increasing Investments in Research and Development In 2006, the company accelerated its investment in research and development by 15 percent to $614 million, the highest level of investment in the company's 75-year history. "Rededication to science and technology will be an important driver of Baxter's future growth and success," Parkinson continued. "Over the last two years, our R&D organization has made great progress in applying disciplined prioritization and project management processes that are critical to ensuring increased productivity of our pipeline and higher returns for our shareholders." Examples of specific advancements include: -- Initiated a Phase II clinical trial utilizing adult stem cells to treat chronic myocardial ischemia, a severe form of coronary artery disease. This trial leverages Baxter's proprietary technology to select stem cells for the procedure from the patient's own bloodstream. -- Announced preliminary Phase I/II clinical results of Baxter's candidate H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, suggesting the vaccine is well tolerated in humans and may provide wider cross protection for a larger number of people before and during a pandemic. This represented the first clinical evaluation of a cell-based H5N1 vaccine, and is the first clinical demonstration that a candidate H5N1 vaccine can induce antibodies that neutralize widely divergent strains of H5N1 virus. -- Supported Phase II clinical trials involving the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to treat Alzheimer's disease, which are being conducted by researchers at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. -- Advanced the company's hemophilia portfolio through partnerships with Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen Technologies, leveraging each company's expertise to develop new therapies to reduce the frequency of injections required to treat blood-clotting disorders.
-- Initiated a Phase II clinical trial involving the regeneration of bone using a product co-developed by Baxter and Kuros Biosurgery AG. The product is based on a combination of Baxter's TISSEEL fibrin sealant and Kuros' proprietary biologics and associated binding technology. -- Initiated the development of a recombinant form of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein critical to the normal clotting of blood. Preclinical results, presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, suggest that Baxter's recombinant VWF therapeutic protein has similar properties to plasma-derived VWF. -- Collaborated with Halozyme Therapeutics in the clinical and commercial development of Hylenex, a liquid injectable formulation of recombinant human hyaluronidase that can simplify the delivery of medications and fluids through the use of subcutaneous infusion. First Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Outlook For full-year 2007, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent. This guidance reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business before the end of the first quarter and excludes sales of the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump in the United States, which may resume before the end of 2007. Excluding Transfusion Therapies revenues in both 2006 and 2007, Baxter expects organic sales growth of approximately 7 percent, reflecting a continued acceleration in sales growth compared to 2006. The company expects earnings for full-year 2007 to be $2.47 to $2.53 per diluted share, and to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $2.3 billion.

Note: Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123-R using the modified prospective method. After-tax stock-option expense for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $15 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. In accordance with the modified prospective adoption method, the company did not adjust its historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of stock-option expense. Based on the pro forma application of SFAS No. 123 for the calculation of stock-option expense prior to January 1, 2006 (as previously disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements), pro forma after-tax stock-option expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $15 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

     On March 15, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Baxter International Inc. (the "Company") approved an Equity Plan (the "Equity Plan") pursuant to which employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the named executive officers) are eligible to receive awards of stock options, performance share units and restricted stock units.
     The Equity Plan provides that stock options and restricted stock units awarded to named executive officers will vest ratably over a three-year term and the performance share units will vest three years from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of the performance criteria. The payout resulting from the vesting of the performance share units will be determined based on the Company's Growth in Shareholder Value (GSV) versus the GSV of the healthcare peers included in the Company's comparator group during the three-year performance period commencing with the year in which the performance share units are awarded. Payouts will range from 0% to 200% of the targeted number of performance share units awarded.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On April 19, 2007, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (d) Exhibits. 99.1 Press Release dated April 19, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND BOOSTS FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK FIRST QUARTER SALES INCREASED 11 PERCENT; EPS OF $0.61 INCREASED 42 PERCENT DEERFIELD, Ill., April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported sales and earnings above expectations for the first quarter of 2007, and raised its outlook for the full-year. First quarter net income increased 43 percent to $403 million compared to $282 million in the first quarter of 2006. Earnings per diluted share of $0.61 increased 42 percent over the $0.43 per diluted share reported last year. Strong sales, improved margins, and lower interest expense drove the company's financial performance, which compared favorably to the guidance previously provided for the first quarter of $0.54 to $0.56 per diluted share. Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.7 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 11 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 8 percent over the same period last year, while sales outside of the United States grew 14 percent (or 8 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.5 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Baxter's sales growth of 8 percent exceeded its guidance range of 5 to 6 percent. During the quarter, momentum continued in Baxter's BioScience business, with revenues totaling $1.1 billion, an increase of 22 percent. This increase was driven by strength across all product lines, including recombinant products used in the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapy products for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, and other specialty plasma therapeutics and biosurgery products. The company also posted strong vaccine sales in the quarter as a result of shipments of its candidate H5N1 vaccine for government stockpiles around the world, and strong demand in Europe for its vaccines that prevent tick-borne encephalitis and group C meningococcal meningitis. BioScience results exclude the Transfusion Therapies business, which was divested in the quarter. Medication Delivery revenues increased 8 percent to $990 million as a result of strong international performance and sales of anesthesia products. Renal revenues increased 6 percent to $525 million as the company continued to post strong gains in peritoneal dialysis patients, primarily in developing countries. "Our strong first quarter financial results reflect the building momentum in our business and our disciplined focus on driving margin improvements," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "This performance continues to reflect the value inherent in optimizing our current business portfolio and allowed us to continue to accelerate our investment in research and development, which grew 15% in the quarter." Second Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Outlook Given strong first quarter financial results, Baxter is raising its sales and earnings outlook for full-year 2007. The company now expects to achieve sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share of $2.60 to $2.65, before any special items. In addition, Baxter continues to expect cash flow from operations for full-year 2007 to total approximately $2.3 billion. For the second quarter of 2007, Baxter expects sales growth of 3 to 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share, before any special items, of $0.66 to $0.68.
The financial outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2007 reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business and excludes sales of the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump in the United States, which may resume before the end of 2007. A webcast of Baxter's first quarter conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link on the company's website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CDT on April 19, 2007. Please visit Baxter's website for more information regarding this and future investor events and webcasts, including investor presentations, and the company's Annual Meeting for shareholders to be held in Chicago on May 1. Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, assists healthcare professionals and their patients with the treatment of complex medical conditions, including hemophilia, immune disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma and other conditions. The company applies its expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to make a meaningful difference in patients' lives. This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; future actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the FDA and foreign counterparts, that could limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sales or result in sanctions; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; the ability to enforce company patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-K and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements. Financial schedules are attached to this release and available on the company's website.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Results.
On July 19, 2007, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the companys operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the companys consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings per diluted share and net income, excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the companys reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets.
The press release also uses free cash flow, which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the companys cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the companys cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

DEERFIELD, Ill., July 19, 2007 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported stronger-than-expected financial results for the second quarter of 2007 and raised its full-year 2007 earnings guidance.
 
Baxter reported second quarter net income of $431 million, an increase of 39 percent over the $309 million reported in the second quarter of 2006. Net earnings per diluted share increased 38 percent to $0.65. These results include an after-tax charge of $46 million ($0.07 per diluted share) primarily for costs and asset impairments associated with the consolidation of certain commercial and manufacturing operations outside the United States. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in the current and prior-year periods, Baxter reported net income of $477 million or $0.72 per diluted share, an increase of 28 percent and 26 percent respectively. These results compare favorably to the earnings guidance previously provided for the quarter of $0.66 to $0.68 per diluted share, and were the result of solid revenue gains, strong operational performance led by margin expansion, as well as lower interest and income tax expense.

Baxters worldwide sales totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 7 percent (or 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange). Sales within the United States totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 1 percent over the same period last year, while sales outside of the United States grew 12 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.6 billion. As previously announced, the company completed the divestiture of its Transfusion Therapies business during the first quarter of 2007. Excluding Transfusion Therapies revenues from both years, Baxters worldwide sales increased 10 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $2.8 billion from $2.5 billion recorded in the prior year.   
 
Baxters BioScience business generated a 20 percent increase in revenues, with sales totaling $1.2 billion. This performance was a result of robust growth across multiple products, including
ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method]
, a therapy used in the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapy products for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, and other specialty plasma therapeutics such as FEIBA (an inhibitor therapy indicated for the control of spontaneous bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B) and ARALAST (a human alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) for patients with hereditary emphysema). This business also posted record vaccine sales in the quarter driven by continued demand in Europe for its vaccines that prevent tick-borne encephalitis and group C meningococcal meningitis.
BAXTER RAISES 2007 EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOLLOWING STRONG SECOND QUARTER -- Page Three
 
In the second quarter, Medication Delivery revenues increased 3 percent as a result of strong international performance of anesthesia and parenteral nutrition products, and Renal revenues increased 7 percent to $553 million as the company continued to realize solid gains in the number of peritoneal dialysis patients, primarily in developing countries.
 
We continue to meet or exceed our short-term financial objectives while investing to create long-term value for our shareholders, said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. Our strong financial results in the first half of this year not only validate the
strength of our diversified healthcare model, but also reinforce our confidence in achieving our longer-term objectives
.
 
Baxters investment in research and development increased 21 percent in the quarter, and the company achieved a number of commercial, clinical and regulatory milestones during the period, including:

Six-Month Results
For the first six months of 2007, Baxters net income totaled $834 million and increased 41 percent, with earnings per diluted share increasing 40 percent to $1.26. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxters net income of $880 million increased 34 percent
 
from $655 million last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the six-month period of $1.33 increased 33 percent, from $1.00 per diluted share in the prior year period.
 
Baxters worldwide sales grew 9 percent in the first half of the year to
$5.5 billion, up from $5.1 billion last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, organic sales growth for the first six months of the year was 5 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $2.3 billion, an increase of 4 percent over the same period last year, and international sales grew 13 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $3.2 billion. Excluding revenues related to the Transfusion Therapies business, Baxters worldwide sales increased 12 percent (or 8 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $5.4 billion from $4.8 billion recorded in the prior year.

Cash flow from operations totaled $946 million for the six-month period, compared to $848 million in the same period in 2006. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $258 million for the first six months of 2007) was $688 million, reflecting an improvement of $38 million from the same period last year.
 
Third Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Outlook
 
Given its strong financial results for the first half of the year, Baxter is raising its earnings outlook for full-year 2007. The company now expects to achieve earnings per diluted share of $2.65 to $2.70, compared to its previous range of $2.60 to $2.65, both excluding special items. Baxter continues to expect sales growth of 4 to 5 percent for the year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In addition, Baxter continues to expect cash flow from operations for full-year 2007 to total approximately $2.3 billion.
 
For the third quarter of 2007, Baxter expects sales growth of 3 to 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share, before any special items, of $0.64 to $0.66.
 
The financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2007 reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business and excludes recommercialization of the companys COLLEAGUE infusion pump in the United States, which may occur before the end of 2007.

our focus on gross margin expansion affords us the opportunity to accelerate investments to grow our business for the longer-term, while at the same time, allowing us to meet or exceed our shorter-term objectives.

however
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; , the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under such preceding paragraphs except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such preceding paragraphs. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying person). If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this of any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; ,

It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this to counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to, or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 6
     (b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
CONTRIBUTION
Section 6
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
pro rata
 
claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the Securities Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
     In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the indemnified party may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section.
     The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights and remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity
Section 6
     SECTION 7. . Each Underwriter of the Designated Securities represents and covenants with the Company that (i) without the consent of the Company it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405, other than (a) a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or (b) any free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 that would not be required to be filed with the Commission that is substantially in the form of to the Underwriting Agreement; and (ii) it is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Results.
On January 24, 2008, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2007. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted pre-tax income and adjusted income tax expense, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

          DEERFIELD, Ill., January 24, 2008  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced record sales and earnings for 2007, including strong financial results for the fourth quarter that met or exceeded previously issued guidance.
Summary of Fourth Quarter Results
          For the fourth quarter, Baxter reported net income of $478 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.74, including after-tax special items totaling $10 million (or $0.02 per diluted share) for in-process research and development associated with the company's recently announced collaborations with Nektar Therapeutics and Nycomed. On an adjusted basis, Baxter reported net income of $488 million, an increase of 13 percent over the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.76 increased 15 percent from $0.66 in the prior year period,

TH
QUARTER RESULTS  Page 2
and compared favorably to the earnings guidance the company previously provided of $0.72 to $0.74 per diluted share. Details of the special items recorded are outlined in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release.
          Worldwide sales totaled $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9 percent compared to the same period last year. Excluding a 6 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange, sales grew 3 percent, in line with the company's sales growth guidance of 2 to 3 percent. Sales within the United States increased 3 percent to $1.3 billion, and international sales increased 13 percent (including an 11 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.7 billion. As previously announced, the company completed the divestiture of its Transfusion Therapies business during the first quarter of 2007. Excluding Transfusion Therapies revenues from both 2007 and 2006 for comparison purposes, Baxter's global sales increased 13 percent (or 7 percent excluding foreign exchange) versus the prior year.
          In the fourth quarter, all three of Baxter's businesses posted solid revenue gains. Sales within Baxter's BioScience business totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 16 percent from the same period last year. This growth was driven by double-digit increases across all product categories, including record sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, which exceeded $1.2 billion for the year. In addition, the business generated robust growth in sales of antibody therapy products used for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, specialty plasma therapeutics, biosurgery products and vaccines.
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4
TH
QUARTER RESULTS  Page 3
          Medication Delivery revenues increased 11 percent to $1.2 billion, led by significant growth in Anesthesia as a result of the company's broad product offering and end-user demand for Suprane, the company's proprietary inhaled anesthetic. Revenues in the company's Renal business totaled $601 million and increased 12 percent, reflecting further gains in peritoneal dialysis patients in developed markets, as well as in emerging markets where many people with end-stage renal disease are currently not treated.
          "2007 was a very successful year for our company," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We met or exceeded expectations on all key financial metrics throughout the year. We are also particularly pleased with the improved profile of our earnings, the strength of our overall financial position, and most importantly, the progress we have made in accelerating innovation. We're very well-positioned to continue to meet our commitments, leverage the benefits of our diversified healthcare model, and deliver enhanced value to our various stakeholders in 2008 and beyond."
Summary of Full-Year 2007 Results
          For full-year 2007, Baxter's net income totaled $1.7 billion, or $2.61 per diluted share, including after-tax special items of $119 million or $0.18 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, the company reported net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, an increase of 25 percent over last year. These results compare favorably to the earnings guidance the company
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4
TH
QUARTER RESULTS  Page 4
previously provided of $2.75 to $2.77 per diluted share for full-year 2007. Details of the special items recorded in 2007 and 2006 are outlined in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release.
          Baxter's worldwide sales in 2007 increased 9 percent to $11.3 billion. Excluding a 5 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange, sales grew 4 percent. Sales within the United States of $4.8 billion increased 5 percent and international sales of $6.4 billion increased 11 percent (including a 7 percent benefit from foreign exchange). Excluding revenues related to the Transfusion Therapies business, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 12 percent (or 8 percent excluding foreign exchange) versus the prior year.
          Baxter also generated strong cash flows in 2007, with cash flow from operations improving versus the prior year to $2.3 billion. In addition, Baxter returned more than $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends during the year. The company repurchased 34 million shares of common stock, for approximately $1.9 billion, and paid dividends totaling $704 million in 2007, an increase of $340 million versus the prior year. This significant increase was the result of paying the 2006 annual dividend in January 2007, reinstituting a quarterly schedule for payment of dividends in April, and increasing the annual dividend rate for 2007 by 15 percent.
          "We are very pleased with our financial results for 2007, including our ongoing ability to generate strong cash flows," said Robert M. Davis, chief financial officer. "We were able to return significant value to shareholders as a result of
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4
TH
QUARTER RESULTS  Page 5
progress in rebuilding our financial flexibility, continuing with our capital allocation and financial management discipline, while investing in R&D and accelerating business development activities that will position us for future growth."
Accelerating R&D and Business Development
     In 2007, Baxter accelerated its investment in R&D to a record level of $760 million, representing an increase of 24 percent over the prior year. The company obtained approval or launched more than a dozen new products and therapies during the year, and achieved a number of important business and scientific milestones, including:

QUARTER RESULTS  Page 6
          Baxter also accelerated business development activities in 2007, establishing a dozen new partnerships, collaborations or alliances that will enhance the company's future growth, and completed the sale of its Transfusion Therapies business to an affiliate of TPG Capital L.P.
          "Given our solid and improving financial, commercial and scientific foundation, we are very optimistic about our future prospects, " Parkinson continued. "We look forward to advancing many of the programs in our R&D pipeline and achieving additional product advancements that will help expand access to care, improve treatment for patients, and enhance the quality of life for many."
First Quarter and Full-Year 2008 Outlook
          Looking ahead to full-year 2008, Baxter expects to achieve sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, of 5 to 6 percent. Excluding Transfusion Therapies from both 2007 and 2008, the company expects sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, of approximately 6 to 7 percent. The company also expects earnings per diluted share,
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4
TH
QUARTER RESULTS  Page 7
excluding special items, for full-year 2008 to be $3.10 to $3.18 per diluted share, and anticipates generating cash flow from operations in excess of $2.5 billion.
          For the first quarter 2008, the company expects sales, excluding foreign exchange, to grow approximately 3 percent, and earnings of $0.71 to $0.73 per diluted share, excluding special items. Excluding Transfusion Therapies from both the first quarter of 2007 and 2008, Baxter's sales growth is expected to approximate 5 percent.
          "Our 2008 guidance continues to be aligned with our long-range strategic plans and financial expectations," concluded Davis. "We are committed to meeting our short-term financial expectations, while continuing to invest in innovation and business development activities that position the company for enhanced growth in the future."

     DEERFIELD, Ill., April 17, 2008  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported solid financial results for the first quarter of 2008, and raised its financial outlook for the full year.
     For the first quarter, Baxter reported net income of $429 million, a 6 percent increase compared to $403 million in the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted share of $0.67 increased 10 percent from $0.61 per diluted share reported last year. These results include an after-tax charge of $45 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for additional costs associated with the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump remediation program due to an expected delay in recommercialization in the United States.
     On an adjusted basis, Baxter's net income of $474 million increased 18 percent. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.74 increased 21 percent versus the prior year period and compares favorably to the guidance previously provided of $0.71 to $0.73 per diluted share.
 
BAXTER REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER  Page 2
This performance was the result of improved margins due to enhanced business and product mix, improved pricing, continued manufacturing cost improvements and favorable foreign exchange.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.9 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 8 percent (or 2 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange). Excluding revenues from Transfusion Therapies, a business the company divested in the first quarter of 2007, Baxter's global sales increased 10 percent (or 4 percent excluding foreign exchange) versus the prior year.
     In Baxter's BioScience business, positive momentum continued in the first quarter with revenues totaling $1.2 billion, an increase of 13 percent, reflecting strong double-digit sales growth across all product categories. Driving this performance was robust growth from several products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and immune globulin intravenous (IGIV), as well as solid growth from other plasma-based therapies, biosurgery products and vaccines.
     Medication Delivery sales grew 8 percent in the quarter to $1.1 billion, with strong global sales of intravenous and nutritional therapies, and significant growth in international sales of anesthesia products and injectable drugs. Renal sales increased 6 percent to $558 million.
     Baxter's investment in research and development of $190 million increased 19 percent in the first quarter as the company continues to advance its product pipeline across its business portfolio.

provided
however
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; , the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under such preceding paragraphs except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such preceding paragraphs. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall

It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this to counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to, or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 6
provided
however
Section 6
     (b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
CONTRIBUTION
Section 6
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
pro rata
 
equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the Securities Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
     In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the Company may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section.
     The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights and remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity
Section 6
     SECTION 7. . Each Underwriter of the Designated Securities represents and covenants with the Company that (i) without the consent of the Company it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405, other than (a) a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or (b) any free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 that would not be required to be filed with the Commission that is substantially in the form of to the Underwriting Agreement; and (ii) it is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).

On July 17, 2008, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's operations. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted pre-tax income and adjusted income tax expense each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures facilitate a more useful analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in comparing performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in evaluating management performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., July 17, 2008  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today posted strong financial results for the second quarter of 2008 and raised its full-year financial outlook.
     For the second quarter, Baxter reported net income of $544 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.85, which compared favorably to the company's earnings guidance of $0.81 to $0.83 per diluted share. Net income increased 26 percent compared to $431 million reported in the second quarter of 2007, and earnings per diluted share increased 31 percent from $0.65 per diluted share reported last year. 2007 results include an after-tax restructuring charge of $46 million or $0.07 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income and earnings per diluted share increased 14 percent and 18 percent, respectively, compared to the prior year period.
     The company's strong financial performance can be attributed to continued gross margin expansion as a result of enhanced business, product and geographic mix, favorable pricing across multiple businesses and manufacturing efficiencies.
 
BAXTER REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER  Page 2
     "Our positive financial performance in the first half of 2008 continues to reflect the strength of our diversified business model, and positions us well in this uncertain global economy," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $3.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 13 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange). Positive momentum continued in Baxter's BioScience business in the second quarter, with revenues totaling approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 16 percent. Double-digit growth across the portfolio was the result of robust sales of plasma-based therapies, products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, biosurgery products and strong demand for the company's encephalitis vaccine.
     Medication Delivery sales grew 12 percent in the quarter to approximately $1.2 billion, driven by strong international sales of IV therapy products and injectable drugs, as well as anesthesia products globally. Renal sales increased 8 percent to approximately $600 million as a result of an increase in peritoneal dialysis patients in many markets around the world.
     The company continues to advance its product pipeline across its business portfolio. Investments in research and development in the quarter totaled $222 million, reflecting an increase of 25 percent over the prior-year period.
Six-Month Results
     For the first six months of 2008, Baxter's net income totaled $973 million and increased 17 percent, with earnings per diluted share increasing 21 percent to $1.52. On an adjusted basis, Baxter's net income of $1.0 billion increased 16 percent from $880 million last year.
 
BAXTER REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER  Page 3
Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the six-month period of $1.59 increased 20 percent, from $1.33 per diluted share in the prior year period.
     Baxter's worldwide sales grew 10 percent in the first half of the year to $6.1 billion, an increase from $5.5 billion last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth for the first six months of the year was 3 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $2.4 billion, an increase of 4 percent over the same period last year, and international sales grew 15 percent (or 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $3.6 billion.
Third Quarter and Full-Year 2008 Outlook
     As a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year, Baxter is raising its financial outlook for full-year 2008. The company expects sales growth for the year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 5 to 6 percent, with earnings per diluted share of $3.28 to $3.32, before any special items. This compares to the company's previous earnings guidance of $3.18 to $3.24. In addition, the company expects cash flow from operations of at least $2.6 billion.
     For the third quarter of 2008, Baxter expects sales growth of 6 to 8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share, before any special items, of $0.81 to $0.83.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., October 16, 2008  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) posted strong financial results for the third quarter of 2008, which compared favorably to the guidance previously provided, and raised its full-year 2008 earnings outlook.
     Baxter reported third quarter net income of $472 million, an increase of 19 percent compared to $395 million reported in the third quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted share of $0.74 increased 21 percent from $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year period. The third quarter results include after-tax special charges totaling $91 million (or $0.14 per diluted share) for fixed asset write-offs associated with the discontinuation of the company's CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program, additional remediation costs associated with the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump, and costs for in-process research and development (IPR&D) related to the company's recently announced collaboration with
 
BAXTER'S SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW GROW  Page 2
Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The company recorded after-tax special charges in the third quarter of 2007 totaling $63 million (or $0.09 per diluted share).
     On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges, Baxter reported third quarter net income of $563 million and net earnings per diluted share of $0.88, an increase of 23 percent and 26 percent respectively, which compared favorably to the earnings guidance previously provided of $0.81 to $0.83 per diluted share. Strong financial performance was the result of accelerating sales, continued margin improvement, and a lower tax rate.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $3.2 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 15 percent (or 9 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange), driven by particularly strong performance from the company's international businesses. Renal sales increased 6 percent to approximately $600 million due to the expanded use of peritoneal dialysis in many developed and emerging markets around the world, while Medication Delivery sales of approximately $1.2 billion increased 11 percent as a result of strong international sales.
     Sales in Baxter's BioScience business totaled approximately $1.4 billion, with record growth of 23 percent. Sales accelerated across the portfolio, resulting in double-digit sales increases for all major product categories. This performance can be attributed to robust growth from several products, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (IGIV)], marketed as KIOVIG in the European Union, as well as accelerated
 
BAXTER'S SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW GROW  Page 3
growth from other plasma-based therapies and biosurgery products.
     "In addition to delivering strong sales and earnings for the third quarter, we continue to leverage our diversified healthcare model and capitalize on our broad global presence, while remaining committed to our strategic objective of accelerating the pace of R&D spending," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.
     The company continues to increase investments in R&D, which totaled $230 million and increased 13 percent (or 30 percent excluding the impact of special charges taken for IPR&D in both the current and prior year periods). The company continues to make progress on a number of R&D and new product initiatives, including:

Nine-Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2008, Baxter's net income totaled $1.4 billion and increased 18 percent, with earnings per diluted share increasing 21 percent to $2.26. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items for both 2007 and 2008, Baxter's net income of $1.6 billion increased 18 percent from $1.3 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the nine-month period increased 22 percent to $2.47 from $2.03 per diluted share in the prior year period.
     Baxter's worldwide sales grew 12 percent in the first three quarters of the year to $9.2 billion, an increase from $8.3 billion in the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth for the first nine months of the year was 5 percent.
     Cash flows from operations totaled $1.9 billion for the nine-month period, an improvement of more than $300 million compared to $1.6 billion in the same period in 2007.
     "The medically-necessary nature of our product offering, our diversified portfolio and global presence, and our financial strength and flexibility, provide us with a solid foundation in this uncertain global economy," continued Parkinson. "We remain committed to providing enhanced value to our shareholders through predictable and sustainable operational growth, commensurate with our competencies and long-range strategies."

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On November 11, 2008, the advance notice provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") relating to nominations and matters to be brought before the annual meeting of shareholders were amended.  Sections 2 and 4 of Article I of the amended Bylaws provide that a shareholder who wishes to (1) propose an item of business for the shareholders to consider at the annual meeting of shareholders or (2) nominate a candidate for director must follow certain notice and procedural steps.  Included among these steps is the requirement to provide more complete disclosure from the proposing shareholder, particularly with respect to various ownership techniques employed by such shareholder (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) and clarifying other relationships, including, to the extent known by the proposing shareholder, the identity of other shareholders supporting the proposal or director nomination. The time frame for notice to the Company has also been modified. Notice under the amended Bylaws is required to be given by the shareholder to the Company not more than 120 days, but no less than 90 days, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (rather than the previous standard of not more than 90 but less than 60 days).    
     In addition, Section 4(f) of Article I of the Bylaws was amended to clarify that with respect to the election of directors votes cast with respect to a nominee shall exclude abstentions with respect to such nominee.
     The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Company's Bylaws, as amended and restated on November 11, 2008, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On December 12, 2008, Baxter International Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated the Employment Agreement, dated April 19, 2004, between the Company and Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., the Company's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President (as amended and restated, the "Agreement").
     The primary purposes of the amendment and restatement were to conform the Agreement to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") and to change the term of the Agreement. The changes made as a result of Section 409A of the Code relate to recent regulatory guidance governing the federal income taxation of certain deferred compensation. In addition, the Agreement now provides for a rolling term of two years subject to an expiration date of January 30, 2016. The Agreement also includes changes made to reflect the passage of time and conform terms to existing Company programs and practices, including updating the types of equity awards available to Mr. Parkinson to be consistent with the Company's current compensation program and updating definitions to reflect the definitions now used in Company-wide plans and programs.
     The above summary of the material terms of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
     Date: December 17, 2008
 

Exhibit 10.1
     THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of December 12, 2008 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. (the "Executive") and Baxter International Inc. (the "Company");
     WHEREAS, the parties entered into an Employment Agreement dated as of April 19, 2004 (the "2004 Agreement") pertaining to the employment of the Executive by the Company; and
     WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement to amend and restate the 2004 Agreement;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, the Executive and the Company hereby agree as follows:
     1. . The Executive's employment with the Company shall be subject to the following:
Performance of Services
 
 
(i) The Agreement Term shall begin as of the Effective Date.
(ii) The Agreement Term shall end on the two-year anniversary of the Effective Date; provided that, subject to subparagraph (iii) below, beginning on the Effective Date, the Agreement Term shall, on a daily basis, be automatically extended by one day. As a result of this day-to-day extension, and subject to subparagraph (iii) below, at any time after the Effective Date, the Agreement Term shall be two years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement Term will in no case extend beyond January 30, 2016.
(iii) Either party may, at any time during the Agreement Term, cease the automatic extensions otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) above, by delivery to the other party of written notice of such cessation. Such cessation of extensions will not be effective earlier than the date of delivery of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the end of the Agreement Term shall not be less than two years following the delivery of the written notice of cessation referred to in this subparagraph (iii). No amounts shall be payable under paragraph 4 by reason of the end of the Agreement Term or termination of the Executive's employment on or after January 30, 2016; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the Executive from receiving benefits (salary through date of termination, earned but unpaid bonus amounts as provided in Section 4(a), Pension as provided in Section 2(g), and other benefits in the nature of those provided in Section 4(a)) to the extent otherwise payable commencing following the end of employment.
     2. . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Agreement Term, while the Executive is employed by the Company, the Company shall compensate him for his services as follows:
Compensation
 
 
(i) The monthly amount of the Pension, if paid in the form of a single life annuity, shall be one-twelfth (1/12) of 1.75% of Executive's final average pay multiplied by his number of credited service years, minus (ii) 1.75% of the Executive's estimated primary social security benefit multiplied by his number of actual service years, and further offset as described in subparagraph 2(g)(iv), below.
(ii) Payment of the Pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the Date of Termination (the "effective commencement date"), without actuarial reduction for payment prior to Executive's normal retirement date. If on the effective commencement date the Executive has not yet incurred a separation from service as defined in subparagraph 4(d)(viii)(E), then payments shall still be calculated as of the effective commencement date, but payment shall not actually commence until the first day of the month following the date on which he incurs a separation from service (or if on the date on which he incurs a separation from service he is a "specified employee" as defined in the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Compensation Plan, the first day of the month following the date that is six months after the date on which he incurs a separation from service). Upon commencement of payment, the Executive shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum (without interest) of all payments that would have been paid since the effective commencement date but for the preceding sentence. The provisions of this subparagraph 2(g)(ii) (other than the provision that the benefit shall not be actuarially reduced for payment prior to normal retirement) shall also apply to the payment of the Executive's benefit under the Supplemental Plan (whether or not the Executive is entitled to the Pension), and shall constitute the Executive's election of the Commencement Date of his benefit under Section 4.6(d) of the Supplemental Plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Supplemental Plan, payment of the Executive's Supplemental Plan benefit shall commence in accordance with this subparagraph 2(g)(ii) even if the Executive has not completed 65 Points (as defined in the Supplemental Plan) on the Date of Termination, provided that if the Executive has not completed 65 Points on the Date of Termination and is not eligible for the Pension, the Executive's benefit under the Supplemental Plan shall be calculated using the early retirement reduction factors applicable to a participant whose employment is terminated prior to completing 65 Points.
 
(iii) In lieu of a single life annuity, the Executive may elect to receive the Pension in the form of any other type of life annuity (as defined in the regulations under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, sometimes referred to as the "Code") that is then offered as an optional form of benefit under the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Pension Plan, or any successor thereto (the "Qualified Plan"); provided that the Executive shall elect the same form of life annuity for the Pension that he elects for his benefit under the Supplemental Plan. In such event, the amount of monthly payments shall be adjusted to the equal the actuarial equivalent of the payments described in subparagraph 2(g)(i), using the actuarial factors used in the Qualified Plan. Such election shall be made in writing in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, as applicable.
(iv) The monthly Pension payments shall be offset by the monthly pension payments to Executive under the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan. The amount of the offset shall be calculated as if the Executive had commenced his Qualified Plan benefit on the effective commencement date, and in the same form as the form in which the Pension is paid, regardless of when and in what form the Qualified Plan benefit is paid. If the effective commencement date occurs prior to payment of the Qualified Plan benefit, no adjustment to the Pension shall be made when payment of the Qualified Plan benefit commences.
(v) For purposes of the Pension, the Executive's final average pay is equal to the average of the Executive's five (or his total actual service years, if shorter) highest consecutive calendar years of earnings (Salary and bonus) out of his last ten (or his total actual service years, if shorter) calendar years of earnings, calculated in the same manner as final average pay is calculated under the Qualified Plan (but without regard to any limits on final average pay required by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code).
(vi) For purposes of the Pension, the number of credited service years shall be equal to sum of (i) the number of twelve-month periods commencing April 19, 2004, during which the Executive is employed by the Company (each an "actual service year"), plus (ii) a number of "supplemental service years" determined in accordance with the following schedule:
 
(vii) If the Executive dies prior to the effective commencement date, his surviving spouse or beneficiary shall receive a survivorship benefit payable in a lump sum, as soon as practical, but not more than 90 days after the date of his death, equal to the present value of either
In either case, such benefit shall be based upon the Executive's accrued benefit at age 65 and shall otherwise be calculated in accordance with the Qualified Plan. The Executive's beneficiary shall be the same person as his beneficiary under the Qualified Plan, unless he elects a different beneficiary in writing in accordance with procedures specified by the Company; provided that the amount of the survivorship benefit payable hereunder shall be reduced by the survivorship benefit payable under the Qualified Plan and Supplemental Plan even if paid to a different beneficiary. If the Executive dies after the effective commencement date, the amount of survivorship benefit, if any, payable to his surviving spouse or other beneficiary shall be determined by the form of annuity elected; provided that if the Executive dies after the effective commencement date but during a period during which actual payment of his benefit has been suspended pursuant to Section 409A, payment shall commence on the first day of the month following the date of his death or as soon as practical thereafter according to the form of annuity elected, and the Executive's beneficiary (or estate, if no beneficiary is designated) shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the benefit payments that would have been paid during such period but for the requirements of Section 409A, regardless of whether any survivorship benefits are otherwise payable.
(viii) Except as otherwise provided herein, payment of the Pension shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Supplemental Plan. The Pension shall be considered a Special Supplemental Pension as defined in the Supplemental Plan.
     3. . The Executive's employment with the Company during the Agreement Term may be terminated by the Company or the Executive without any breach of this Agreement only under the circumstances described in paragraphs 3(a) through 3(g):
Termination
 
(i) the willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from the Executive's being Disabled), within a reasonable period of time after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed his duties;
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; or
(iii) the engaging by the Executive in egregious misconduct involving serious moral turpitude to the extent that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company's Board, the Executive's credibility and reputation no longer conform to the standard of the Company's executives.
For purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until the Company delivers to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the entire membership of the Board (not including the Executive) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive).
 
(i) Except as otherwise agreed by the Executive and the Board, (I) the assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent with the Executive's position and status as set forth in paragraph 1, (II) any material reduction in the authority or responsibility of the Executive or other substantial reduction in the terms and conditions of the Executive's employment, (III) a change in the Executive's reporting relationship so that the Executive ceases to report directly to the Board, (IV) the failure of the Executive to be reelected to the Board while employed by the Company, (V) the failure of the Board to nominate the Executive for reelection to the Board and recommend to the Company's stockholders that they vote in favor of the Executive's reelection to the Board, or (VI) the failure to reelect the Executive as Chairman (without the Executive's advance written consent to such failure), with the date of such Good Reason deemed to occur on the failure to reelect the Executive as Chairman
.
(ii) The relocation of the Executive's base office to an office that is more than 50 highway miles further from the Executive's residence than the Executive's base office on the Effective Date.
(iii) The failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform this Agreement.
(iv) Any purported termination of the Executive's employment which is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of paragraph 3(h) below, and for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective.
(v) Except as permitted in paragraph 2(a), a reduction in the Executive's Salary as the same may be increased from time to time.
(vi) A change in the bonus program identified in paragraph 2(b) that disproportionately reduces the Executive's bonus opportunity as compared to other senior officers named in the then-current annual proxy statement.
(vii) Any material breach of this Agreement by the Company not described in paragraphs (i) through (vi) next above.
The Executive's right to terminate his employment pursuant to this paragraph 3(d) shall not be affected by his incapacity due to physical or mental illness.
 
 
     4. . The Executive's right to payment and benefits under this Agreement for periods after his Date of Termination shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph 4:
Rights Upon Termination
(i) The Executive's Salary for the period ending on the Date of Termination.
(ii) Payment for unused vacation days, as determined in accordance with Company policy as in effect from time to time.
(iii) If the Date of Termination occurs after the end of a performance period and prior to the payment of the annual bonus (as described in paragraph 2(b)) for the period, the Executive shall be paid such bonus amount at the regularly scheduled time.
(iv) The Executive and any of his dependents shall be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage (as described in section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) to the extent required by applicable law.
(v) Any other payments or benefits to be provided to the Executive by the Company or a Subsidiary pursuant to any employee benefit plans or arrangements established or adopted by the Company or a Subsidiary (including, without limitation, any rights to indemnification from the Company (or from a third-party insurer for directors and officers liability coverage) with respect to any costs, losses, claims, suits, proceedings, damages or liabilities to which the Executive may become subject which arise out of, are based upon or relate to the Executive's employment by the Company or the Executive's service as an officer or member of the Board of Directors of the Company (or any Subsidiary), to the extent such amounts are due from the Company in accordance with the terms of such plans or arrangements.
(vi) Executive will receive pension benefits upon termination as set forth in section 2(g).
Except as may otherwise be expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Executive to be treated as employed by the Company for purposes of any employee benefit plan or arrangement following the Executive's Date of Termination.
 
(i) The Executive shall receive payment of the annual bonus (as described in paragraph 2(b)) for the performance period in which his Date of Termination occurs, based on actual performance for the entire period, and payable at the same time as it is payable for other participants in the bonus plan; provided, however, that it shall be subject to a pro-rata reduction for the portion of the performance period following the Date of Termination.
(ii) All restricted stock awards shall fully vest immediately and all restrictions shall lapse, all stock options shall fully vest immediately and be exercisable for five years, but in no event later than the date fixed for expiration of the option (determined without regard to Executive's termination of employment), all other performance-based equity incentive and cash-based long-term incentive compensation awards shall immediately vest and become payable at the target level of performance.
(iii) The Executive and his family members shall be entitled to receive the maximum level of medical benefits afforded to senior executives or their beneficiaries upon termination resulting from death or Disability of the senior executive, but not less than 18 months (or 36 months in the case of death) of Company paid coverage, with the period of such medical benefit coverage being counted toward the Company's obligation to provide COBRA medical continuation coverage (as described in section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (if any)). In the event that such coverage extends beyond the period during which the Executive would be eligible for COBRA coverage, the Executive will be required for each month after the maximum period of COBRA coverage to pay the full premium that would be required for a former employee on COBRA coverage, and the Company shall pay to the Executive, on the first day of each month during such period of coverage, additional severance pay in an amount such that the net amount of such severance pay, after all applicable tax withholding, equals the difference between the full COBRA premium and the premium charged to active employees, which amount shall be applied to the payment of the premium for coverage during such month.
 
(iv) If the Executive's Date of Termination occurs under circumstances described in paragraph 3(b) (relating to the Executive's being Permanently Disabled), but not under circumstances described in paragraph 3(a) (relating to Executive's death) he shall be entitled to payment of his Salary through the commencement of long term disability payments to him under any plan provided or paid for by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount that constitutes deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A becomes payable to Executive by reason of termination under circumstances described in paragraph 3(b) (relating to the Executive's being Permanently Disabled), then (A) if such amount is treated as being paid upon the Executive's separation from service (as set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(a)(1)), and if the Executive is a specified employee as defined in subparagraph 2(g)(ii), payment shall be deferred until the first business day that is more than six months after the Date of Termination (or, if sooner, the date upon which the Executive dies), and (B) if such amount would have been payable on a later specified date (such as following the end of a performance period) if Executive's employment had terminated under circumstances described in paragraph 3(e), and such payment is not treated as being paid upon the Executive's separation from service (as set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(a)(1)), payment shall be deferred until the date upon which the payment would otherwise have been made (or, if sooner, the date upon which the Executive dies). Any payments that would have been made during any six-month deferral period shall be paid in a lump sum without interest upon the expiration of such period.
(i) The Executive (or, in the event of death after the commencement of receipt of Severance Payments, his beneficiary) shall receive Severance Payments from the Company for the Severance Period. The annual rate of Severance Payments shall be equal to the Aggregate Annual Compensation, and shall be payable in arrears in monthly or more frequent installments subject to paragraph 4(d)(vi) below. For purposes of this subparagraph (i), the term "Aggregate Annual Compensation" shall mean the sum of (A) and (B) below:
(A) The Executive's annual Salary in effect on the date immediately prior to the Executive's Date of Termination.
(B) The Executive's target annual bonus amount (as described in paragraph 2(b)) for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs.
 
For purposes of paragraphs (A) and (B) above, if any portion of the Executive's Salary or bonus has been reduced to reflect elective deferrals by the Executive, the amounts included in Salary and bonus shall be determined without regard to those deferrals. The "Severance Period" will be the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the earliest to occur of:
(I) the last day of the Agreement Term or the two-year anniversary of the Date of Termination; or
(II) the date, if any, of a material breach by the Executive of the provisions of paragraph 8, paragraph 9, paragraph 10, or paragraph 11.
(ii) The Executive shall receive payment of the annual bonus (as described in paragraph 2(b)) for the performance period in which his Date of Termination occurs, based on actual performance for the entire period, and payable at the same time as it is payable for other participants in the bonus plan; provided, however, that it shall be subject to a pro-rata reduction for the portion of the performance period following the Date of Termination.
(iii) The exercise restrictions with respect to stock options granted to the Executive by the Company shall lapse, and the options shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the Date of Termination. The portion of any stock option granted to the Executive that is exercisable immediately prior to the Date of Termination, as well as the portion of any stock option that becomes exercisable by reason of this subparagraph (iii), shall remain exercisable for the Extended Exercise Period (as defined below), but in no event later than the date fixed for expiration of the option (determined without regard to Executive's termination of employment). The "Extended Exercise Period" shall be the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the later of the date that is five years after the Date of Termination or the date that is the number of days after the Date of Termination that is equal to the number of days that the Executive was employed by the Company between April 26, 2004, and the Date of Termination.
(iv) All restricted stock awards shall fully vest immediately and all restrictions shall lapse.
(v) In the case of a termination under circumstances described in paragraph 3(d) or 3(f), all other performance-based equity incentive compensation awards for the performance period in which the Date of Termination occurs shall remain outstanding and be payable based on actual performance for the entire period and shall be payable at the same time as they are payable for other individuals holding such awards, and in the case of a termination under circumstances described in paragraph 3(g), payment if any shall be made pursuant to the terms of the award applicable following a termination.
(vi) The Executive and his family members shall be entitled to receive the maximum level of medical benefits afforded to senior executives who have retired or terminated employment, but no less than 18 months of Company-paid coverage, with the period of such medical benefit coverage being counted toward the Company's obligation to
 
provide COBRA medical continuation coverage (as described in section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (if any).
In the event that such coverage extends beyond the period during which the Executive would be eligible for COBRA coverage, the Executive will be required for each month after the maximum period of COBRA coverage to pay the full premium that would be required for a former employee on COBRA coverage, and the Company shall pay to the Executive, on the first day of each month during such period of coverage, additional severance pay in an amount such that the net amount of such severance pay, after all applicable tax withholding, equals the difference between the full COBRA premium and the premium charged to active employees, which amount shall be applied to the payment of the premium for coverage during such month.
(vii) In no event, however, shall the Executive be entitled to receive any amounts, rights, or benefits under this paragraph 4(d) unless he executes a release of claims. Such release shall be furnished to the Executive for his review not later than seven business days following the Date of Termination, and shall be executed and returned to the Company in sufficient time so that any period during which the Executive may revoke such release shall expire not later than March 1 of the year following the year that includes the Date of Termination. Any amounts under this paragraph 4(d) that, in the absence of the foregoing release requirement, would have been paid before the revocation period expires shall be paid to the Executive, without interest, as soon as practical after the revocation period expires, but not later than March 15 of the year following the year that includes the Date of Termination.
(viii) In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the following provisions shall apply:
(A) Each Severance Payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A.
(B) If the Executive is terminated prior to a Change in Control, and on or after September 15 of a year, then no Severance Payments shall be payable to him between (i) March 15 of the year following the year that includes the Date of Termination, and (ii) the first business day that is at least six months after the Date of Termination, and all Severance Payments that would otherwise have been paid to him during such period shall be paid in a lump sum at the end of such period, without interest.
(C) If the Executive is terminated following a Change in Control, then no Severance Payments shall be payable to him until the first business day that is at least six months after the Date of Termination, at which time all Severance Payments that would otherwise have been paid to him during such six month period shall be paid in a lump sum, without interest.
(D) If the Executive's employment is terminated under circumstances that entitle him to the receipt of Severance Payments, but such termination does not
 
constitute a separation from service (as defined in subparagraph 4(d)(vi)(E)), then the Executive's right to the receipt of such Severance Payments shall be vested on the Date of Termination, but no Severance Payments shall be payable to him until the first business day that is at least six months after the date on which he incurs a separation from service (or the day on which he incurs a separation from service if on such date he is no longer a "specified employee" as defined in subparagraph 2(g)(ii)), at which time all Severance Payments that would otherwise have been paid to him prior to such date shall be paid in a lump sum, without interest.
(E) For purposes of subparagraphs 2(g)(ii) and 4(d)(vi)(D), whether the Executive has incurred a separation from service will be determined in accordance with Section 409A. By way of illustration, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following principles shall apply.
     (1) The Executive shall not be considered to have separated from service so long as the Executive is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as the Executive retains a right to reemployment with the Company under an applicable statute or by contract.
     (2) Regardless of whether his employment has been formally terminated, the Executive will be considered to have separated from service as of the date it is reasonably anticipated that no further services will be performed by the Executive for the Company, or that the level of bona fide services the Executive will perform after such date will permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of employment if the Executive has been employed for less than 36 months). For purposes of the preceding test, during any paid leave of absence the Executive shall be considered to have been performing services at the level commensurate with the amount of compensation received, and unpaid leaves of absence shall be disregarded.
     (3) For purposes of determining whether the Executive has separated from service, all services provided for the Company, or for any other entity that is part of a controlled group that includes the Company as defined in Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code, shall be taken into account, whether provided as an employee or as a consultant or other independent contractor; provided that the Executive shall not be considered to have not separated from service solely by reason of service as a non-employee director of the Company or any other such entity.
 
     5. . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the period beginning on the date of delivery of a Notice of Termination, and ending on the Date of Termination, the Executive shall continue to perform his duties as set forth in this Agreement, and shall also perform such services for the Company as are necessary and appropriate for an effective transition to the Executive's successor, if any.

     7. . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. The Company shall be entitled to set off against amounts payable to the Executive any amounts owed to the Company by the Executive, but the Company shall not be entitled to set off against the amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement any amounts earned by the Executive in other employment after termination of his employment with the Company, or any amounts which might have been earned by the Executive in other employment had he sought
Mitigation, Alienation, and Set-Off
 
such other employment. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and may not be assigned by the Executive without the written consent of the Company. The interests of the Executive under this Agreement are not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Executive or the Executive's beneficiary. However, to the extent that rights or benefits under this Agreement otherwise survive the Executive's death, the Executive's heirs and estate shall succeed to such rights and benefits pursuant to the Executive's will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided that the Executive shall have the right at any time and from time to time, by notice delivered to the Company, to designate or to change the beneficiary or beneficiaries with respect to such benefits.

Each Item and all Confidential Information (both as defined below) that comes into his possession by reason of the Executive's employment are the property of the Company or the Subsidiaries and shall not be used by the Executive in any way except in the course of his employment by, and for the benefit of the Company or the Subsidiaries. The Executive will not remove any Items from premises owned or leased by the Company or the Subsidiaries except as his duties shall require, and upon termination of his employment, all Items will be turned over to the Company. The Executive will preserve as confidential all Confidential Information that has been or may be obtained by him. The Executive will not, without written authority from the Company, use for his own benefit or purposes, or disclose to others, either during his employment or thereafter, except as required by his employment with the Company, any Confidential Information or any copy or notes made from any Item embodying Confidential Information. The Executive understands that his obligations with respect to Confidential Information shall continue even after termination of his employment with the Company. These restrictions concerning use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information which is or becomes publicly known by lawful means, or comes into his possession from sources not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Company or the Subsidiaries.
Confidential Information
 
     9. . The Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and after his Date of Termination, he shall not make any false, defamatory or disparaging statements about the Company, the Subsidiaries, or the officers or directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries that are reasonably likely to cause material damage to the Company, the Subsidiaries, or the officers or directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries.

Non-Disparagement
     10. . The Executive understands that any entrusting of Confidential Information to him by the Company is done in reliance on a confidential relationship arising out of his employment with the Company. The Executive further understands that Confidential Information that the Executive may acquire or to which the Executive may have access, especially with regard to research and development projects and findings, formulae, designs, formulation, processes, the identity of suppliers, customers and patients, methods of manufacture, and cost and pricing data is of great value to the Company. In consequence of such entrusting and such consideration, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for a period of two years after the Date of Termination: (i) render services to any Competing Organization in connection with any Competing Product within such geographic limits as the Company and such Competing Organization are, or would be, in actual competition when such rendering of services might potentially involve the disclosure or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets; or (ii) provide advice as to investment in a Competitive Business (including, without limitation, advice with respect to the purchase, sale, or operation of such business, or advice with respect to financing or other economic structuring of such business). The Executive understands that services described in the preceding sentence, including without limitation those rendered to such Competing Organization in an executive, scientific, administrative, or consulting capacity in connection with Competing Products are in support of actual competition in various geographic areas and thus fall within the prohibition of this Agreement regardless of where such services physically are rendered.
Noncompetition

The Executive agrees to promptly inform the Company if he becomes aware of any lawsuits involving such claims that may be filed against the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company agrees to provide legal counsel to the Executive in connection with such assistance (to the extent legally permitted), and to reimburse the Executive for all of the Executive's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, including travel expenses. For periods after the Executive's employment with the Company terminates, the Company agrees to provide reasonable compensation to the Executive for such assistance. The Executive also agrees to promptly inform the Company if he is asked to assist in any investigation of the Company or the Subsidiaries (or their actions) that may relate to services performed by the Executive for the Company or the Subsidiaries, regardless of whether a lawsuit has then been filed against the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect to such investigation.
Assistance with Claims
     16. . The Executive acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably injured by a violation of paragraph 8, paragraph 9, paragraph 10, and paragraph 11, and he agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, shall be entitled to a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equivalent relief, restraining the Executive from any actual or threatened breach of paragraph 8, paragraph 9, paragraph 10, or paragraph 11. If a bond is required to be posted in order for the Company to secure an injunction or other equitable remedy, the parties agree that said bond need not be more than a nominal sum. The Company acknowledges that the Executive would be irreparably injured by a violation of paragraph 9, and it agrees that the Executive, in addition to any other remedies available to him for such breach or threatened breach, shall be entitled to a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equivalent relief, restraining the Company from any actual or threatened breach of paragraph 9.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 22, 2009, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2008. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company's operations. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted income tax expense and adjusted R&D expenses, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in evaluating management performance.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., January 22, 2009  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced record sales, earnings and cash flow for 2008, including strong financial results for the fourth quarter that exceeded previously issued guidance. The company also provided its financial outlook for 2009.
Summary of Fourth Quarter Results
     Baxter reported fourth quarter net income of $569 million, an increase of 19 percent from the $478 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted share of $0.91 increased 23 percent from the $0.74 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. These results include an after-tax special charge of approximately $5 million for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of certain technology applicable to the company's BioScience business.

     On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in 2008 and 2007, Baxter's net income in the fourth quarter totaled $574 million, an increase of 18 percent over the $488 million reported for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.91 increased 20 percent from the $0.76 reported last year, and exceeded the company's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Baxter's strong financial performance was the result of continued momentum and strong fundamentals across the portfolio, improved margins, and a lower tax rate.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and increased 4 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased 9 percent and exceeded the company's guidance of approximately 7 percent growth. Sales within the United States increased 6 percent to $1.4 billion, while international sales grew 3 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Baxter's international sales grew 10 percent.
     Medication Delivery sales of $1.2 billion increased 2 percent (or 7 percent excluding foreign exchange) driven by strength in IV therapies, anesthesia products and injectables. Renal sales of $557 million declined by 7 percent (or declined 3 percent excluding foreign exchange). With more than 80 percent of sales outside the U.S., this business was significantly impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, as well as a decline in sales of the company's lower-margin hemodialysis products and a difficult growth comparison created by the loss of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) tender in Mexico in the first quarter of 2008.
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4 QUARTER RESULTS  Page 3
TH
     In Baxter's BioScience business, positive momentum continued in the fourth quarter with revenues totaling $1.4 billion, an increase of 12 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, BioScience sales grew 17 percent, reflecting strong double-digit sales growth across all product categories. Driving this performance was robust growth from several products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (IGIV)], as well as solid growth from other plasma-based therapies, biosurgery products and vaccines.
     "Baxter had another very successful year in 2008," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We exceeded expectations on all key financial metrics throughout the year, which illustrates the solid fundamentals underpinning our portfolio and expanded geographic reach. Despite a challenging, global macro-environment, we're very well-positioned to continue to meet our commitments, leverage the benefits of our diversified healthcare model, and continue with our strategic priority of accelerating investment in research and development."
Full-Year Results
     For full-year 2008, Baxter's net income totaled $2.0 billion and increased 18 percent, with earnings per diluted share increasing 21 percent to $3.16. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items for both 2008 and 2007, Baxter's net income of $2.2 billion increased 18 percent from $1.8 billion in

2007. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 21 percent to $3.38, from $2.79 per diluted share in the prior year.
     Baxter's worldwide sales grew 10 percent in 2008 to $12.3 billion, an increase from $11.3 billion reported last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth for full-year 2008 was 6 percent.
     Baxter also generated strong cash flows in 2008, with cash flow from operations improving by more than $200 million to a record level of $2.5 billion, net of a $240 million contribution to the company's pension funds in the fourth quarter. In addition, the company repurchased 32 million shares of common stock, for approximately $2.0 billion, and paid dividends totaling approximately $550 million.
     "We are very pleased with our financial results for 2008, particularly our ongoing ability to generate strong cash flows," said Robert M. Davis, chief financial officer. "In 2008, we created significant value for shareholders due to the strength of our financial position, ongoing financial flexibility, and continued focus on capital allocation and financial management discipline, while investing at record levels in research and development."
     The company increased its investments in research and development by 14 percent (or 20 percent on an adjusted basis) in 2008, to $868 million. Over the course of the year, Baxter received approval for or launched an array of new products, initiated eight major Phase III clinical trials, advanced numerous early-stage internal programs, and established several new partnerships. 2008 highlights from across all three of Baxter's global businesses include the following:

First Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Outlook
     Baxter also announced today its guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2009. For the full year, Baxter expects sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, to grow approximately 7 percent. Adjusting for the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, Baxter expects reported sales growth to be approximately flat compared to 2008, based on current exchange rates. The company also expects earnings per diluted share of $3.70 to $3.78, before any special items, and expects to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $2.6 billion.
     For the first quarter of 2009, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of approximately 7 percent. Adjusting for the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the company expects reported sales growth to be approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2008, based on current exchange rates. The company also expects earnings per diluted share of $0.80 to $0.82, before any special items.
     "Our 2009 guidance reflects the ongoing operational strength of our businesses and ability to deliver sustainable growth," concluded Davis. "It is aligned with our long-range strategic and financial objectives. Although we are operating in a volatile and challenging macro-environment, the potential effects of which continue to evolve, we remain focused on delivering growth while making appropriate investments for the future."

Section 1
     SECTION 6. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted as such fees and expenses are incurred) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities

are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for the use therein; , , that the foregoing indemnity with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Designated Securities, where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the Time of Sale the Company shall have notified such Underwriter in writing that the Preliminary Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus or, where permitted by law, an issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act), (iii) the Company shall have filed such amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus with the Commission on Form 8-K prior to the Time of Sale correcting such untrue statement or omission of a material fact prior to the Time of Sale, (iv) the Company provided such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus to such Underwriter sufficiently far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, and the Company requested in writing that the Underwriters deliver such amended Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus to the persons to whom the Underwriters are selling the Designated Securities, (v) the Underwriter did not send or give such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale of the Designated Securities to such person, and (vi) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the Underwriter delivered the corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus to such person as provided for in clause (v) above.
provided
however
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; , the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under such preceding paragraphs except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such preceding paragraphs. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall

not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this of any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this to counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to, or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 6
provided
however
Section 6
     (b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
CONTRIBUTION
Section 6
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
pro rata
 
equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the Securities Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
     In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the Company may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section.
     The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights and remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity
Section 6
     SECTION 7. . Each Underwriter of the Designated Securities represents and covenants with the Company that (i) without the consent of the Company it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405, other than (a) a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or (b) any free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 that would not be required to be filed with the Commission that is substantially in the form of to the Underwriting Agreement; and (ii) it is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 16, 2009, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., April 16, 2009  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported first quarter net income of $516 million, an increase of 20 percent from $429 million reported in the first quarter of 2008. Earnings per diluted share of $0.83 increased 24 percent from $0.67 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period, and favorably compares to the guidance the company previously provided of $0.80 to $0.82 per diluted share. This performance was the continued result of strong underlying fundamentals across the portfolio and improved margins, driven by operational leverage and favorable business and product mix.
     On an adjusted basis, excluding 2008 special items, Baxter's first quarter net income increased 9 percent to $516 million from $474 million reported in the prior-year period, and earnings per diluted share increased 12 percent to $0.83 from $0.74 per diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2008.

     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.8 billion in the first quarter and declined 2 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased 6 percent. Sales within the United States increased 5 percent to $1.2 billion, while international sales declined 7 percent to $1.6 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Baxter's international sales grew 7 percent.
     In the first quarter, Medication Delivery sales of $1.0 billion declined 3 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 6 percent). Renal sales of $515 million declined 8 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 1 percent). These results were driven by growth across core components of these portfolios, including the peritoneal dialysis (PD) franchise, anesthesia products, intravenous therapies and global injectables.
     Fundamentals continue to be strong in Baxter's BioScience business. In the first quarter, BioScience revenues totaled $1.3 billion and increased 3 percent. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales advanced 11 percent, reflecting strong double-digit gains across multiple product categories. Key drivers of this performance include notable growth from antibody therapy and plasma-protein products across the globe, continued conversion to ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method], for the treatment of hemophilia, and strong sales of biosurgery products.

"We continue to believe that we are very well-positioned given our broad geographic reach and the medically-necessary nature of our portfolio to expand access to care, improve treatments and enhance the quality of life for patients around the world."
Second Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Outlook
     Baxter also announced today its guidance for the second quarter 2009 and provided updated guidance for the full year.
     For the second quarter of 2009, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 7 percent. Based on current foreign exchange rates, the company expects reported sales (including the impact of foreign exchange) to decline in low single digits when compared to sales in the second quarter of 2008. The company also expects earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.93 to $0.95, before any special items.
     For the full year, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 7 percent. Based on current foreign exchange rates, Baxter expects reported sales growth to be approximately flat. In addition, the company now expects earnings per diluted share of $3.72 to $3.78, before any special items, and continues to expect cash flow from operations to total more than $2.6 billion.

Alternatively, if Employee sues in violation of this covenant not to sue, the Released Party can require Employee to return all but $500 of the money and other benefits paid to Employee pursuant to this Agreement. In that event, the Company shall be excused from making any payments or continuing any benefits otherwise owed to Employee under this Agreement.

          g. understands and agrees that the Company has a protected interest in the goodwill of its confidential and proprietary information and competitive advantage.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 16, 2009, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2009. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., July 16, 2009  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2009 and raised its full-year financial outlook.
     Second quarter net income of $587 million increased 8 percent from the $544 million reported in the second quarter of 2008. Earnings per diluted share of $0.96 increased 13 percent from $0.85 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period, and compares favorably to the guidance the company previously provided of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. This performance was the result of strong underlying fundamentals across the portfolio, improved margins, and benefits derived from the company's ongoing share repurchase program.
     Baxter's worldwide sales of $3.1 billion declined 2 percent in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased

nd
8 percent. Sales within the United States increased 7 percent to $1.3 billion, while international sales declined 8 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Baxter's international sales grew 9 percent.
     In the second quarter, BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 2 percent increase over the prior-year period. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales advanced 13 percent, reflecting strong double-digit gains across several core franchises, which offset weak sales of the company's FSME vaccine, primarily in Germany. Key drivers of this performance include robust growth of antibody therapies and other specialty plasma therapeutics, strong sales of recombinant therapies, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, as well as biosurgery products.
     Medication Delivery sales of $1.1 billion declined by 3 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 8 percent). Renal sales of $550 million declined 8 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 4 percent). Contributing to these results was growth across multiple product categories including products used in peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, intravenous therapies, anesthesia products and injectable drugs.
Six-Month Results
     For the first six months of 2009, Baxter's net income totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 13 percent, with earnings per diluted share of $1.79, an increase of 18 percent compared to $1.52 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding a special item from 2008, Baxter's net income increased 8 percent over the $1.0 billion reported in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the six-month
 
BAXTER REPORTS 2 QUARTER RESULTS  Page 3
nd
period increased 13 percent to $1.79 per diluted share, from $1.59 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
     Baxter's worldwide sales in the first half of the year totaled $5.9 billion, and declined 2 percent, from $6.1 billion in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales growth for the first six months of 2009 was 7 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the same period last year, while international sales declined 7 percent (and excluding the impact of foreign currency increased 8 percent) to $3.4 billion.
     Cash flow from operations totaled $1.0 billion in the first half of 2009, and the company has returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends during the first six months of the year. Baxter repurchased 16 million shares of common stock (or 13 million on a net basis) for approximately $866 million (or $743 million on a net basis), and paid dividends totaling $318 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year.
     "We continue to meet or exceed short-term financial goals, as reflected in the strong sales and earnings performance for the first half of 2009, while investing to create long-term value for shareholders," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "These results and outlook validate the strength of the diversified healthcare model and reinforce our confidence in achieving longer-term objectives as we accelerate the pace of R&D investment."

Third Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Outlook
     Baxter also announced today its guidance for third quarter 2009 and updated its guidance for the full year.
     For the third quarter of 2009, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 7 to 8 percent. Based on current foreign exchange rates, the company expects reported sales including the impact of foreign currency to be approximately flat over the prior-year period. Baxter also expects to achieve earnings per diluted share of $0.95 to $0.97, before any special items, in the third quarter.
     For the full year, Baxter continues to expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to be approximately 7 to 8 percent. Based on current foreign exchange rates, Baxter expects reported sales growth to be approximately flat. In addition, the company now expects earnings per diluted share of $3.76 to $3.80, before any special items, and continues to expect cash flow from operations to total more than $2.6 billion.

On October 15, 2009, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2009. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., October 15, 2009  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported solid financial results for the third quarter of 2009, and provided its fourth quarter and updated full-year 2009 financial outlook.
     Net income grew 12 percent to $530 million from $472 million reported in the third quarter of 2008. Earnings per diluted share of $0.87 advanced 18 percent from $0.74 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. The third quarter results include after-tax special charges totaling $69 million (or $0.11 per diluted share) primarily for fixed asset write-offs related to the discontinuation of the company's SOLOMIX drug delivery system in development, and planned retirement costs associated with the SYNDEO PCA Syringe Pump. The company recorded after-tax special charges in the third quarter of 2008 totaling $91 million (or $0.14 per diluted share).
     On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in both years, Baxter's net income of $599 million increased 6 percent in the third quarter from

$563 million reported in the third quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.98 increased 11 percent from $0.88 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period, and compares favorably with the guidance the company previously provided of $0.95 to $0.97 per diluted share. This financial performance was the result of continued margin expansion, expense leverage and benefits derived from the company's ongoing share repurchase program.
     Baxter's global sales of $3.1 billion were flat compared to the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 6 percent. Sales within the United States increased 5 percent to $1.3 billion in the third quarter, while international sales declined 4 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Baxter's international sales grew 7 percent.
     Medication Delivery sales of $1.2 billion increased 1 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 7 percent). Renal sales of $576 million declined 3 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 4 percent). Contributing to these results was growth across multiple product categories, including products used in peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, intravenous therapies, injectable drugs and anesthesia products.
     BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion in the third quarter, which represents a 2 percent increase over the prior-year period. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales advanced 8 percent, reflecting gains across several core franchises. Key drivers of sales performance include continued growth of recombinant therapies, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor

rd
(Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, antibody therapies and several specialty plasma therapeutics, as well as biosurgery products.
     "We continue to leverage the benefits derived from our diversified healthcare model to achieve solid financial performance, despite a challenging global macro-economic environment," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Given our strong financial position, geographic presence, and the medically-necessary nature of Baxter's products, Baxter is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities across a broad array of therapeutic areas."
Nine-Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2009, Baxter's net income totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of 13 percent. Earnings per diluted share of $2.66 advanced 18 percent over $2.26 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items from both years, Baxter's net income of $1.7 billion increased 8 percent over $1.6 billion reported for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the nine-month period increased 12 percent to $2.77 per diluted share, from $2.47 per diluted share reported in 2008.
     Baxter's global sales in the first nine months of the year totaled $9.1 billion, and declined 1 percent from $9.2 billion reported in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales growth for the first nine months of 2009 was 7 percent. Sales within the United States totaled

its global portfolio that includes intravenous and nutritional therapies, infusion systems, injectable drugs and anesthesia products. Renal sales also grew 12 percent (or 6 percent excluding foreign currency) to $625 million due to the expanded use of peritoneal dialysis in many developed and emerging markets around the world, and the contribution of sales associated with the acquisition of the hemofiltration business, also known as Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT), from Edwards Lifesciences Corporation.
     "In 2009, Baxter achieved record financial results and enhanced shareholder returns," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.

     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, or the Trustee may treat the registered Holder hereof as the owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company, or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 22, 2010, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     On an adjusted basis, excluding the special item, Baxter's net income of $564 million increased 9 percent from $516 million reported in 2009. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.93 increased 12 percent from $0.83 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period and were in-line with the guidance the company previously provided of $0.92 to $0.94 per diluted share.

     Baxter's global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 11 percent from the $2.8 billion reported in the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased 5 percent. Sales within the United States increased 4 percent to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while international sales grew 17 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales grew 5 percent.
     By business, BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion and advanced 9 percent (and excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 3 percent) as a result of continued growth of recombinant therapies, such as ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, biosurgery products and shipments of CELVAPAN, the company's H1N1 pandemic vaccine. This performance was partially offset by an increase in Medicaid rebates required by manufacturers of drugs and biologics under the new U.S. healthcare reform legislation, as well as weaker sales of antibody therapies and certain plasma proteins.
     Renal sales of $584 million grew 13 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 5 percent). Medication Delivery sales of $1.2 billion increased 14 percent (and excluding foreign currency increased 8 percent). Sales results from these two businesses were driven by growth across core components of the portfolios, including the peritoneal dialysis (PD) franchise, the newly acquired continuous renal replacement therapy business, anesthesia products, parenteral nutrition products, intravenous therapies and global injectables.

     Baxter also improved cash flows from operations, generating $279 million, after contributing $300 million to its pension plan in the United States. This represents an improvement of more than $40 million in cash flows from operations from the first quarter of 2009.
     "Despite a challenging global macro-environment and the impact from U.S. healthcare reform, we reported quarterly financial results in-line with our expectations," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "As we look to the future, we believe the diversified and medically-necessary nature of our portfolio, broad geographic reach, and strong new product pipeline provide a foundation for continued leadership in an evolving marketplace, both in the U.S. and abroad."
Recent Highlights
     Baxter continues to advance its pipeline, business development initiatives and commercialization efforts, resulting in a number of recent achievements, including:

Second Quarter and Full-Year 2010 Outlook
     Baxter also announced today its guidance for the second quarter of 2010 and lowered its guidance for the full year.
     Previously, Baxter expected full-year 2010 sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 5 to 7 percent (or 7 to 9 percent including foreign exchange); full-year earnings per diluted share of $4.20 to $4.28, before any special items; and cash flow from operations of approximately $2.9 billion.
     For full-year 2010, Baxter's revised outlook includes sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 1 to 3 percent (or 3 to 5 percent including the benefit of foreign exchange) and earnings, before any special items, of $3.92 to $4.00 per diluted share. This outlook now includes the full-
 
BAXTER REPORTS 1 QUARTER RESULTS  Page 5
st
year impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation enacted in the first quarter. In addition, Baxter now expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately $2.7 billion.
     "Our revised financial guidance primarily reflects the impact of recent healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. and our outlook for continued plasma market pressures," explained Robert M. Davis, chief financial officer. "Despite these factors, we will continue to pursue opportunities to enhance growth through the development of new products and business development initiatives, while maintaining an intense focus on managing costs throughout the company."
     For the second quarter of 2010, the company expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 0 to 2 percent (or 3 to 5 percent including the benefit of foreign exchange), and earnings, before any special items, of $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share.

On May 3, 2010, the Company issued a press release regarding a charge to be taken for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 in connection with the recall of the Company's COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

On April 30, 2010 and pursuant to a Consent Decree entered into on June 29, 2006 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), FDA ordered Baxter Healthcare Corporation, the principal domestic operating subsidiary of Baxter International Inc. (the "Company"), to recall all of its COLLEAGUE infusion pumps currently in use in the United States. As a result, on May 3, 2010, the Company concluded that it will incur in its first quarter results a charge of approximately $400 to $600 million for the cost of the recall, which includes asset impairments of approximately $200 million with the balance primarily being future cash expenditures associated with such recall.
Additional information related to this charge will be disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed in connection with its first quarter results.

          DEERFIELD, Ill, May 3, 2010  Baxter Healthcare Corporation today announced that it will recall COLLEAGUE infusion pumps from the U.S. market pursuant to an order under its existing June 2006 consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baxter will work with the FDA to ensure that the recall process provides customers appropriate alternatives for supporting patients' needs.
          As previously disclosed, Baxter entered into a consent decree with FDA under which the company has been pursuing remediation of the infusion pumps. The decree permits FDA to require the recall of the pumps, and FDA has communicated to the company that it will require such a recall, with the company providing monetary consideration or replacement pumps to customers on a timeline to be determined with FDA and based on medical need. Baxter intends to work with FDA to minimize disruption to healthcare facilities using COLLEAGUE pumps. Baxter anticipates that, among alternatives to be provided to customers, the company will offer to exchange Baxter's Sigma SPECTRUM infusion pumps for COLLEAGUE infusion pumps without charge to customers.
          The consent decree permits Baxter to propose alternative actions to achieve the FDA's objectives under the decree, which the company intends to do. The final nature of the recall and offer to customers remain subject to that ongoing dialogue. Once final, Baxter will notify customers and make information available on www.baxter.com.

Notwithstanding that uncertainty, the company currently anticipates that it will record a pre-tax special charge of $400 to $600 million in the first quarter for the reasonably estimable cost of the recall. The company is not otherwise revising its earnings guidance for the year in connection with the recall.

On July 22, 2010, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2010. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Investor Contacts:
     DEERFIELD, Ill., July 22, 2010  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2010, reporting earnings in line with the company's previously issued guidance of $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share.
     Baxter reported net income of $535 million, which declined 9 percent from $587 million reported in the second quarter of 2009. Earnings per diluted share of $0.90 declined 6 percent from $0.96 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. These results included an after-tax charge of $22 million (or $0.03 per diluted share) for the write-down of certain accounts receivable in anticipation of a settlement with the government of Greece. On an adjusted basis, excluding the special charge, the company reported second quarter net income of $557 million or $0.93 per diluted share.
     Worldwide sales in the second quarter totaled $3.2 billion and increased 2 percent over the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales were comparable to the prior year. Sales within the United States increased 2 percent to $1.4 billion and international sales grew
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 2
2 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales declined 2 percent.
     By business, BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion and declined 4 percent from the same period last year (or declined 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), primarily due to the increase in Medicaid rebates required by manufacturers of drugs and biologics under recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform legislation, as well as lower revenues derived from antibody therapies, vaccines, and international hemophilia tenders. Partially offsetting this decline was continued growth of ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia and ARALAST NP [Alpha 1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)] for the treatment of hereditary emphysema, as well as strong sales of biosurgery products.
     Medication Delivery sales increased 9 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) to $1.2 billion, driven by growth of parenteral nutrition and intravenous therapies, anesthesia products, and sales of the Sigma SPECTRUM infusion pump and certain injectable drugs. Renal sales of $585 million increased 6 percent (or 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), as the company continued to post solid gains in peritoneal dialysis patients, particularly in the United States, Latin America and Asia, and benefited from the recently acquired continuous renal replacement therapy business.
Six-Month Results
     For the first six months of 2010, Baxter reported net income of $472 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 billion or $1.79 per
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 3
diluted share from the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges of $649 million, Baxter's net income for the six-month period increased 2 percent to $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased 4 percent to $1.86 per share.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $6.1 billion for the first half of 2010, including the prior-quarter revenue adjustment of $213 million associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall. On an adjusted basis, Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $6.3 billion, an increase of 7 percent over the prior year (or a 2 percent increase excluding the impact of foreign currency).
     Baxter generated strong cash flow in the first six months of 2010, with cash flows from operations totaling $1.1 billion, after a $300 million contribution to the company's U.S. pension fund in the first quarter. In addition, the company repurchased 23 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion, and paid dividends totaling $348 million, which represents a 12 percent per share increase versus the prior year period.
     "Despite a number of challenges, we were pleased to deliver financial results in line with our guidance," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We remain committed to accelerating earnings growth in the future by leveraging our diversified healthcare model, broad geographic reach, and strong new product pipeline."
Recent Highlights
     Baxter continues to expand its pipeline through investments in research and development as evidenced by a number of recent achievements:
 
BAXTER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 4
     In addition, the company recently announced final details from the FDA order to recall COLLEAGUE infusion pumps in the U.S. market. Baxter will offer replacement Sigma SPECTRUM infusion pumps or refunds to owners of COLLEAGUE pumps and will execute the recall over the next two years to minimize disruption to patient care.
Third Quarter and Full-Year 2010 Outlook
     Baxter also provided financial guidance for the third quarter and confirmed its outlook for the full-year 2010. For the third quarter of 2010, the company expects sales growth of 1 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency, and earnings of $0.96 to $0.99 per diluted share, before any special items.
     For full-year 2010, Baxter's outlook includes sales growth of 1 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the first quarter COLLEAGUE

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 21, 2010, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., October 21, 2010  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2010, and provided its fourth quarter and updated full-year 2010 financial outlook.
     Baxter reported net income in the third quarter of $595 million, which increased 12 percent from $530 million reported in the third quarter of 2009. Earnings per diluted share of $1.01 advanced 16 percent and exceeded the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $0.96 to $0.99 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges taken in the third quarter of 2009, Baxter's net income declined 1 percent compared to the prior-year period and earnings per diluted share increased 3 percent.
     "We are pleased with our financial results in the third quarter which exceeded our guidance," said Robert J. Hombach, chief financial officer. "We effectively executed on our plans to drive operating margin expansion as a result of continued momentum in the Medication Delivery business, improvement in the plasma proteins business, and our disciplined focus on expense management."
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 2
     Worldwide sales in the third quarter totaled $3.2 billion and increased 3 percent over the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales grew 4 percent. Sales within the United States increased 4 percent to $1.4 billion and international sales grew 1 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 4 percent.
     By business, BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which was comparable to the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 3 percent reflecting enhanced sequential growth across the portfolio. Contributing to the improved performance was solid growth of ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States) and specialty plasma-based therapeutics such as FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulation Complex] and ARALAST [Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor], as well as biosurgery products.
     Medication Delivery sales grew 5 percent to $1.2 billion (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), driven primarily by growth of intravenous therapies (including the company's parenteral nutrition products), certain multi-source generic drugs, anesthesia products and sales of the Sigma SPECTRUM infusion pump. Renal sales of $594 million increased 3 percent (and increased 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), as the company continued to post solid gains in peritoneal dialysis patients, particularly in the United States, Latin America and Asia.

Nine-Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2010, Baxter reported net income of $1.1 billion or $1.79 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.6 billion or $2.66 per diluted share from the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in both years, Baxter's net income for the nine-month period was $1.7 billion and increased 1 percent, and earnings per diluted share increased 4 percent to $2.87 per diluted share.
     Baxter's worldwide sales increased 3 percent and totaled $9.3 billion for the first nine months of 2010, including a first-quarter revenue adjustment of $213 million associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall. On an adjusted basis, excluding the COLLEAGUE charge, Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $9.6 billion, an increase of 5 percent over the prior year revenues of $9.1 billion. Sales within the United States (excluding the COLLEAGUE adjustment) increased 4 percent to $4.0 billion for the first nine months, and international sales grew 6 percent to $5.5 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 2 percent on a year-to-date basis.
     Through the first nine months of the year, Baxter generated strong cash flow and has returned significant value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Cash flows from operations through the first nine months of 2010 totaled $2.1 billion (after a $300 million pension contribution to the company's U.S. pension fund in the first quarter), reflecting an 8 percent increase versus the same period last year. In addition, over the last nine months, Baxter has returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends totaling
 
BAXTER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 4
$519 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.3 billion (or 26 million shares).
     "We continue to benefit from the diversified and medically-necessary nature of our portfolio, broad geographic reach and strong financial position, despite continued challenges presented by the evolving global macro-environment," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.

Employee further understands and agrees that the Company is not providing, and does not intend to provide, any legal advice concerning Employee's benefits or continuation thereof.
     4. In exchange for Employee's promises set forth herein and provided Employee has executed this Agreement, has not revoked her acceptance within the time allowed under Paragraph 10d below, and has complied with all other obligations of this Agreement including but not limited to Paragraph 5, the Company agrees:
Company's Promises
:
          a. that Employee shall remain eligible until December 31, 2010, to continue to vest solely in the grant of 19,200 performance share units made to Employee in 2008, pursuant to the Company Equity Plan adopted as of March 5, 2008, including any payout applicable to other participants in the Plan;
          b. that, to recognize her performance and contributions in 2010, Employee shall receive a lump sum bonus in the amount of $285,000 less all appropriate withholdings. Such payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following Employee's execution, and expiry of the revocation period set forth in Paragraph 10d, of this Agreement;
          c. that the Company shall pay, or reimburse to Employee, $1000, less all appropriate withholdings, of the Employee's monthly COBRA costs for the first six months of Employee's COBRA coverage, provided Employee elects COBRA coverage and pays the applicable premium. Such monthly payments or reimbursements in the aggregate shall not exceed $6,000, less all appropriate withholdings;
          d. that Employee shall continue to receive her base pay from October 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010 on regularly scheduled pay dates less all appropriate withholdings;
          e. that Employee shall receive a separation payment of $97,500 per month (which reflects current base salary and target bonus but which shall not affect the Separation Date), less all appropriate withholdings, payable monthly for a period of 18 months commencing January 31, 2011 and continuing through June 30, 2012, for an aggregate payment not to exceed $1,755,000, less all appropriate withholdings, provided that each such monthly payment shall be contingent upon Employee's satisfying Employee's promises and agreements as provided in Paragraph 5 below; and
 
          f. that Employee shall receive $50,000, less all appropriate withholdings, for outplacement. Such payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following Employee's execution, and expiry of the revocation period set forth in Paragraph 10d, of this Agreement.
The parties intend that this Agreement and the benefits provided hereunder be interpreted and construed to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to the extent applicable thereto. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed consistent with this intent, provided that the Company shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden in connection therewith. Although the Company intends to administer this Agreement so that it will comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, to the extent applicable thereto, the Company does not represent or warrant that this Agreement will comply with Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. Neither the Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates, nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be liable to Employee (or any other individual claiming a benefit through Employee) for any tax, interest, or penalties Employee may owe as a result of compensation paid under this Agreement, and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates shall have no obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect Employee from the obligation to pay any taxes pursuant to Code Section 409A. For purposes of the foregoing, Employee's termination of employment on the Separation Date is intended to mean a termination of employment that constitutes a "separation from service" as such term is defined under Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A, each separately identified amount to which Employee is entitled shall be treated as a separate payment, and any installment payments hereunder shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.
     5. : In exchange for the payments and benefits provided in Paragraph 4, which Employee acknowledges are of value and in excess of anything to which she would be entitled under Company policy or practice, Employee (including Employee's heirs, assigns, executors, administrators and anyone claiming for or on Employee's behalf):
Employee's Promises
          a. promises and agrees to release and waive Employee's right to assert, raise, file, or participate as a class member in any claims against the Company or other Released Parties which have arisen up to and including the date of this Agreement. ("Released Parties" means the Company and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and assigns, plus all of its and their executives, officers, directors, attorneys, employees, agents, and employee benefit plans, plus related companies.) This waiver and release includes but is not limited to: (i) any and all claims alleging unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation based on any protected category under federal, state or local laws, including but not limited to any claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended by the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act; (ii) any and all other tort or contract claims whether seeking
 
compensatory, punitive, legal or equitable damages, attorneys' fees and/or costs of any kind, including, but not limited to, claims for wrongful or retaliatory discharge, breach of contract or public policy, defamation, libel, slander, invasion or breach of privacy, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, "whistleblower" retaliation claims, or personal injury; and (iii) any other claim whatsoever up through and including the date Employee signs this Agreement and whether currently known or unknown unless a waiver and release of such claim is expressly prohibited by law (collectively the "Waived and Released Claims"). This means Employee is voluntarily giving up the right to assert, raise, or file any of the Waived and Released Claims against the Company and that the Company shall have an affirmative defense to any such claim, if asserted, raised or filed;
          b. promises and agrees to not accept any money as a result of her filing of any charge against the Company with any federal, state, or administrative agency and to not accept any money as a result of any third party filing of any such charge against the Company;
          c. promises and agrees to "covenant not to sue" the Company (or any other Released Party) for, or based on, any Waived and Released Claim set forth in section "a" of this Paragraph. The covenant not to sue is different from and in addition to the waiver and release set forth in section "a" of this Paragraph. The covenant means Employee is promising not to file a lawsuit in any forum (by way of example, in court or arbitration) concerning any of the Waived and Released Claims. However, this covenant not to sue does not apply to a lawsuit to enforce the terms of this Agreement. This covenant not to sue also does not apply to a lawsuit to challenge the of this Agreement under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended by the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act. If Employee sues in violation of this covenant not to sue, Employee will be liable to the Released Party for its reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs incurred in defending against such a suit. Alternatively, if Employee sues in violation of this Paragraph 5c, the Released Party can require Employee to return all but $2500 of the money and other benefits paid to Employee pursuant to this Agreement. In that event, the Company shall be excused from making any payments or continuing any benefits otherwise owed to Employee under this Agreement. The $2500 shall serve as consideration for enforcement of all provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in effect and enforceable to the extent permitted by law;
validity
          d. promises and agrees to return all Company property (by way of example this includes, but is not limited to, key cards, badges, computers, laptops handheld computer devices, cell phones, credit cards, files, documents, data, disks, flash drives (including IronKey), building/parking passes) on or before Employee's Separation Date;
          e. promises and agrees not to defame, disparage libel or slander the Company, or any of its officers, executives, or directors (the "Non-Disparagement Provision");
 
          f. understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Company has a protected interest in the goodwill of its confidential and proprietary information and competitive advantage. Employee further understands, acknowledges and agrees that given Employee's role as the Company's Corporate Vice President, President  BioScience and her role on the Operations Committee and her access to information known only at the highest level of the Corporation, Employee possesses significant knowledge and information concerning, , the Company's processes, financial, marketing and sales plans, short and long term strategies, key personnel, finances, and research and development and manufacturing for all three business units (BioScience, Medication Delivery, and Renal) and, in particular, the BioScience business, both within the United States and internationally. Accordingly, Employee specifically promises and agrees:
inter alia
 
To ensure compliance with this Non-Competition Provision, the Non-Disclosure Provision, the Non-Disparagement Provision, the Non-Solicitation Provision and the other Employee promises set forth in this Agreement, Employee agrees that from now until June 30, 2012, prior to accepting any offer or rendering any services to any third party engaged in any healthcare business, Employee shall disclose, in writing, the name of that third party and the nature of the offer or services to be rendered to the Company's Chief Executive Officer to ensure that acceptance of such offer or rendering of such services would not violate any such provisions of the Agreement. Employee shall obtain written approval from the Chief Executive Officer prior to accepting such offer or rendering such services. The Company agrees that the Chief Executive Officer shall not unreasonably withhold approval and shall provide such approval in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of Employee's written disclosure, if such approval will not cause Employee to violate this Agreement and if Employee has complied to date with Employee's promises set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Non Competition, Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement Provisions;
          g. promises and agrees to cooperate as reasonably necessary in any litigation, claim, investigation, or subpoena involving or relating to the Company for which Employee may, due to her prior employment as Corporate Vice President, President-BioScience, have knowledge. This shall include Employee being available to meet with the Company's legal representatives and appearing to testify as a witness in administrative or court proceedings or in depositions provided that the Company shall make reasonable efforts to schedule any such meetings or appearances at mutually agreeable times and locations. Employee acknowledges that in the course of her employment, she may have received attorney-client communications and attorney work product and confidential and proprietary information. So that the Company has an adequate opportunity to protect this information, Employee also agrees not to speak to any third-party in connection with any threatened or filed litigation, claim, investigation or subpoena without first getting the express written consent of the Company's General Counsel, unless otherwise required by law. Employee also agrees that she will, within 48 hours of receipt of any such request, pleading, or subpoena, notify the General
 
Counsel of the Company to allow the Company to assert any and all available legal defenses; and
          h. promises and agrees to assist in the transition of her duties and to remain available to answer questions or provide information concerning her past employment or duties as reasonably necessary to effectuate any such transition.
     6. : Employee understands and agrees that the Company is providing the payments and benefits set forth in Paragraph 4 in exchange for Employee's promises, including but not limited to Employee's specific promises to honor and abide by the terms of the Non-Competition, Non-Disparagement, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Disclosure Provisions. If Employee breaches any of these Provisions, Employee shall be required to return all but $2,500 of the payments and benefits already made to Employee pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Agreement and the Company shall be entitled to suspend all future payments due hereunder. Prior to demanding repayment or suspending future payments, the Company shall provide written notice to Employee specifying Employee's breach. The Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This provision does not waive or in any way limit the Company's right to seek other additional appropriate legal or equitable remedies for any breach of this Agreement.
Remedy in Event of Employee Breach
     7.  This Agreement does not in any way: (i) limit or proscribe Employee's non-waivable right to file a charge with the EEOC or to cross-file such a charge with a state agency (or to file a charge with another administrative agency, if, and only if, such proscription is expressly prohibited by law); (ii) require Employee to dismiss any pending charge(s) with the EEOC or cross-filed state agency charge(s) (or to dismiss a charge filed with another agency, if, and only if, such required dismissal is expressly prohibited by law); (iii) limit or proscribe Employee's non-waivable right to participate as a witness or cooperate in any investigation by the EEOC (or to participate or cooperate with another federal or state agency, if, and only if, such proscription is expressly prohibited by law); (iv) apply to any claim arising out of conduct occurring after the date this Agreement is signed; and (v) limit or proscribe Employee's right to file a claim to enforce the terms of this Agreement.
Additional Limitations on Employee's Promises:
     8. Unless expressly stated herein, Employee is not aware of any actions by the Company or any of the Released Parties up through and including the Separation Date that evidence: (i) any inappropriate, discriminatory, harassing, unlawful, unethical, or retaliatory conduct of any kind whatsoever ("Inappropriate Conduct") against Employee or any other third person or entity, or (ii) any failure of the Company to reasonably investigate or respond to any complaint that Employee has made or is aware of about Inappropriate Conduct.

Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 27, 2011, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2010. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., January 27, 2011  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010, and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2011.
     Baxter reported net income in the fourth quarter of $423 million, which declined 26 percent from $572 million reported in the prior-year period. Earnings per diluted share of $0.72 compares to $0.94 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. These results included special after-tax charges totaling $227 million (or $0.39 per diluted share) for costs and asset impairments primarily associated with the company's business optimization initiatives, increased litigation reserves, as well as in-process research and development charges associated with recent transactions. The company also recorded an after-tax special charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $56 million (or $0.09 per diluted share).
     On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in both years, Baxter's net income of $650 million increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter from $628 million
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4th QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 2
in the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 8 percent to $1.11 per diluted share from $1.03 reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. These results were in line with the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.09 to $1.11 per diluted share.
     Worldwide sales in the fourth quarter totaled $3.5 billion and increased 1 percent over the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales advanced 3 percent. Sales within the United States increased by more than 1 percent to $1.4 billion and international sales of $2.1 billion were comparable to the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 3 percent.
     By business, BioScience revenues exceeded $1.5 billion and increased 1 percent from the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 4 percent. Contributing to this performance was strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States), several specialty plasma-based therapeutics, and biosurgery products, resulting in double-digit sales growth across these product categories. This strength was partially offset by the expected decline in recombinant protein and vaccine revenues.
     Medication Delivery sales also increased 1 percent to $1.3 billion (or 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), driven primarily by growth of intravenous therapies (including the company's parenteral nutrition products), injectable drugs and anesthesia products. Renal sales of $626 million were comparable to the prior-year period (and increased 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), as the company continued to post solid gains in

peritoneal dialysis patients, particularly in the United States, Latin America and Asia.
Full-Year 2010 Results
     For the full year, Baxter reported net income of $1.4 billion or $2.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.2 billion or $3.59 per diluted share last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in both years, Baxter's net income in 2010 was $2.4 billion which represents an increase of 2 percent, over the prior-year period, while earnings per diluted share of $3.98 increased 5 percent from $3.80 reported in 2009.
     Baxter's worldwide sales increased 2 percent and totaled $12.8 billion for full-year 2010, including a first-quarter revenue adjustment of $213 million associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall. On an adjusted basis, excluding the COLLEAGUE charge, Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $13.1 billion in 2010, an increase of 4 percent over the prior year revenues of $12.6 billion (and increased 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Sales within the United States (excluding the COLLEAGUE adjustment) increased 3 percent to $5.5 billion in 2010, and international sales grew 5 percent to $7.6 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales rose 3 percent.
     "2010 was an unusually challenging year for our company; however, we continue to benefit from the diversified and medically-necessary nature of our portfolio, broad geographic reach and strong financial position," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We also executed on our key commercial, operational and organizational strategies intended to enhance
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4th QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 4
our effectiveness, competitive position, and growth profile with emphasis on creating sustained value for our shareholders over the long-term."
     In 2010, Baxter delivered record cash flow and returned significant value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.0 billion (including pension contributions of $350 million to the company's U.S. pension fund during the year). Excluding pension contributions from both years, cash flow from operations increased 11 percent versus the prior-year period. In addition, Baxter returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends totaling $688 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion (or 30 million shares).
Fourth Quarter Highlights
     Baxter continued to enhance its portfolio and new product pipeline in 2010 with investments in research and development that reflected funding of all key R&D initiatives, including 14 programs that progressed in Phase III clinical development throughout the year. Recent commercial and pipeline achievements include the following:

Outlook for First Quarter and Full-Year 2011
     Baxter also announced today its outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2011. For full-year 2011, Baxter expects sales growth of 2 to 3 percent, excluding
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4th QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 6
the impact of foreign exchange. This guidance reflects the previously announced divestiture of the generic injectables business, with 2010 annual sales of approximately $200 million, that is anticipated to close during the first quarter 2011. Excluding the proposed divestiture and the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth is expected to be in the 4 to 5 percent range. Also, for the full-year, Baxter expects earnings of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share, before any special items, and cash flows from operations of approximately $2.8 billion.
     For the first quarter of 2011, the company expects sales growth of 2 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency, and earnings of $0.92 to $0.94 per diluted share, before any special items.

DEERFIELD, Ill., April 21, 2011  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced strong financial results for the first quarter of 2011, and raised its outlook for full-year 2011.
     Baxter reported net income in the first quarter of $570 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.98, which exceed the company's previously-issued earnings guidance of $0.92 to $0.94 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2010, Baxter's earnings per diluted share increased 5 percent from $0.93 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Baxter's financial results for the first quarter 2010 included after-tax special items totaling $627 million (or $1.04 per diluted share) related to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump and a change in the tax treatment of post-retirement prescription drug benefits.
     Worldwide sales totaled $3.3 billion and increased 12 percent compared to sales of $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2010, which included a revenue
 
BAXTER REPORTS 1st QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 2
adjustment of $213 million associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. Excluding the COLLEAGUE adjustment, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 5 percent over the prior year.
     Excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the COLLEAGUE adjustment, worldwide sales in the first quarter advanced 5 percent. Sales within the United States increased 10 percent to $1.4 billion, while international sales of $1.9 billion grew 1 percent.
     By business, BioScience revenues totaled $1.4 billion and rose 3 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Contributing to this performance was robust demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States), certain specialty plasma-based therapeutics, and biosurgery products.
     Medical Products sales advanced 20 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion recorded in the prior year that included the COLLEAGUE adjustment referenced earlier. Excluding the adjustment and the impact of foreign currency, Medical Products sales increased 5 percent. This performance is primarily attributable to double-digit growth in the IV Therapies and Global Injectables product categories, driven by strong demand for intravenous (IV) and nutritional therapies, and a broad range of generic and pre-mixed injectable drugs. Medical Products also now includes Renal products.
     "We continue to implement measures to improve our commercial, operational, and scientific effectiveness in response to an evolving and challenging environment," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Baxter's strong financial position provides us the flexibility to

     Baxter's previous guidance for full-year 2011 was sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 2 to 3 percent, earnings per diluted share of $4.15 to $4.25, before any special items, and cash flows from operations of approximately $2.8 billion.
     For the second quarter of 2011, the company expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 4 to 5 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $1.01 to $1.03, before any special items.

The obligation of the Banks to make Eurocurrency Advances and/or EURIBOR Advances, as applicable, in connection with such Notice of Borrowing shall thereupon terminate and each Bank obligated to participate in such Borrowing shall extend a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in lieu of the originally requested Type of Advance, which Base Rate Advance shall be made on the date specified in the original

Exhibit 6.01(d) to Four-Year Credit Agreement dated as of June 17, 2011
To each of the Banks parties
to the Credit Agreement described below, and to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to of the Four-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2011 (the ""), among Baxter International Inc. (the ""), the Banks parties thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Section 6.01(d)
Credit Agreement
Borrower
          I am Associate General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
          In that connection I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have examined:
          (1) The Credit Agreement;
          (2) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower as in effect on the date hereof (the "");
Charter
          (3) The Bylaws of the Borrower, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the ""); and
Bylaws
          (4) Certificates of the Secretaries of State of Delaware, dated ________________, _____, and Illinois, dated __________, _____, each attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in such State.
          I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the Borrower's material agreements as identified on the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and any subsequent filings on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the ""). In addition, I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have examined the originals, or
Material Agreements
 
copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
     1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [and the Notes] are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement [and the Notes] have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
     3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [and the Notes].
     4. The Credit Agreement [and the Notes] are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
     5. Except as disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no pending or, to my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement [or the Notes].
     6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
     (a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the
 
occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith. In addition, a court may refuse to enforce a provision of the Credit Agreement if it deems such provision to violate public policy, including any provision indemnifying a person or entity against liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts.
          (b) The opinions expressed herein are limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, except for the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to the opinions given in paragraphs 1 and 2. I do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. For purposes of the opinion given in paragraph 4 it is assumed, with your permission, that the governing law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I express no opinion as to the effect upon the obligations of the Borrower of (i) any law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York (assuming such law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois) wherein the Agent or any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement may be sought, (ii) the compliance or noncompliance by the Agent or any Bank with any laws or regulations applicable to it because of its legal or regulatory status or the nature of its business, or (iii) any failure of the Agent or any Bank to be authorized to conduct business in any applicable jurisdiction.
          (c) I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement [or the Notes], (ii) or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement [or the Notes] may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.
Sections 5.17
11.05
Sections 5.15(c)
11.04(c)
          For the purposes of this opinion, the term "Applicable Laws" means those laws, rules and regulations that in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement, without having made any special investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation.
          This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without our specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal
 
authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
          The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof and are based solely on factual matters in existence as of the date hereof and laws and regulations in effect on the date hereof. I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion letter should factual matters changes or should such laws or regulations be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise.
Very truly yours,

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 21, 2011, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2011. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

     DEERFIELD, Ill., July 21, 2011  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced strong financial results for the second quarter of 2011, and raised its financial outlook for full-year 2011.
     Baxter reported net income of $615 million in the second quarter, an increase of 15 percent compared to $535 million reported in the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share of $1.07 advanced 19 percent from $0.90 per diluted share in the prior-year period, and exceeded the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.01 to $1.03 per diluted share. This performance reflects double-digit sales growth, operational leverage, favorable foreign exchange and the benefit from the company's ongoing share repurchase program.
     On an adjusted basis, excluding a special item in the second quarter of 2010, Baxter's net income and earnings per diluted share increased 10 percent
 
BAXTER REPORTS 2nd QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 2
and 15 percent, respectively, from $557 million and $0.93 per diluted share recorded in the prior-year period.
     Worldwide sales totaled $3.5 billion and increased 11 percent compared to sales of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased 6 percent. Sales within the United States grew 5 percent to $1.4 billion, while international sales of $2.1 billion accelerated 15 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
     BioScience revenues totaled $1.6 billion, representing a 14 percent increase from $1.4 billion in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, BioScience sales advanced 10 percent boosted by strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States), certain specialty plasma-based therapeutics, and vaccines.
     Medical Products sales increased 8 percent to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion reported last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Medical Products sales increased 3 percent. As previously disclosed, the company completed the divestiture of its U.S. multi-source generic injectables business to Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC during the quarter. Excluding generic injectables sales from both years, Medical Products revenues increased 10 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), reflecting strong growth of anesthesia products, nutritional therapies, infusion systems and other injectable drugs.
     "We remain encouraged with the continued improvement in our financial performance and progress with the initiatives we have implemented to enhance our commercial, operational, and scientific effectiveness," said Robert L.
 
BAXTER REPORTS 2nd QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page 3
Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "These initiatives, combined with Baxter's global presence, diversified portfolio, and focus on innovation, provide unique opportunities for future growth in an evolving and challenging macro-environment."
Six-Month Results
     For the first six months of 2011, Baxter reported net income of $1.2 billion or $2.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $472 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in the first half of 2010, Baxter's net income for the six-month period increased 6 percent from $1.1 billion in the prior year, and earnings per diluted share increased 10 percent from $1.86 per diluted share reported in the first half of last year.
     Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $6.8 billion and increased 11 percent (or 9 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) compared to sales of $6.1 billion in the same period of 2010. Sales in 2010 included a revenue adjustment associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump of $213 million. Excluding this revenue adjustment, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 8 percent over the prior six-month period (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
     During the first six months of this year, Baxter returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. The company paid dividends totaling $358 million and repurchased 21 million shares of Baxter common stock for $1.1 billion.

Outlook for Third Quarter and Full-Year 2011
     Baxter also announced today its guidance for the third quarter of 2011 and raised its financial outlook for the full year.
     For full-year 2011, Baxter now expects earnings, before special items, of $4.27 to $4.32 per diluted share versus previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.28 per diluted share.

In addition, the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately $2.8 billion.
     For the third quarter of 2011, the company expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 3 to 4 percent (or 6 to 7 percent including the benefit of foreign currency) and earnings per diluted share of $1.07 to $1.09, before any special items.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 20, 2011, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2011. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

DEERFIELD, Ill., October 20, 2011  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported third quarter net income of $576 million, an increase of 10 percent from $525 million reported in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per diluted share of $1.01 advanced 13 percent from $0.89 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. Baxter's third quarter financial results included an after-tax special charge of $48 million (or $0.08 per diluted share) for the resolution of long-standing litigation pertaining to average wholesale prices (AWP) and certain historical rebate and discount adjustments. Baxter's third quarter 2010 financial results included an after-tax special item of $70 million (or $0.12 per diluted share) related to the impairment of assets associated with the divestiture of the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business.
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items from both periods, Baxter's third quarter net income of $624 million rose 5 percent from $595 million reported in 2010. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.09 increased 8 percent from
 
 
$1.01 per diluted share reported last year and were in-line with the guidance the company previously provided of $1.07 to $1.09 per diluted share.
Worldwide sales totaled $3.48 billion compared to sales of $3.22 billion in the third quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 8 percent (or 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Adjusting for the divestiture of the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business which was completed in the second quarter 2011, worldwide revenues advanced 10 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Sales within the United States of $1.40 billion grew 1 percent (or 5 percent adjusting for the divestiture). International sales of $2.08 billion advanced 13 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), driven by solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in emerging markets.
BioScience revenues totaled $1.52 billion and rose 9 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), reflecting robust demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States), certain plasma-based therapeutics, and vaccines. Medical Products sales of $1.95 billion increased 7 percent (or 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Adjusting for the divestiture, Medical Products sales increased 10 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), reflecting strong growth of intravenous therapies and injectable drugs, as well as peritoneal dialysis therapy and anesthesia products in international markets.
 
 
Nine-Month Results
For the first nine months of 2011, Baxter reported net income of $1.76 billion or $3.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $997 million or $1.67 per diluted share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter's net income for the nine-month period of $1.81 billion increased 5 percent from the $1.72 billion reported in the prior-year period, and earnings of $3.14 per diluted share increased 9 percent from $2.87 per diluted share reported in the same period last year.
Baxter's worldwide revenues totaled $10.30 billion and increased 10 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) compared to sales of $9.35 billion in the same period of 2010. Excluding the prior-year COLLEAGUE revenue adjustment and the divestiture of the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 9 percent over the prior-year period (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
Through the first nine months of the year, Baxter generated strong cash flows from operations of $1.93 billion and has returned significant value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Through the third quarter 2011, Baxter has returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through dividends totaling $534 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.41 billion (or 26 million shares), a 9 percent increase versus the prior-year period.
"The evolving global macro-environment will exert ongoing pressures on our business, creating challenges that we will manage through disciplined execution of our strategies," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to benefit from the diversified and medically-
 
 
necessary nature of our portfolio, broad geographic reach and strong financial position, and remain committed to innovation through clinical differentiation, enhanced operational and cost effectiveness, improved earnings growth, and delivering sustained value for our shareholders."
Recent Highlights
Baxter continued its commitment to innovation with further investments in research and development and advancements in the new product pipeline, augmented by business development initiatives. The company's research and development expenditures accelerated 15 percent in the third quarter reflecting progress of investigational therapies in late-stage clinical development and success in obtaining approvals and launching innovative products to the global marketplace.

Outlook for Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011

Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), and Synovis Life Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SYNO) today announced a definitive agreement for Baxter to acquire Synovis, a leading provider of biological and mechanical products for soft tissue repair used in a variety of surgical procedures. The acquisition complements and will expand the portfolio of Baxter's regenerative medicine and biosurgery franchise, which includes a number of devices and biological products for hemostasis, tissue sealing and adherence.
Deerfield, Ill., and St. Paul, Minn., December 13, 2011 
The Synovis board of directors has unanimously approved the transaction and is recommending that its shareholders approve the agreement at an offer price of $28 per share, which equates to $325 million of equity value or approximately $260 million after adjusting for the net cash.
Synovis develops, manufactures and markets medical devices used primarily in surgical procedures for soft tissue repair, including PERI-STRIPS DRY, TISSUE-GUARD and VERITAS Collagen Matrix. These products are used in a variety of surgical procedures, including obesity surgery; patching the lining of the brain, vessels, and cardiac defects; hernia repair, and vascular surgery.
The Synovis portfolio also includes products used in microsurgery such as the COUPLER, FLOW COUPLER and GEM MICROCLIP. These products are used for joining small diameter vessels during autologous tissue breast reconstruction; sealing small blood vessels; and head, neck and hand procedures.
BAXTER SIGNS DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE SYNOVIS  Page 2
 
Its newest business area is orthopedic and wound management products, with applications ranging from the repair of rotator cuff and other tendon injuries to advanced wound management. These products are primarily used by reconstructive, orthopedic, sports medicine, podiatric, and vascular surgeons.
"The medical device business that Synovis has built, and its technical capabilities to develop and manufacture surgical products, is highly complementary to Baxter's existing offering of BioSurgery products," said Ludwig Hantson, President of Baxter's BioScience business. "The combined business will offer surgeons in the United States and around the world a more complete line of innovative tools used to treat patients."
"We are enthusiastic about this transaction not only because it is beneficial to our shareholders and employees," said Richard Kramp, President and Chief Executive Officer of Synovis, "but also because the combination of Baxter's and Synovis' product portfolios will greatly expand the combined entity's presence in the exciting and expanding soft tissue repair market, benefiting patients worldwide."
Annual sales for Synovis were approximately $70 million in 2010, and Baxter expects the future top-line growth of this business to be accretive to the company's future sales growth.
Baxter expects this transaction to be dilutive to full-year 2012 earnings by approximately $0.04 per diluted share as a result of acquisition accounting and transaction-related expenses. The transaction is expected to be neutral to 2013 earnings and increasingly accretive thereafter.
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012, subject to approval by Synovis' shareholders, customary closing conditions and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 26, 2012, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2011. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted sales, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

DEERFIELD, Ill., January 26, 2012  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011, and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2012.
Baxter reported net income in the fourth quarter of $463 million, which advanced 9 percent from $423 million reported in the prior-year period. Earnings per diluted share of $0.82 compares to $0.72 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting an increase of 14 percent. The fourth quarter 2011 results included special after-tax charges of approximately $200 million (or $0.35 per diluted share) principally related to costs resulting from a business optimization initiative and certain asset impairments. After-tax special charges in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $227 million (or $0.39 per diluted share).
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in both periods, Baxter's net income of $662 million increased 2 percent in the fourth quarter from $650 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.17 advanced
 
 
5 percent from $1.11 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. These results were in line with the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.15 to $1.18 per diluted share.
Worldwide revenues in the fourth quarter totaled $3.59 billion compared to $3.50 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 3 percent. Adjusting for the divestiture of the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business which was completed in the second quarter of 2011, worldwide revenues advanced 4 percent. Sales within the United States of $1.47 billion grew 2 percent (or 6 percent adjusting for the divestiture) and international sales grew 3 percent to $2.13 billion.
BioScience revenues totaled $1.58 billion and rose 3 percent from the comparable prior-year period. Driving this performance was robust demand for products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] and GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (marketed as KIOVIG outside of the United States), as well as for other specialty plasma-based therapeutics and select biosurgery products.
Medical Products sales exceeded $2.01 billion and increased 3 percent over the prior-year period. Adjusting for the U.S. multi-source generic injectables divestiture, Medical Products sales advanced 6 percent driven primarily by gains in peritoneal dialysis patients, as well as growth in intravenous therapies (including the company's parenteral nutrition products), certain injectable drugs and critical care products.
 
 
Full-Year 2011 Results
For the full year 2011, Baxter reported net income of $2.22 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.42 billion or $2.39 per diluted share in 2010. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in both years, Baxter's net income was $2.47 billion in 2011, which represents an increase of 4 percent over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share of $4.31 rose 8 percent from earnings per diluted share of $3.98 reported in 2010.
Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $13.89 billion for full-year 2011 and increased 8 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Excluding the 2010 COLLEAGUE revenue adjustment and the 2011 divestiture of the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business, Baxter's worldwide sales also rose 8 percent over the prior year (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
Baxter generated strong cash flows from operations in 2011 and returned significant value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Cash flows from operations exceeded $2.81 billion (including a $150 million contribution to the company's U.S. pension plan during the year). In addition, Baxter returned approximately $2.29 billion to shareholders during the year, a 7 percent increase from 2010, through dividends totaling $709 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.58 billion (or approximately 30 million shares). Over the last five years, the company has returned approximately $11.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
"2011 was a very successful year for Baxter as we continue to fulfill our mission of providing innovative life-saving and life-sustaining therapies that
 
 
advance patient care worldwide," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "I'm pleased that despite a challenging, global macro-economic environment, our company delivered strong financial and operational performance, while accelerating investments in innovation, advancing our new product pipeline and pursuing other initiatives to enhance long-term growth, while returning significant value to our shareholders."
Baxter continued its commitment to innovation and enhanced its new product pipeline during 2011 with record-level investments in research and development of $946 million, an increase of 7 percent over the prior-year period (after excluding special items). Also over the last several months, the company has accelerated the pace of business development with a number of business partnerships and acquisitions that complement Baxter's current businesses, broaden its global product portfolio and leverage key scientific, manufacturing and commercial capabilities. Recent achievements include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook for First Quarter, Full-Year 2012
Baxter also announced today its outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2012. For full-year 2012, Baxter expects sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth is expected to be approximately 2 percent. Also, for the full year, Baxter expects earnings of $4.47 to $4.57 per diluted share, before any special items, and cash flows from operations to exceed $3.0 billion.
For the first quarter of 2012, the company expects sales growth of approximately 2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales are expected to be comparable to the level achieved in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, Baxter expects earnings of $0.98 to $1.00 per diluted share, before any special items.
"Our 2012 guidance reflects the ongoing strength of our businesses and ability to deliver sustainable growth despite a number of non-operational headwinds," said Robert J. Hombach, chief financial officer. "Although we are
 
 
operating in a volatile and challenging macro-environment, we remain focused on delivering growth while making appropriate investments for the future."

DEERFIELD, Ill., April 19, 2012  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today posted solid first quarter financial results which exceeded the company's previously issued revenue and earnings per share (EPS) guidance.
For the first quarter, Baxter reported net income of $588 million, an increase of 3 percent compared to $570 million reported in the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share of $1.04 advanced 6 percent from $0.98 per diluted share in the prior-year period. These results included a net after-tax benefit from special items totaling $19 million of income (or $0.03 per diluted share), for costs and adjustments related to recent business development transactions. Specifically, the company recorded special after-tax charges totaling $34 million (or $0.06 per diluted share) related principally to an upfront cash payment to Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta) for the development and commercialization of biosimilar compounds, which were more than offset by a gain of $53 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) resulting from an adjustment to estimated milestone payments associated with the 2011 Prism Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition.
 
 
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter's net income totaled $569 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, which exceeded the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $0.98 to $1.00 per diluted share.
Worldwide sales of $3.4 billion also exceeded the company's guidance and increased 3 percent compared to $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales in the first quarter advanced 4 percent. Sales within the United States increased 3 percent, totaling $1.5 billion, while international sales exceeded $1.9 billion and also increased 3 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
By business, BioScience revenues of $1.5 billion rose 4 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), driven primarily by strong demand in the United States for ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, and GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], used primarily in treating immune deficiencies. Also contributing to this performance was the benefit of the Synovis Life Technologies, Inc. (Synovis) acquisition, which was completed during the quarter, and solid growth in select specialty plasma-based therapies and vaccines.
Medical Products sales of more than $1.9 billion increased 3 percent (with foreign currency having no impact on sales growth). This performance was driven primarily by strong growth in anesthesia products and certain injectable and nutritional therapies.
 
 
Baxter continued to expand its portfolio and pipeline through investments in research and development and pursuit of business development opportunities to augment future growth. Recent highlights include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Baxter has entered 2012 with strong momentum and confidence in our continued success," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Our sustained focus on innovation and growth opportunities enables us to respond effectively to an evolving macroeconomic environment, while strengthening our market leadership and expanding access to care, achieving the highest standards of quality and safety, and creating enhanced value for Baxter, our shareholders, and patients worldwide."
Second Quarter and Full-Year 2012 Outlook
Baxter also announced today its guidance for the second quarter of 2012 and updated its guidance for the full year.
For full-year 2012, Baxter continues to expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 4 to 5 percent (or 2 to 3 percent including the impact of foreign exchange). In addition, the company now expects earnings of $4.49 to $4.57 per diluted share, before any special items, and cash flows from operations to exceed $3.0 billion.
For the second quarter of 2012, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 3 to 4 percent (or 0 to 1 percent including the impact of foreign exchange), and earnings per diluted share of $1.10 to $1.12, before any special items.

DEERFIELD, Ill., July 19, 2012  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced financial results for the second quarter and confirmed its full-year 2012 financial outlook.
Baxter reported net income of $661 million in the second quarter, an increase of 7 percent compared to $615 million reported in the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share of $1.19 advanced 11 percent from $1.07 per diluted share in the prior-year period. These results included a net after-tax benefit from special items totaling $42 million of income (or $0.07 per diluted share), for costs and adjustments related to recent business development transactions and certain financial reserves. Specifically, the company recorded a special after-tax charge totaling $23 million (or $0.04 per diluted share) related to a global collaboration with Chatham Therapeutics, LLC (Chatham) for the development and commercialization of potential treatments for hemophilia B using Chatham's recombinant gene therapy technology. This charge was more than offset by a net after-tax gain of $65 million (or $0.11 per diluted share) resulting

primarily from adjustments to both the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserves and estimated milestone payments associated with the 2010 acquisition of ApaTech Limited, an orthobiologic products company.
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter's second quarter net income of $619 million increased 1 percent from $615 million reported in 2011. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.12 rose 5 percent from $1.07 per diluted share last year, and was within the range of the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.12 per diluted share.
Worldwide sales totaled $3.6 billion and increased 1 percent from year-ago levels. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, worldwide sales increased 4 percent. Sales within the United States advanced 6 percent to $1.5 billion, while international sales of $2.1 billion declined 2 percent. Excluding foreign currency, international sales increased 3 percent.
BioScience revenues of $1.6 billion increased 1 percent from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, BioScience sales rose 4 percent driven primarily by improved demand, particularly in the United States, for ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, and strong growth from select specialty plasma-based therapeutics and the company's portfolio of surgical sealants. Also contributing to this performance was the benefit of the Synovis Life Technologies, Inc. (Synovis) acquisition, which was completed during the first quarter of 2012.
Medical Products sales of $2.0 billion also increased 1 percent from the prior-year period, and excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales rose 4 percent. This performance was driven primarily by solid gains in peritoneal

dialysis patients, growth of certain injectable and nutritional therapies, as well as the impact from the company's acquisition of Baxa Corporation.
Six-Month Results
For the first six months of 2012, Baxter reported net income of $1.2 billion, or $2.24 per diluted share, reflecting a 9 percent increase from last year on a per-share basis. Excluding special items, Baxter's adjusted net income for the six-month period was nearly $1.2 billion and earnings per diluted share of $2.13 increased 4 percent from $2.05 per diluted share reported in the comparable prior-year period.
Baxter's worldwide sales for the six-month period totaled $7.0 billion and increased 2 percent, and excluding foreign currency, sales increased 4 percent. BioScience sales of more than $3.0 billion grew 2 percent (or 5 percent excluding foreign currency), and Medical Products sales of $4.0 billion also increased 2 percent (or 4 percent excluding foreign currency).
During the first half of 2012, Baxter generated strong cash flows from operations of approximately $1.4 billion and returned significant value to shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, Baxter has returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends totaling $374 million and share repurchases of $960 million (or approximately 17 million shares).

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 18, 2012, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.14 rose 5 percent from $1.09 per diluted share last year and was in line with the guidance the company previously provided of $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.

Worldwide sales totaled $3.5 billion, which were comparable to revenues generated in the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Baxter's sales advanced 5 percent. Sales within the United States of $1.5 billion accelerated 8 percent, while international sales of $2.0 billion declined 5 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 2 percent as strength across many countries in Latin America and Asia Pacific offset continued softness in mature European markets.
BioScience revenues of $1.5 billion were similar to sales in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, BioScience revenues rose 5 percent, driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. across all key product categories. This was primarily the result of robust growth in demand for ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method], GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], and other plasma-based therapeutics including FEIBA, an inhibitor bypass therapy, and products to treat hereditary emphysema. In addition, the company benefited from the recent acquisition of Synovis Life Technologies, generating incremental sales in the quarter of approximately $20 million. The strong U.S. performance was partially offset by the impact of tenders in markets outside the U.S., largely related to the timing of purchases for certain plasma-based therapeutics.
Medical Products sales of $2.0 billion were also in line with the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Medical Products revenues increased 4 percent resulting from strong growth of injectable drugs, anesthesia products and nutritional therapies, and the benefit from the company's acquisition of Baxa Corporation, with incremental sales totaling more than $40 million.

"The solid underlying fundamentals of our businesses continue to be supported by the medically-necessary nature of our portfolio and therapies, growing global demand, and our broad global presence," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition, our company's strong financial position provides continued flexibility to invest in innovation, advance our new product pipeline, and pursue new business development opportunities to enhance future growth."
Nine-Month Results
For the first nine months of 2012, Baxter's net income increased 4 percent to $1.83 billion from $1.76 billion last year, while earnings per diluted share advanced 8 percent to $3.29 per diluted share from $3.06 per diluted share reported in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter reported net income for the nine-month period of $1.82 billion, comparable to the prior-year period. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.27 increased 4 percent from $3.14 last year.
Baxter's worldwide revenues totaled $10.4 billion and increased 1 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) compared to sales of $10.3 billion in the same period of 2011. The company's sales within the United States grew 6 percent in the year-to-date period, while international sales declined 2 percent during the period (and increased 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). On a year-to-date basis, sales within the company's BioScience business totaled $4.6 billion, and increased 2 percent (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Medical Products sales grew 1 percent (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) to $5.9 billion.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
DEERFIELD, Ill.  Dec. 4, 2012  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Gambro AB, a privately held dialysis product company based in Lund, Sweden, for total consideration of 26.5 billion SEK (approximately $4.0 billion USD at current exchange rates). Gambro is a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing and supplying dialysis products and therapies for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease. The acquisition gives Baxter a comprehensive dialysis product portfolio, complements Baxter's global home dialysis offerings, and positions the company to better meet the evolving needs of the large and growing dialysis market.
"Baxter has a legacy of innovation in dialysis, including the development of peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease patients in the home. This acquisition further strengthens our global dialysis offerings by extending our portfolio in the hemodialysis segment," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Baxter. "This transaction will provide attractive returns and enhance Baxter's sales and earnings growth over the company's current long-range financial plan."
Gambro is a global provider of dialysis products and technologies used in hemodialysis (HD) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), with annual sales of approximately $1.6 billion in 2011. Its portfolio in the traditional chronic care segment consists of HD devices including advanced monitors, dialyzers, bloodlines, cyclers and dialysis solutions. Gambro's in-center HD devices include the Artis system and the AK 96 system. In the acute care segment, which includes CRRT and treatment for fluid overload, among others, Gambro offers the Prismaflex system used for the treatment of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.
 
BAXTER ENHANCES RENAL PORTFOLIO  Page 2
"Both companies have a longstanding heritage in kidney care with innovative technologies and a dedication to saving, sustaining and improving the lives of patients worldwide," said Guido Oelkers, president and chief executive officer of Gambro. "This acquisition responds to the needs of the nephrology community, healthcare providers and patients seeking a comprehensive dialysis offering of proven products and therapies."
More than two million patients globally are on some form of dialysis, with dialysis treatment rates increasing more than 5 percent annually in part due to the rising rates of diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, healthcare providers are seeking comprehensive dialysis offerings, which vary by region, to serve patients based on clinical need, existing infrastructure and reimbursement policy.
The transaction will provide a number of long-term growth opportunities for Baxter around the world. With a broad and complementary dialysis product portfolio, Baxter can accelerate product sales in established markets such as Europe, where Gambro has an extensive footprint. Baxter can also expand Gambro's reach in high-growth regions of Latin America and Asia-Pacific, where Baxter has steadily grown its peritoneal dialysis (PD) business. In addition, Baxter will also build upon its pipeline of investigational home HD and automated PD systems by adding Gambro's highly innovative and next-generation monitors, dialyzers, devices and dialysis solutions.
Excluding special items, the company expects this transaction to be dilutive to adjusted earnings per diluted share by $0.10 to $0.15 in 2013 and neutral to modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2014. Excluding the impact of special items and estimated amortization of intangible assets, the company expects this transaction to be neutral to adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2013, and accretive in 2014 by $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. The company expects this transaction to be increasingly accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share beyond 2014 and, in addition to an array of commercial synergies, projects opportunities for annual cost synergies totaling approximately $300 million by 2017. Baxter now expects over its five-year long-range financial plan to increase sales (excluding the impact of foreign currency) by 7 to 8 percent and to grow adjusted earnings per diluted share in the 8 to 10 percent range, both on a compounded annual basis.

The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash generated from overseas operations and debt. Baxter expects to maintain its current dividend payout ratio of approximately 40 percent. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur in the first half of 2013.
J.P. Morgan acted as financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to Baxter.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 24, 2013, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2012. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
99.1    Press Release dated January 24, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

DEERFIELD, Ill., January 24, 2013  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012, and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2013.
Baxter reported net income in the fourth quarter of $494 million, which compares to $463 million reported in the prior-year period. Earnings per diluted share of $0.89 compares to $0.82 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase of 9 percent. The fourth quarter 2012 results included special after-tax items of $206 million (or $0.37 per diluted share) primarily related to costs associated with settlement of certain U.S. pension obligations and business optimization initiatives. After-tax special items in the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled approximately $200 million (or $0.35 per diluted share).
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in both periods, Baxter's net income of $700 million increased 6 percent in the fourth quarter from $662 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.26 advanced
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4th QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page  2
 
8 percent from $1.17 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2011. These results were in line with the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.24 to $1.27 per diluted share.
Worldwide revenues grew 4 percent in the fourth quarter to $3.8 billion compared to $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5 percent. Sales within the United States of $1.6 billion advanced 7 percent, and international sales increased 2 percent to $2.2 billion (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
BioScience revenues totaled $1.7 billion and rose 7 percent (or 9 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) from the same period last year. Driving this performance was robust growth in demand, particularly in the United States, for ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method], and GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], as well as other plasma-based therapeutics including FEIBA, an inhibitor bypass therapy, and albumin. In addition, the company benefited from milestone payments related to the company's ongoing collaborations with governments on the development of influenza vaccines, and the acquisition of Synovis Life Technologies.
Medical Products sales totaled $2.1 billion and increased 2 percent over the prior-year period (or 3 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency), driven primarily by gains in peritoneal dialysis patients in the U.S., as well as growth in intravenous therapies (including the company's parenteral nutrition products), certain injectable drugs including oncolytics and critical care products, and a benefit from the company's acquisition of Baxa Corporation.

Full-Year 2012 Results
For the full year 2012, Baxter reported net income of $2.3 billion or $4.18 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.2 billion or $3.88 per diluted share in 2011. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in both years, Baxter's net income was $2.5 billion in 2012, which represents an increase of 2 percent over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share of $4.53 rose 5 percent from earnings per diluted share of $4.31 reported in 2011.
Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $14.2 billion for full-year 2012 and increased 2 percent versus the prior-year period (or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). Sales within the United States of $6.1 billion advanced 6 percent in 2012, and international sales declined 1 percent to $8.1 billion (but increased 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency). BioScience sales improved 3 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) to $6.2 billion, while Medical Products sales increased 1 percent to $8.0 billion (or 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency).
Baxter generated strong cash flows from operations in 2012 and returned significant value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Cash flows from operations rose 10 percent and totaled more than $3.1 billion in 2012, a record level. Baxter returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders during the year, through dividends totaling $800 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion (or approximately 25 million shares).
At the same time, Baxter increased its investments in research and development to $1.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 22 percent, as the company advanced a number of clinical programs in its pipeline, expanded its portfolio with
 
BAXTER REPORTS 4th QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  Page  4
 
several product launches and line extensions, and initiated several new programs and collaborations. In addition, Baxter announced investments to enhance future plasma production capacity with a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Georgia and a collaboration with Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening (Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation) in the Netherlands to support growth of its plasma-based treatments. The company also entered into a number of partnerships, such as a novel public-private partnership in Brazil to expand patient access to vital hemophilia therapies, and executed several business development initiatives to enhance future growth, including the proposed acquisition of Gambro AB, a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing and supplying dialysis products and therapies for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease.
"The progress we have made during 2012, together with our solid financial performance, sets a very strong foundation for 2013 and beyond. We remain very confident in the long-term growth prospects for our company," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Baxter's core portfolio continues to benefit from our focus on life-saving therapies, and the increased level of R&D investment has transformed our new product pipeline into a robust portfolio of products and therapies directed at improving the quality of care while addressing key, high-potential areas of unmet medical need. We've also entered into a number of partnerships and executed business development initiatives that align with our core strengths, position Baxter for future success, and enhance shareholder value."

Outlook for First Quarter, Full-Year 2013
Baxter also announced today its outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2013. The company's full-year guidance includes the impact of the Gambro AB acquisition, which is projected to close at the end of the second quarter and dilute full-year 2013 earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. Including Gambro, Baxter's guidance reflects sales growth for the full-year 2013 of approximately 10 percent, before the impact of foreign exchange. Also, for the full year, Baxter expects earnings of $4.60 to $4.70 per diluted share, before any special items, and cash flows from operations of approximately $3.3 billion.
For the first quarter of 2013, the company expects sales growth of approximately 2 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Baxter expects earnings of $1.03 to $1.05 per diluted share in the first quarter, before any special items.

In the case of an outstanding Notice of Interest Rate Election requesting that Loans be Converted into, or continued as, Eurodollar Loans at the time any such suspension shall occur, such Notice shall be deemed amended, without any further action on the part of the Borrower, to request that the Loans specified therein be Converted to ABR Loans at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section 4.01(d)
Credit Agreement
Borrower
I am Associate General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
In that connection I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have examined:
(1) The Credit Agreement;
(2) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower as in effect on the date hereof (the "");
Charter
(3) The Bylaws of the Borrower, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the ""); and
Bylaws
(4) Certificates of the Secretaries of State of Delaware, dated                     ,                     , and Illinois, dated                    ,                 , each attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in such State.
I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the Borrower's material agreements as identified on the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and any subsequent filings on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the ""). In addition, I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates
Material Agreements
 
of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a Share Purchase Agreement Material Adverse Effect.
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement.
4. The Credit Agreement are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
5. Except as disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no pending or, to my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a Share Purchase Agreement Material Adverse Effect or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement.
6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
(a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith. In addition, a court may refuse to enforce a provision of the Credit Agreement if it deems such provision to violate public policy, including any provision indemnifying a person or entity against liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts.
 
(b) The opinions expressed herein are limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, except for the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to the opinions given in paragraphs 1 and 2. I do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. For purposes of the opinion given in paragraph 4 it is assumed, with your permission, that the governing law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I express no opinion as to the effect upon the obligations of the Borrower of (i) any law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York (assuming such law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois) wherein the Agent or any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement may be sought, (ii) the compliance or noncompliance by the Agent or any Bank with any laws or regulations applicable to it because of its legal or regulatory status or the nature of its business, or (iii) any failure of the Agent or any Bank to be authorized to conduct business in any applicable jurisdiction.
(c) I express no opinion as to (i)  and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement, (ii)  or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 18, 2013, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2013. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted pre-tax income, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period.
Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
99.1    Press Release dated April 18, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

DEERFIELD, Ill., April 18, 2013  Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported first quarter financial results in line with the company's previously issued guidance and confirmed its full-year 2013 financial outlook.
For the first quarter, Baxter reported net income of $552 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.00, compared to net income of $588 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.04 in the same period last year. First quarter 2013 results include after-tax special items totaling $29 million (or $0.05 per diluted share) primarily for deal-related costs associated with Baxter's planned acquisition of Gambro AB, a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing and supplying dialysis products and therapies for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease. First quarter 2012 results included a net after-tax benefit from special items totaling $19 million of income (or $0.03 per diluted share) for payments and adjustments pertaining to business development transactions.
On an adjusted basis, excluding special items in both periods, Baxter's first quarter net income of $581 million increased 2 percent from $569 million reported in 2012. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.05 rose 4 percent from $1.01 per diluted share last year, in line with the company's previously issued earnings guidance of $1.03 to $1.05 per diluted share.

Worldwide sales of $3.45 billion increased 2 percent compared to $3.39 billion reported in the first quarter of 2012. Sales within the United States increased 1 percent, totaling $1.48 billion, while international sales of $1.97 billion increased 2 percent. The impact of foreign currency on sales growth in the quarter was immaterial.
By business, BioScience revenues of $1.53 billion rose 5 percent, driven primarily by strong demand for ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] for the treatment of hemophilia, as well as certain plasma-based therapeutics and vaccines. Medical Products sales of $1.92 billion were comparable to the prior-year period as growth for intravenous therapies was more than offset by lower sales in the company's pharma-partnering business.
Baxter continued to make investments to support geographic expansion initiatives and new product introductions, and continued to advance a number of programs that improve the quality of care and address key, high-potential areas of unmet medical need. Recent achievements include:

Second Quarter and Full-Year 2013 Outlook
Baxter also announced today its guidance for the second quarter of 2013 and confirmed its guidance for the full year.
For the second quarter of 2013, Baxter expects sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 4 percent and earnings per diluted share of $1.12 to $1.14, before any special items.
For full-year 2013, Baxter continues to expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of approximately 10 percent. In addition, the company expects earnings of $4.60 to $4.70 per diluted share, before any special items, and cash flows from operations of approximately $3.3 billion. The company's full-year guidance includes the impact of the Gambro AB acquisition, which is projected to be dilutive to full-year 2013 earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share.

At the annual meeting of shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (the "Company") on May 7, 2013 (the "Annual Meeting"), changes to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") were approved by shareholders. The changes became effective on May 9, 2013, when the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Charter was then restated to reflect the Amendment and was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 9, 2013. A new Article TWELFTH was added to the Charter to grant holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of common stock the right to call a special meeting of shareholders. The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the restated Charter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Upon the filing of the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 9, 2013, amendments to the Company's Bylaws ("Bylaws") also became effective. These amendments had been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval of the amendment to add Article TWELFTH to the Charter at the Annual Meeting. Section 3 of Article I of the Bylaws was amended to include procedural requirements for shareholders seeking to call a special meeting, including advance notice provisions and information requirements; to specify business that may be transacted at a special meeting; to provide guidelines on scheduling of proposed special meeting dates; and to include technical provisions addressing multiple meeting requests and revocation of requests. The advance notice provisions of Sections 2 and 4 of Article I of the Bylaws were amended to align with the changes made to similar provisions in Section 3. Section 4 of Article I was also amended to clarify that the provisions of Section 4 of Article I are the exclusive means for shareholders to nominate directors before an annual or special meeting. The foregoing description of the amendments to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Bylaws, as amended and restated on May 9, 2013, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
As referenced at the Annual Meeting, Sebastian J. Bufalino, age 52, was elected to serve as the Company's principal accounting officer with the title of Corporate Vice President and Controller, replacing Michael J.

RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of this Corporation by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the designations, powers, preferences and relative and other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as follows:
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.
The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 3,500,000.
 
SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of January, April, July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $5.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all noncash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $1 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after November 17, 1998 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior to and superior to the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, a dividend of $5.00 per share on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payments thereof.
 
SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS.
The holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holder of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote collectively as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) If at any time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors a default in preference dividends on the Preferred Stock shall exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Preferred Stock of all series shall have the right at such meeting, voting together as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships. Such right shall continue until there are no dividends in arrears upon the Preferred Stock. Each director elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (herein called a "Preferred Director"), shall continue to serve as such director for the full term for which he shall have been elected, notwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default in preference dividends shall cease to exist. Any Preferred Director may be removed by, and shall not be removed except by, the vote of holders of record of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at a meeting of the stockholders, or of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, called for the purpose. So long as a default in any preference dividends on the Preferred Stock shall exist (A) any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director may be filled (except as provided in the following clause (B)) by an instrument in writing signed by the remaining Preferred Director and filed with the Corporation and (B) in the case of the removal of any Preferred Director, the vacancy may be filled by the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at the same meeting at which such removal shall be voted. Each director appointed as aforesaid by the remaining Preferred Director shall be deemed, for all purposes hereof, to be a Preferred Director. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Directors shall end and a default in preference dividends shall no longer exist, the number of directors, constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be reduced by two. For the purposes hereof, a "default in preference dividends" on the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of accrued dividends upon any series of the Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six full quarter yearly dividends or more, and, having so occurred, such default shall be deemed to exist thereafter until, but only until, all accrued dividends on all shares of Preferred Stock of each and every series then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the end of the last preceding quarterly dividend period.
 
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or distributions payable on the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
 
 
 
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES.
Any shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.
(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series B Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series B Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.
(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.
In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which
 
each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION.
The shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
SECTION 9. RANKING.
The Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets whether or not upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
SECTION 10. AMENDMENT.
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
SECTION 11. FRACTIONAL SHARES.
Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be the number from time to time fixed by the Board of Directors but in no event shall be less than nine or more than seventeen. A decrease in the number of directors shall not affect the term of office of any director then in office.
FIFTH:

The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes. The term of office for one class of directors will expire each year at the annual meeting of stockholders, or thereafter in each case until the directors' respective successors are elected and qualified. The directors chosen to succeed those whose terms are expiring shall be identified as being of the same class as the directors whom they succeed and shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders or thereafter in each case until their respective successors are elected and qualified, subject to death, resignation, retirement or removal from office.
SIXTH:
 
Any new positions created as a result of the increase in the number of directors shall be allocated to make the classes of directors as nearly equal as possible. Any director elected to fill a term resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same term as the other members of his class. A director elected to fill any other vacancy shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the certificate of incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article unless expressly provided by such terms.
SIXTH
This Article may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the holders of all the securities of the Corporation then entitled to vote on such change.

EIGHTH:
The Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to each person who serves as an officer or director of the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation and each person who serves or may have served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise from any liability incurred as a result of such service to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as it may from time to time be amended, except with respect to an action commenced by such director or officer against the Corporation or by such director or officer as a derivative action by or in the right of the Corporation. Each person who is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation and each officer or director who commences any action against the Corporation or a derivative action by or in the right of the Corporation may be similarly indemnified and receive an advance of expenses at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
NINTH:
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Delaware law.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
No amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or repeal of any Article of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall increase the liability or alleged liability or reduce or limit the right to indemnification of any directors, officers or employees of the Corporation for acts or omissions of such person occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
TENTH:
No action which requires the vote or consent of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting and vote of stockholders and the power of stockholders to consent in writing without a meeting to the taking of any action is specifically denied.
ELEVENTH:

For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to such nominee. Votes cast with respect to a nominee shall exclude abstentions with respect to such nominee.
