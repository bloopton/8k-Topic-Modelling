Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)June 10, 2002The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has notified Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) that it has concluded its informal inquiry regarding Amazon.com's accounting treatment and disclosures for some of its strategic alliances, and that no enforcement proceeding will be recommended in connection with that inquiry. The informal inquiry, first disclosed by Amazon.com in October 2000, related to the revenue recognition, equity investments, and other accounting and disclosure matters pertaining to Amazon.com's commercial and stock purchase agreements with its partners in the Amazon Commerce Network.
 
Separately, Amazon.com has reached a settlement with the SEC regarding an accounting investigation involving Ashford.com's allegedly improper accounting for the resolution of a business dispute between Ashford.com and Amazon.com in March 2000. (Ashford.com was acquired by Global Sports Inc in 2001 (NASDAQ: GSIC).) The settlement is described in SEC Litigation Release #17550, dated June 10, 2002. The administrative cease-and-desist order settling the matter relates solely to the accounting, disclosures, and financial statements of Ashford.com and not to any of Amazon.com's accounting, disclosures, or financial statements. The settlement does not impose any civil penalty or other monetary sanction against Amazon.com or any of its employees, and it does not affect Amazon.com's results of operations or financial condition.

Exhibit 99.1 [AMAZON.COM GRAPHIC] AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES 28% SALES GROWTH FUELED BY LOWER PRICES; FREE SUPER SAVER SHIPPING ON ORDERS OVER $25 TO CONTINUE YEAR-ROUND SEATTLE -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- January 23, 2003 -- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASD: AMZN), today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

Net sales were a record $1.429 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $1.115 billion in the fourth quarter 2001, an increase of 28%. Net sales grew 26% to a record $3.933 billion for fiscal 2002, compared with $3.122 billion for 2001.

(Details on the differences between GAAP results and pro forma results are included below, with a tabular reconciliation of those differences included in the attached financial statements.) "On top of the five price cuts we've made over the past 18 months, we're announcing today that we've decided to make Free Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25 a full-time, year-round offer," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder and CEO. "We're at a tipping point. Customers are now shopping at Amazon.com as much for our lower prices as for our selection and convenience." In addition to its year-round Free Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25 at www.amazon.com, the Company offers free shipping options at its U.K., German, French, Japanese and Canadian sites. Amazon.com also offers 30% off books over $15 and significantly lowered prices on electronics, tools, and bestselling CDs and DVDs. "Our continued operational progress and momentum allow us to offer year-round free shipping and at the same time increase our 2003 guidance," said Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer of Amazon.com. "Our 2003 objective is to continue improving productivity and lowering prices for customers." HIGHLIGHTS OF FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2002 RESULTS (comparisons are with the equivalent period of 2001) - Worldwide unit growth was 34% for 2002. - Third-party seller transactions (new, used and refurbished items sold on Amazon.com product detail pages by businesses and individuals) grew to 21% of worldwide units in the fourth quarter, compared with 16% of units a year ago.

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE AND 2003 EXPECTATIONS The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 23, 2003.

This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general and of the Internet and online commerce; customer spending patterns; the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments; the mix of products sold to customers; the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services; competition; risks of inventory management; the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops service relationships with third-party sellers and other strategic transactions; foreign-currency exchange risks; seasonality; international growth and expansion; risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity; and fluctuations in the value of securities and non-cash payments Amazon.com receives in connection with such transactions. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant amount of indebtedness, potential fluctuations in operating results, management of potential growth, system interruptions, consumer trends, fulfillment center optimization, inventory, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, customer or third-party sellers fraud, Amazon.com Payments, and new business areas, business combinations and strategic alliances. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and all subsequent filings. PRO FORMA RESULTS Pro forma results, which generally exclude non-operational, non-cash expenses and income as well as one-time charges, are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (known as "GAAP"). Management uses such pro forma measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma is included in the attached financial statements. Page 2 of 16
Pro forma operating profit (loss) excludes the following line items on the Company's statements of operations: - Stock-based compensation, - Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and - Restructuring-related and other.

Page 12 of 16
AMAZON.COM, INC. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS (UNAUDITED) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all comparisons are with the equivalent period of the prior year) Net Sales - Net sales benefited from changes in foreign-currency exchange rates compared with the prior year by approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter 2002 ($3 million benefit to pro forma operating profit) and $47 million for fiscal 2002 ($4 million benefit to pro forma operating profit). - Shipping revenue, which excludes commissions earned from Amazon Marketplace, was approximately $121 million in the fourth quarter, down from $125 million. Gross Profit - Shipping costs increased 11% to $151 million in the fourth quarter 2002 and shipping loss increased to approximately $30 million, from a loss of $11 million. We continue to measure our shipping results relative to their effect on our overall financial results, with the viewpoint that shipping promotions are an effective marketing tool. We expect to continue offering our customers free shipping options, which reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and negatively affect gross margins. Fulfillment - Fulfillment costs represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing our fulfillment and customer service centers, credit card fees and bad debt costs. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third-party cosourcers, who assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Certain Services-segment fulfillment-related costs incurred on behalf of third-party sellers are classified as cost of sales rather than fulfillment. Stock-Based Compensation - During the first quarter 2001, we offered a limited non-compulsory exchange of employee stock options, which results in variable accounting treatment for approximately 5 million stock options at December 31, 2002, including approximately 4 million options granted under the exchange offer that have an exercise price of $13.375 and expire in the third quarter 2003. Variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable charges or credits dependent on the fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock, which we are unable to forecast. - At December 31, 2002, cumulative compensation expense associated with variable accounting treatment, including $31 million in the fourth quarter 2002, was approximately $60 million -- based on exercises to date and a quarter-end closing common stock price of $18.89 -- of which $40 million is associated with options exercised and no longer subject to future variability. - We have quantified the hypothetical effect on stock-based compensation associated with various quoted prices of our common stock using a sensitivity analysis for our outstanding stock options subject to variable accounting. We have provided this information to give additional insight into the volatility we will experience in our future results of operations to the extent that the quoted price for our common stock is above $13.375. This sensitivity analysis is not a prediction of future performance of the quoted prices of our common stock. Using the following hypothetical market prices of our common stock above $13.375 (including the actual expense associated with options exercised), our hypothetical cumulative compensation expense at December 31, 2002, and the difference between hypothetical cumulative compensation expense and actual cumulative compensation expense recorded at December 31, 2002, resulting from variable accounting treatment would have been as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Page 13 of 16
Actual variable-accounting-related compensation could differ significantly from the above illustration in instances where options are exercised during a period at prices that differ from the closing stock price for the reporting period. - Under our restricted stock unit program, which commenced in the fourth quarter 2002, we award restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding service period. To the extent that restricted stock units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles - As a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 and No. 142, during the first quarter 2002 we reclassified $25 million of other intangible assets (comprising only assembled workforce intangibles) into goodwill and discontinued the amortization of our goodwill. Restructuring-Related and Other - In January 2001, we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce our operating costs, streamline our organizational structure, consolidate certain of our fulfillment and customer service operations and migrate a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform. The restructuring plan is complete, although we may adjust our estimates prospectively if necessary. - Corresponding with our January 2001 operational restructuring, in the fourth quarter 2002 we reached a termination agreement with the landlord of our leased fulfillment center facility in McDonough, Georgia. This agreement requires payments totaling $12 million, $4 million of which was paid in the fourth quarter 2002 ($8 million is payable first quarter 2003). As a result of this agreement, in the fourth quarter 2002 we adjusted our restructuring liability to reflect current estimates of restructuring-related cash flows and recorded a $5 million restructuring-related gain. - Restructuring-related cash payments totaled $11 million in the fourth quarter 2002 (including the $4 million paid with respect to our McDonough facility), compared with $14 million. We anticipate the following net cash outflows associated with restructuring-related commitments (amounts due within 12 months are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the remaining amounts within long-term debt and other on our balance sheet): Page 14 of 16
(a) Net of anticipated sublease income of approximately $47 million (we have signed contractual sublease agreements covering $10 million in future payments) on gross lease obligations of $99 million. Other Income (Expense), Net - Other income, net includes net realized gains on sales of marketable securities. Other Gains (Losses), Net - Other losses, net primarily consist of a foreign-currency loss on the remeasurement of our 6.875% Euro-denominated convertible subordinated notes (PEACS) from Euros to U.S. dollars. We are unable to accurately forecast the effect on our future reported results associated with the remeasurement of the PEACS. Income Taxes - At December 31, 2002, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $2.5 billion related to U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Utilization of NOLs, which begin to expire at various times starting in 2010, may be subject to certain limitations. Approximately $1.2 billion of our NOLs relate to deductible stock-based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes -- to the extent any of this amount is realized, the resulting benefit will be credited to stockholders' equity, rather than results of operations. Net Income - Although we reported fourth quarter 2002 positive net income of $3 million, we believe that this positive net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not predictive of future trends for a variety of reasons. For example, excluding the $5 million restructuring-related gain associated with our McDonough, Georgia, fulfillment center lease-termination agreement, we would have reported a net loss in the fourth quarter 2002. Alternatively, excluding the $31 million stock-based compensation charge associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that resulted from an increase in our stock price during the fourth quarter, or excluding the $38 million foreign-currency loss on the remeasurement of our PEACS from Euros to U.S. dollars, we would have reported more net income in the fourth quarter 2002. - We are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items, including the stock-based compensation charges or credits associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that will result from fluctuations in our stock price, and the gain or loss associated with our PEACS that will result from fluctuations in foreign-currency rates. FINANCIAL CONDITION - Our marketable securities, at estimated fair value, consist of the following at December 31, 2002 (in millions): - At December 31, 2002, we have pledged approximately $121 million of our marketable securities as collateral for certain contractual obligations, compared with $167 million. Amounts pledged for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain contractual obligations, primarily property leases, were $58 million; $23 million is pledged for a swap agreement that hedges the foreign-exchange-rate risk on a portion of our PEACS; and $40 million is pledged for certain of our real estate lease agreements. The amount of marketable securities we are required to pledge pursuant to the swap agreement fluctuates with the fair market value of the swap obligation. Page 15 of 16
- Long-term debt primarily includes the following (in millions): (a) $256 million at December 31, 2002 (b) 690 million Euros CERTAIN DEFINITIONS AND OTHER - - Our segment reporting includes four segments: North America Books, Music and DVD/Video ("BMVD"); North America Electronics, Tools and Kitchen ("ETK"); International; and Services. Stock-based compensation, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and restructuring-related and other costs are not allocated to segment results. All other centrally incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. There are no internal transactions between the Company's reporting segments. - - The BMVD segment includes revenues, direct costs and cost allocations primarily associated with retail sales from www.amazon.com and www.amazon.ca for books, music, DVDs, video products and magazine subscription commissions. This segment also includes revenues from stores offering these products through our Syndicated Stores Program, such as www.borders.com, and commissions and other amounts earned from sales of these products offered by third-party sellers (businesses and individuals) under our Amazon Marketplace (such as a used out-of-print book) and Merchant@amazon.com Programs. - - The ETK segment includes revenues, direct costs and cost allocations primarily associated with www.amazon.com retail sales of electronics, home improvement and home and garden products, as well as our catalog sales of toys and tools. This segment also includes commissions and other amounts earned from sales of these products offered by third-party sellers under our Amazon Marketplace and Merchant@amazon.com Programs. - - The International segment includes all revenues, direct costs and cost allocations associated with the retail sales of our internationally focused U.K., German, French and Japanese Web sites -- www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp. This segment also includes commissions and other amounts earned from sales of products offered by third-party sellers under our Amazon Marketplace and Merchant@amazon.com Programs and revenues from stores offering products through our Syndicated Stores Program. - - The Services segment includes revenues, direct costs and cost allocations associated with certain of our commercial agreements, including the Merchant Program, such as www.target.com, and the Merchant@amazon.com Program to the extent full product categories are not also offered by our online retail stores, such as Toys and Games and Apparel and Accessories. This segment also includes our technology alliance with America Online and miscellaneous marketing, promotional and other agreements. - - All references to customers mean customer accounts, which are unique e-mail addresses, established either when a customer's initial order is shipped or when a customer orders from certain third-party sellers on our Web sites. Customer accounts include customers of Amazon Marketplace, Auctions and zShops and our Merchant@amazon.com and Syndicated Stores Programs, but exclude Merchant Program customers, Amazon.com Payments customers, our catalog customers and the customers of select companies with whom we have a technology alliance or marketing and promotional relationships. A customer is considered active upon placing an order. - - All references to units mean units sold (net of returns and cancellations) by us and third-party sellers at Amazon.com domains worldwide -- such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.jp -- and at Syndicated Stores domains, as well as Amazon.com-owned items sold at non-Amazon.com domains, such as books, music and DVD/video items ordered from Amazon.com's store at www.target.com.

ITEM 9.  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
     The Company's Letter to Shareholders, which accompanies its Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2002, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Table of Contents
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: April 10, 2003
Table of Contents

 
To our shareholders:
     
In many ways, Amazon.com is not a normal store. We have deep selection that is unconstrained by shelf space. We turn our inventory 19 times in a year. We personalize the store for each and every customer. We trade real estate for technology (which gets cheaper and more capable every year). We display customer reviews critical of our products. You can make a purchase with a few seconds and one click. We put used products next to new ones so you can choose. We share our prime real estate our product detail pages with third parties, and, if they can offer better value, we let them.
     
One of our most exciting peculiarities is poorly understood. People see that we're determined to offer both world-leading customer experience the lowest possible prices, but to some this dual goal seems paradoxical if not downright quixotic. Traditional stores face a time-tested tradeoff between offering high-touch customer experience on the one hand and the lowest possible prices on the other. How can Amazon.com be trying to do both?
and
     
The answer is that we transform much of customer experience such as unmatched selection, extensive product information, personalized recommendations, and other new software features into largely a fixed expense. With customer experience costs largely fixed (more like a publishing model than a retailing model), our costs as a percentage of sales can shrink rapidly as we grow our business. Moreover, customer experience costs that remain variable such as the variable portion of fulfillment costs improve in our model as we reduce defects. Eliminating defects improves costs and leads to better customer experience.
     
We believe our ability to lower prices and simultaneously drive customer experience is a big deal, and this past year offers evidence that the strategy is working.
     
First, we do continue to drive customer experience. The holiday season this year is one example. While delivering a record number of units to customers, we also delivered our best-ever experience. Cycle time, the amount of time taken by our fulfillment centers to process an order, improved 17% compared with last year. And our most sensitive measure of customer satisfaction, contacts per order, saw a 13% improvement.
     
Inside existing product categories, we've worked hard to increase selection. Electronics selection is up over 40% in the U.S. alone over the prior year, and we now offer 10 times the selection of a typical big box electronics store. Even in U.S. books, where we've been working for 8 years, we increased selection by 15%, mostly in harder-to-find and out-of-print titles. And, of course, we've added new categories. Our Apparel and Accessories store has more than 500 top clothing brands, and in its first 60 days, customers bought 153,000 shirts, 106,000 pairs of pants, and 31,000 pairs of underwear.
     
In this year's American Customer Satisfaction Index, the most authoritative study of customer satisfaction, Amazon.com scored an 88, the highest score ever recorded not just online, not just in retailing but the highest score ever recorded in any service industry. In ACSI's words:
     
Second, while focused on customer experience, we've also been lowering price substantially. We've been doing so broadly across product categories, from books to electronics, and we've eliminated shipping fees with our 365 day-per-year Free Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. We've been taking similar actions in every country in which we do business.
     
Our pricing objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices everyday and apply them broadly across our entire product range. To illustrate this point, we
 
recently did a price comparison versus a major well-known chain of book superstores. We did not hand pick a choice group of books against which we wanted to compare. Instead, we used their published list of their 100 bestsellers for 2002. It was a good representation of the kinds of books people buy most, consisting of 45 hardcover titles and 55 paperbacks across many different categories, including Literature, Romance, Mystery and Thrillers, Nonfiction, Children's, Self-Help, and so on.
     
We priced all 100 titles by visiting their superstores in both Seattle and New York City. It took us six hours in four of their different superstores to find all 100 books on their list. When we added up everything we spent, we discovered that:
     
To be sure, you may find reasons to shop in the physical worldfor instance, if you need something immediatelybut, if you do so, you'll be paying a premium. If you want to save money and time, you'll do better by shopping at Amazon.com.
     
Third, our determination to deliver low price customer experience is generating financial results. Net sales this year increased 26% to a record $3.9 billion, and unit sales grew at an even faster 34%. Free cash flowour most important financial measurereached $135 million, a $305 million improvement over the prior year.
and
1
     
In short, what's good for customers is good for shareholders.
     
Once again this year, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter and encourage current and prospective shareowners to take a look at it. Given how much we've grown and how much the Internet has evolved, it's notable that the fundamentals of how we do business remain the same.
     
As always, we at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.
     
1
 Free cash flow for 2002 of $135 million is net cash provided by operating activities of $174 million less purchases of fixed assets of $39 million. Free cash flow for 2001 of negative $170 million is net cash used in operating activities of $120 million less purchases of fixed assets of $50 million.
 
To our shareholders:
     
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
     
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
     
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
     
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
     
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
     
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
     
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
     
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
     
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
SM
     
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
     
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
     
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
     
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
     
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
     
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
     
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)April 24, 2003Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
Operating cash flow was $164 million for the trailing four quarters, compared with $46 million for the four quarters ended March 31, 2002. Free cash flow was $123 million for the trailing four quarters, compared with $10 million for the four quarters ended March 31, 2002.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based employee awards totaled 432 million at March 31, 2003, a decrease of 1% compared with a year ago.
Net sales were $1.084 billion in the first quarter, compared with $847 million in the first quarter 2002, an increase of 28%.
Net loss was $10 million, or $(0.03) per share, in the first quarter, compared with $23 million in the first quarter 2002, or $(0.06) per share. Pro forma net income in the first quarter, which includes interest expense, grew over $45 million to $40 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with a pro forma net loss of $5 million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter 2002.
"Our strategy of driving down costs to give customers lower prices continues to pay off," said Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer of Amazon.com. "In the first quarter, customers took advantage of Free Super Saver Shipping and broad everyday low prices, which created our first-ever non-holiday quarter with sales over $1 billion, but this was only possible because we reduced our costs in virtually every area of our business."
In addition to its year-round Free Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25 at www.amazon.com, the Company offers free shipping options at its U.K., German, French, Japanese and Canadian sites. Amazon.com also offers 30% off books over $15 and significantly lowered prices on electronics, tools, and bestselling CDs and DVDs.
"Meaningful innovation leads, launches, inspires relentless Amazon visitor improvements," said Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com. "We are simultaneously lowering prices and driving customer experience."
The Company also announced that on May 28, 2003, it will redeem all of its outstanding 10% Senior Discount Notes due May 2008, for $277 million, a redemption price of 105% of the $264 million principal amount.
See "Financial Measures" for additional information about certain of our financial measures.
 
(comparisons are with the equivalent period of 2002)
Highlights of First Quarter 2003 Results
Financial Guidance and 2003 Expectations
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 24, 2003. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the emerging nature and rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
     Second Quarter 2003 Guidance
     Full Year 2003 Expectations
The Company is unable to forecast the effect on its future reported results of certain items, including the stock-based compensation charges or credits associated with variable accounting treatment on certain stock awards that result from fluctuations in its stock price, and the gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of its 6.875% PEACS that results from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, because stock-based compensation and remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other are impossible to predict, the Company cannot estimate future operating income (loss) or net income (loss).
A conference call will be Webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will be available through June 30, 2003, at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general and of the Internet and online commerce; customer spending patterns; world events, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments; the mix of products sold to customers; the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services; competition; risks of inventory management; the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements and strategic transactions; foreign exchange risks; seasonality; international growth and expansion; and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant amount of indebtedness, potential fluctuations in operating results, management of potential growth, system interruptions, consumer trends, fulfillment center optimization, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and all subsequent filings.

Management uses this measure internally to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations. A tabular reconciliation of differences from the comparable GAAP measureoperating cash flowis included in the attached "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics."
Consolidated Segment Operating Income
Consolidated segment operating income, a GAAP measure, excludes the following line items on the Company's statements of operations:

Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)July 22, 2003Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Operating cash flow was $285 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $48 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2002. Free cash flow was $245 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $16 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2002.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based employee awards totaled 433 million at June 30, 2003, an increase of 1% compared with a year ago.
Net sales were $1.1 billion in the second quarter, compared with $806 million in the second quarter 2002, an increase of 37%. Net sales benefited by $55 million from changes in foreign exchange rates compared with the second quarter 2002.
Operating income was $42 million, or 4% of net sales, compared with $1 million in the second quarter 2002. Consolidated segment operating income improved $41 million to $67 million, or 6% of net sales, compared with $26 million in the second quarter 2002.
Net loss was $43 million, or $(0.11) per share, in the second quarter, compared with $94 million, or $(0.25) per share, in the second quarter 2002. Pro forma net income in the second quarter, which includes interest expense, grew over $46 million to $42 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with a pro forma net loss of $4 million, or $(0.01) per share, in the second quarter 2002.
"In January, we shifted money from TV and print advertising to customers through lower prices and free shipping," said Amazon.com founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos. "We're pleased with the results."
Today the Company also announced it is lowering its Free Super Saver Delivery threshold in the U.K. to 25 from 39. The Company currently offers Free Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25 at www.amazon.com and free shipping options at its German, French, Japanese and Canadian sites. Amazon.com also offers 30% off books over $15 and significant savings on electronics, tools, and bestselling CDs and DVDs.
"Amazon.com customers continue to respond in record numbers to our everyday low prices and free shipping," said Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer of Amazon.com. "Our strategy of offering low prices and free shipping, combined with the inherent advantages of online shopping, is allowing us to raise our guidance."

Highlights of Second Quarter 2003 Results
 
Financial Guidance and 2003 Expectations
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 22, 2003. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the emerging nature and rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
A conference call will be Webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will be available at least through September 30, 2003, at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments; the mix of products sold to customers; the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services; competition; risks of inventory management; the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements and strategic transactions; seasonality; international growth and expansion; and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant amount of indebtedness, potential fluctuations in operating results, management of potential growth, system interruptions, consumer trends, fulfillment center optimization, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and all subsequent filings.

Certain Definitions and Other
 

 
Exhibit 99.2
          Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income (loss)," "pro forma net income (loss)," "pro forma net income (loss) per share," and "free cash flow."
          We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
          Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
          
Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
          We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
          These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income (loss), which we reconcile to GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
          We use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
          
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
               
Stock-Based Compensation
          We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
          We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
               
Amortization of Other Intangibles
          We exclude "Amortization of other intangibles" for the following reasons:
               
Restructuring-Related and Other
          We exclude restructuring related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons:
          
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
          Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
 
          Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes "Restructuring-related and other." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re-evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based on those future facts and circumstances at that time.
     
Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
          Pro forma net income (loss), including the related pro forma net income (loss) per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
          We use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
          
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
               See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Excluded Items" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Amortization of other intangibles," and "Restructuring-related and other."
               
Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other
          The majority of "Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, this line item includes $15 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10% Senior Discount Notes and $6 million of losses associated with the termination of our Euro Currency Swap, each of which occurred in the second quarter of 2003.
               
Equity in Losses of Equity-Method Investees, Net
          We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Finally, in recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue. In the second quarter 2003, we recorded no equity method losses or gains.
               
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
          We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
          
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
          Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by valuing the 6.875% PEACS at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and including that fair value in our summary of commitments in the notes to our financial statements.
          
Free Cash Flow
          Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and Web site development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate selling significant portions of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
          
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
          Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, it does not exclude payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Certain Definitions and Other

 
Exhibit 99.2
     Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income (loss)," "pro forma net income (loss)," "pro forma net earnings (loss) per share," and "free cash flow."
     We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
     Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     
Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
     We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
     These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income (loss), which we reconcile to GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
     We use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
     
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
          
Stock-Based Compensation
     We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
     We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and
 
"General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
          
Amortization of Other Intangibles
     We exclude "Amortization of other intangibles" for the following reasons:
          
Restructuring-Related and Other
     We exclude restructuring-related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons:
          
Impairment of Goodwill
     If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
     
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
     Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by
 
providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
     Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes "Restructuring-related and other." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re-evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based on those future facts and circumstances at that time.
     
Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
     Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
     We use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
     
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
     See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Excluded Items" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Amortization of other intangibles," "Restructuring-related and other," and "Impairment of goodwill."
          
Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other
 
     The majority of "Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, this line item includes $15 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10% Senior Discount Notes and $6 million of losses associated with the termination of our Euro Currency Swap, each of which occurred in the second quarter of 2003.
          
Equity in Losses of Equity-Method Investees, Net
     We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Finally, in recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue. In the third quarter 2003, we recorded no equity method losses or gains.
          
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
     We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
     
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
     Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by valuing the 6.875% PEACS at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and including that fair value in our summary of commitments in the notes to our financial statements.
     
Free Cash Flow
     Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and Website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based
 
on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate selling significant portions of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
     
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
     Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Highlights of Fourth Quarter and 2003 Results
 
 
 
operating income was $39 million, or 5% of net sales, in the fourth quarter, compared with $20 million, or 4% of net sales, in fourth quarter 2002.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Guidance
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 27, 2004. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the emerging nature and rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
 
First Quarter 2004 Guidance
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2004 Expectations
 
 
 
 
A conference call will be Webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will be available at least through March 31, 2004, at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments; the mix of products sold to customers; the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services; competition; risks of inventory management; the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements and strategic transactions; seasonality; international growth and expansion; and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant amount of indebtedness, potential fluctuations in operating results, management of potential growth, system interruptions, consumer trends, fulfillment center optimization, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and all subsequent filings.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income (loss)," "pro forma net income (loss)," "pro forma net earnings (loss) per share," and "free cash flow."
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
 
We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
 
 
 
These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income (loss), which we reconcile to GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
We use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
 
Amortization of Other Intangibles
 
We exclude "Amortization of other intangibles" for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
Restructuring-Related and Other
 
We exclude restructuring-related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during 2003.
 
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)
 
Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
 
Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes "Restructuring-related and other." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re-evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based on those future facts and circumstances at that time.
 
Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
 
Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
 
We use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
 
See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Excluded Items" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Amortization of other intangibles," "Restructuring-related and other," and "Impairment of goodwill."
 
Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other
 
The majority of "Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, this line item includes $24 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10% Senior Discount Notes and a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Notes, and $6 million of losses associated with the termination of our Euro Currency Swap.
 
Equity in Losses of Equity-Method Investees, Net
 
We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Finally, in recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue. In the third quarter 2003, we recorded no equity method losses or gains.
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income (Loss)
 
Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption, or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by valuing the 6.875% PEACS at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and including that fair value in our summary of commitments in the notes to our financial statements.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and Web site development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate selling significant portions of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
The Company's Letter to Shareholders, which accompanies its Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2003, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: April 12, 2004
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
To our shareholders:
 
Long-term thinking is both a requirement and an outcome of true ownership. Owners are different from tenants. I know of a couple who rented out their house, and the family who moved in nailed their Christmas tree to the hardwood floors instead of using a tree stand. Expedient, I suppose, and admittedly these were particularly bad tenants, but no owner would be so short-sighted. Similarly, many investors are effectively short-term tenants, turning their portfolios so quickly they are really just renting the stocks that they temporarily "own."
 
We emphasized our long-term views in our 1997 letter to shareholders, our first as a public company, because that approach really does drive making many concrete, non-abstract decisions. I'd like to discuss a few of these non-abstract decisions in the context of customer experience. At Amazon.com, we use the term customer experience broadly. It includes every customer-facing aspect of our businessfrom our product prices to our selection, from our website's user interface to how we package and ship items. The customer experience we create is by far the most important driver of our business.
 
As we design our customer experience, we do so with long-term owners in mind. We try to make all of our customer experience decisionsbig and smallin that framework.
 
For instance, shortly after launching Amazon.com in 1995, we empowered customers to review products. While now a routine Amazon.com practice, at the time we received complaints from a few vendors, basically wondering if we understood our business: "You make money when you sell thingswhy would you allow negative reviews on your website?" Speaking as a focus group of one, I know I've sometimes changed my mind before making purchases on Amazon.com as a result of negative or lukewarm customer reviews. Though negative reviews cost us some sales in the short term, helping customers make better purchase decisions ultimately pays off for the company.
 
Another example is our Instant Order Update feature, which reminds you that you've already bought a particular item. Customers lead busy lives and cannot always remember if they've already purchased a particular item, say a DVD or CD they bought a year earlier. When we launched Instant Order Update, we were able to measure with statistical significance that the feature slightly reduced sales. Good for customers? Definitely. Good for shareowners? Yes, in the long run.
 
Among the most expensive customer experience improvements we're focused on are our everyday free-shipping offers and our ongoing product price reductions. Eliminating defects, improving productivity, and passing the resulting cost savings back to customers in the form of lower prices is a long-term decision. Increased volumes take time to materialize, and price reductions almost always hurt current results. In the long term, however, relentlessly driving the "price-cost structure loop" will leave us with a stronger, more valuable business. Since many of our costs, such as software engineering, are relatively fixed and many of our variable costs can also be better managed at larger scale, driving more volume through our cost structure reduces those costs as a percentage of sales. To give one small example, engineering a feature like Instant Order Update for use by 40 million customers costs nowhere near 40 times what it would cost to do the same for 1 million customers.
 
Our pricing strategy does not attempt to maximize margin , but instead seeks to drive maximum value for customers and thereby create a much larger bottom linein the long term. For example, we're targeting gross margins on our jewelry sales to be substantially lower than industry norms because we believe over timecustomers figure these things outthis approach will produce more value for shareholders.
percentages
We have a strong team of hard-working, innovative folks building Amazon.com. They are focused on the customer and focused on the long term. On that time scale, the interests of shareowners and customers are aligned.
 
As always, I attach our 1997 letter and believe it is still worth a read. Here's to not being a tenant!
 
 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
 
P.S. Again this year, the widely-followed American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Amazon.com a score of 88the highest customer satisfaction score ever recorded in any service industry, online or off. A representative of the ACSI was quoted as saying, "If they go any higher, they will get a nose bleed." We're working on that.
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income," "pro forma net income," "pro forma net earnings per share," and "free cash flow."
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income and pro forma net income are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and for a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
 
 
These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income, which we reconcile to GAAP operating income. Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
We use consolidated segment operating income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
 
Other Operating Expense (Income)
 
We exclude other operating expense (income), including amortization of other intangibles and restructuring-related and other, which are cash and non-cash items for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the three months ended March 31, 2004.
 
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Consolidated segment operating income has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
 
Second, consolidated segment operating income excludes "Other Operating Expense (Income)." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re-evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income based on those future facts and circumstances at that time.
 
Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income, the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
We use pro forma net income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. We use this financial measure as it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income
 
See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Other operating expense (income)," and "Impairment of goodwill."
 
Remeasurements and Other
 
A portion of "Remeasurements and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, which are included in "Remeasurements and other," because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. In recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue.
 
To the extent we incur gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption, or retirements of our debt instruments, such amounts will be recorded to "Remeasurements and other."
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Financial Guidance
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 22, 2004. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the emerging nature and rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.

Certain Definitions and Other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income," "pro forma net income," "pro forma net earnings per share," and "free cash flow."
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income and pro forma net income are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and for a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
 
 
These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income, which we reconcile to GAAP operating income. Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
We use consolidated segment operating income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
 
Other Operating Expense (Income)
 
We exclude other operating expense (income), including amortization of other intangibles and restructuring-related and other, which are cash and non-cash items for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the first half of 2004.
 
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Consolidated segment operating income has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
Second, consolidated segment operating income excludes "Other Operating Expense (Income)." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding restructuring-related costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. Since we have initiated in the second quarter of 2004 a restructuring event in Europe, we have re-evaluated our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income. We have determined that it continues to be appropriate since it has been over two years since our last restructuring event, and we do not anticipate another restructuring event in the next two years. There can, however, be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows.
 
Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income, the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
We use pro forma net income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. We use this financial measure as it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income
 
See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Other operating expense (income)," and "Impairment of goodwill."
 
Remeasurements and Other
 
A portion of "Remeasurements and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, which are included in "Remeasurements and other," because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. In recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue.
To the extent we incur gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption, or retirements of our debt instruments, such amounts will be recorded to "Remeasurements and other."
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements.
 
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, our reported net income was greater than our pro forma net income.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
On August 19, 2004, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Joyo.com Limited ("Joyo.com"), a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Joyo.com operates and in the People's Republic of China ("PRC") in cooperation with a PRC subsidiary and PRC affiliates.
www.joyo.com
www.joyo.com.cn
 
The transaction is valued at approximately $75 million, including approximately $72 million in cash and the assumption of employee stock options. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter 2004, although it is subject to customary closing conditions.
 
The PRC regulates Joyo.com's business through regulations and license requirements restricting (i) the scope of foreign investment in the Internet, retail and delivery sectors, (ii) Internet content and (iii) the sale of certain media products. In order to meet the PRC local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, Joyo.com's business is operated through a PRC subsidiary which acts in cooperation with PRC companies owned by nominee shareholders who are PRC nationals. Although we believe Joyo.com's structure complies with existing PRC laws, it involves unique risks. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC laws and regulations, and it is possible that the PRC government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. If Joyo.com or its subsidiary or affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely. In addition, if Joyo.com were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business, it might be unable to continue to operate the business. Our acquisition and operation of Joyo.com also will be subject to many of the risks described in "Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results", including risks of acquisitions and of doing business internationally, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent filings.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures that meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income," "pro forma net income," "pro forma net earnings per share," and "free cash flow."
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income and pro forma net income are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
 
 
 
These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income, which we reconcile to GAAP operating income. Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Our management believes that consolidated segment operating income (loss) is useful and meaningful to investors because consolidated segment operating income (loss), together with pro forma net income (loss), and
 
ratios based on them, are the primary measures of profitability that we use to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment operating income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
 
Other Operating Expense (Income)
 
We exclude other operating expense (income), including amortization of other intangibles and restructuring-related and other, which are cash and non-cash items for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the nine months ended September 30,2004.
 
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Consolidated segment operating income has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We
 
compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
 
Second, consolidated segment operating income excludes "Other Operating Expense (Income)." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding restructuring-related costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. Since we have initiated in the second quarter of 2004 a restructuring event in Europe, we have re-evaluated our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income. We have determined that it continues to be appropriate since it has been over two years since our last restructuring event, and we do not anticipate another restructuring event in the next two years. There can, however, be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows.
 
Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income, the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
We use pro forma net income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. We use this financial measure as it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income
 
See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Other operating expense (income)," and "Impairment of goodwill."
 
Remeasurements and Other
 
A portion of "Remeasurements and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, which are included in "Remeasurements and other," because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. In recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue.
 
To the extent we incur gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption, or retirements of our debt instruments, such amounts will be recorded to "Remeasurements and other."
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements.
 
During certain of our reporting periods our reported net income was greater than our pro forma net income.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions such as our third quarter 2004 acquisition of Joyo.com. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures that meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: "consolidated segment operating income," "pro forma net income," "pro forma net earnings per share," and "free cash flow."
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
 
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income and pro forma net income are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see "Pro Forma Statements of Operations" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes:
 
 
 
 
These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income, which we reconcile to GAAP operating income. Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Our management believes that consolidated segment operating income (loss) is useful and meaningful to investors because consolidated segment operating income (loss), together with pro forma net income (loss), and
 
ratios based on them, are the primary measures of profitability that we use to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment operating income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in "Fulfillment," "Marketing," "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in "Stock-based compensation."
 
Other Operating Expense (Income)
 
We exclude other operating expense (income), including amortization of other intangibles and restructuring-related and other, which are cash and non-cash items for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
 
Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income
 
Consolidated segment operating income has certain limitations. First, because it excludes "Stock-based compensation," the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We
 
compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements.
 
Second, consolidated segment operating income excludes "Other Operating Expense (Income)." For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding restructuring-related costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. Since we have initiated in the second quarter of 2004 a restructuring event in Europe, we have re-evaluated our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income. We have determined that it continues to be appropriate since it has been over two years since our last restructuring event, and we do not anticipate another restructuring event in the next two years. There can, however, be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows.
 
Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income, including the related pro forma net earnings per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income, the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
We use pro forma net income, and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. We use this financial measure as it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both.
 
Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income
 
See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income" for an explanation of "Stock-based compensation," "Other operating expense (income)," and "Impairment of goodwill."
 
Remeasurements and Other
 
A portion of "Remeasurements and other" consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods.
 
We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, which are included in "Remeasurements and other," because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. In recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue.
 
To the extent we incur gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption, or retirements of our debt instruments, such amounts will be recorded to "Remeasurements and other."
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance.
 
Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income
 
Pro forma net income has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See "Consolidated Segment Operating Income  Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income" above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements.
 
During certain of our reporting periods our reported net income was greater than our pro forma net income.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Limitations of Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions such as our third quarter 2004 acquisition of Joyo.com. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Table of Contents
SIGNATURES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: April 5, 2005
Table of Contents
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Our ultimate financial measure, and the one we most want to drive over the long-term, is free cash flow per share.
 
Why not focus first and foremost, as many do, on earnings, earnings per share or earnings growth? The simple answer is that earnings don't directly translate into cash flows, and shares are worth only the present value of their future cash flows, not the present value of their future earnings. Future earnings are a componentbut not the only important componentof future cash flow per share. Working capital and capital expenditures are also important, as is future share dilution.
 
Though some may find it counterintuitive, a company can actually impair shareholder value in certain circumstances by growing earnings. This happens when the capital investments required for growth exceed the present value of the cash flow derived from those investments.
 
To illustrate with a hypothetical and very simplified example, imagine that an entrepreneur invents a machine that can quickly transport people from one location to another. The machine is expensive$160 million with an annual capacity of 100,000 passenger trips and a four year useful life. Each trip sells for $1,000 and requires $450 in cost of goods for energy and materials and $50 in labor and other costs.
 
Continue to imagine that business is booming, with 100,000 trips in Year 1, completely and perfectly utilizing the capacity of one machine. This leads to earnings of $10 million after deducting operating expenses including depreciationa 10% net margin. The company's primary focus is on earnings; so based on initial results the entrepreneur decides to invest more capital to fuel sales and earnings growth, adding additional machines in Years 2 through 4.
 
Here are the income statements for the first four years of business:
 
 
It's impressive: 100% compound earnings growth and $150 million of cumulative earnings. Investors considering only the above income statement would be delighted.
However, looking at cash flows tells a different story. Over the same four years, the transportation business generates cumulative negative free cash flow of $530 million.
 
 
There are of course other business models where earnings more closely approximate cash flows. But as our transportation example illustrates, one cannot assess the creation or destruction of shareholder value with certainty by looking at the income statement alone.
 
Notice, too, that a focus on EBITDAEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortizationwould lead to the same faulty conclusion about the health of the business. Sequential annual EBITDA would have been $50, $100, $200 and $400 million100% growth for three straight years. But without taking into account the $1.28 billion in capital expenditures necessary to generate this cash flow,' we're getting only part of the storyEBITDA isn't cash flow.
 
What if we modified the growth rates and, correspondingly, capital expenditures for machinerywould cash flows have deteriorated or improved?
 
 
Paradoxically, from a cash flow perspective, the slower this business grows the better off it is. Once the initial capital outlay has been made for the first machine, the ideal growth trajectory is to scale to 100% of capacity quickly, then stop growing. However, even with only one piece of machinery, the gross cumulative cash flow doesn't surpass the initial machine cost until Year 4 and the net present value of this stream of cash flows (using 12% cost of capital) is still negative.
 
Unfortunately our transportation business is fundamentally flawed. There is no growth rate at which it makes sense to invest initial or subsequent capital to operate the business. In fact, our example is so simple and clear as to be obvious. Investors would run a net present value analysis on the economics and quickly determine it doesn't pencil out. Though it's more subtle and complex in the real world, this issuethe duality between earnings and cash flowscomes up all the time.
 
Cash flow statements often don't receive as much attention as they deserve. Discerning investors don't stop with the income statement.
 
Our Most Important Financial Measure: Free Cash Flow Per Share
 
Amazon.com's financial focus is on long-term growth in free cash flow per share.
 
Amazon.com's free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating profit dollars and efficiently managing both working capital and capital expenditures. We work to increase operating profit by focusing on improving all aspects of the customer experience to grow sales and by maintaining a lean cost structure.
We have a cash generative operating cycle
1
because we turn our inventory quickly, collecting payments from our customers before payments are due to suppliers. Our high inventory turnover means we maintain relatively low levels of investment in inventory$480 million at year end on a sales base of nearly $7 billion.
 
The capital efficiency of our business model is illustrated by our modest investments in fixed assets, which were $246 million at year end or 4% of 2004 sales.
 
Free cash flow
2
grew 38% to $477 million in 2004, a $131 million improvement over the prior year. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experienceincluding increasing selection and lowering pricesand execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.
 
As to dilution, total shares outstanding plus stock-based awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2004 compared with 2003, and are down 1% over the last three years. During that same period, we've also eliminated over six million shares of potential future dilution by repaying more than $600 million of convertible debt that was due in 2009 and 2010. Efficiently managing share count means more cash flow per share and more long-term value for owners.
 
This focus on free cash flow isn't new for Amazon.com. We made it clear in our 1997 letter to shareholdersour first as a public companythat when "forced to choose between optimizing GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we'll take the cash flows." I'm attaching a copy of our complete 1997 letter and encourage current and prospective shareowners to take a look at it.
 
As always, we at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.
 
 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
April 2005
 
 
 
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS; FOR THE FIRST TIME SALES OF ELECTRONICS & OTHER GENERAL MERCHANDISE SURPASS $1.8 BILLION AND COMPRISE 25% OF TOTAL SALES OVER THE PAST YEAR
 
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)April 26, 2005Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2005.
 
Operating cash flow grew 33% to $523 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $393 million for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2004. Free cash flow grew 21% to $417 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $344 million for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2004.
 
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 434 million at March 31, 2005, compared with 432 million a year ago.
 
Net sales increased 24% to $1.90 billion in the first quarter, compared with $1.53 billion in first quarter 2004. Excluding the $30 million benefit from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with first quarter 2004.
 
Operating income declined 2% to $108 million in the first quarter, compared with $110 million in first quarter 2004. As previously announced, the Company chose to adopt SFAS 123(R), the new accounting rules on stock-based compensation, earlier than required, effective January 1, 2005. Excluding the $14 million impact due to this adoption, operating income would have grown 10% to $122 million. Operating income benefited by $3 million from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter.
 
Net income was $78 million in the first quarter, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with net income of $111 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in first quarter 2004. Net income for the first quarter includes $56 million in income tax expense, compared with a $2 million income tax benefit in first quarter 2004. First quarter also includes a $26 million gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the Company's early adoption of SFAS 123(R).
 
"We're seeing especially heavy use of Amazon Prime in Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, and Health & Personal Care," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat' free express shipping. Getting your items right away changes the way you use and think about Amazon.com."
 
Amazon Prime, Amazon.com's first-ever membership program, was introduced February 2005. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited, express two-day shipping for free, with no minimum purchase requirement on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com. Members can order as late as 6:30 p.m. ET and still get their order the next day for only $3.99 per item, and can share the benefits of Amazon Prime with up to four family members living in their household.
 
Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Guidance
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 26, 2005. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
 
Second Quarter 2005 Guidance
 
 
 
Full Year 2005 Expectations
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of
 
inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant indebtedness, system interruptions, consumer trends, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud, and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and all subsequent filings.
 
Financial Measure
 
The following measure is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-GAAP financial measure.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Operating cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, including cash outflows for interest and excluding proceeds from the exercise of stock-based employee awards. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less cash outflows for purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development. A tabular reconciliation of differences from the comparable GAAP measureoperating cash flowis included in the attached "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics."

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Free Cash Flow
 
Regulation G, , and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to
cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)July 26, 2005Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 
Operating cash flow grew 52% to $624 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $410 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow grew 37% to $486 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $354 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2004.
 
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 438 million at June 30, 2005, compared with 434 million a year ago.
 
Net sales increased 26% to $1.75 billion in the second quarter, compared with $1.39 billion in second quarter 2004. Excluding the $25 million benefit from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 25% compared with second quarter 2004.
 
Operating income increased 21% to $104 million in the second quarter, compared with $86 million in second quarter 2004. As previously announced, the Company chose to adopt SFAS 123(R), the new accounting rules on stock-based compensation, earlier than required, effective January 1, 2005. Excluding the more than $5 million impact on the quarter's results from this adoption, operating income would have grown 27% to $110 million. Operating income benefited by $2 million from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter.
 
Net income was $52 million in the second quarter, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with net income of $76 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in second quarter 2004, which includes $56 million in income tax expense, compared with $5 million income tax expense in second quarter 2004.
 
"Amazon Prime members love getting unlimited two-day shipping for free with no minimum order size," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "Though expensive for the company, Amazon Prime creates a premium experience for customers who join, and as a result we hope they'll purchase more from us in the long term."
 
Amazon Prime, Amazon.com's first-ever membership program, was introduced February 2005. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited, express two-day shipping for free, with no minimum purchase requirement on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com.

"We are pleased with our $486 million of free cash flow, up 37%," said Tom Szkutak, CFO of Amazon.com. "We continue to offer lower prices and free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members while generating additional free cash flow for our shareholders."

Financial Guidance
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 26, 2005. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant indebtedness, system interruptions, consumer trends, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud, and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities
 
and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and all subsequent filings.

Free Cash Flow
 
Operating cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, including cash outflows for interest and excluding proceeds from the exercise of stock-based employee awards. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less cash outflows for purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, , and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows.
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
In addition, the Company's earnings release included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial information which excludes a payment to settle a patent lawsuit from free cash flow, operating income, net income and related financial measures. Management uses these financial measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance in the third quarter of 2005, and for budgeting and planning purposes, because the timing and amount of the charge is not attributable to operating events occurring during the quarter and the charge is not readily allocable to prior period operating results. Management thus believes that these financial measures enhance the comparability of our operating results from period to period.
 
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Financial Guidance
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of February 2, 2006. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant indebtedness, system interruptions, consumer trends, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud, and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and all subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Regulation G, , and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows.
 
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
 
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, which excludes the employer portion of payroll tax expense. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. It should be noted, however, that stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and GAAP indicates that all forms of stock-based awards should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
 
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Many of the important decisions we make at Amazon.com can be made with data. There is a right answer or a wrong answer, a better answer or a worse answer, and math tells us which is which. These are our favorite kinds of decisions.
 
Opening a new fulfillment center is an example. We use history from our existing fulfillment network to estimate seasonal peaks and to model alternatives for new capacity. We look at anticipated product mix, including product dimensions and weight, to decide how much space we need and whether we need a facility for smaller "sortable" items or for larger items that usually ship alone. To shorten delivery times and reduce outbound transportation costs, we analyze prospective locations based on proximity to customers, transportation hubs, and existing facilities. Quantitative analysis improves the customer's experience and our cost structure.
 
Similarly, most of our inventory purchase decisions can be numerically modeled and analyzed. We want products in stock and immediately available to customers, and we want minimal total inventory in order to keep associated holding costs, and thus prices, low. To achieve both, there is a right amount of inventory. We use historical purchase data to forecast customer demand for a product and expected variability in that demand. We use data on the historical performance of vendors to estimate replenishment times. We can determine where to stock the product within our fulfillment network based on inbound and outbound transportation costs, storage costs, and anticipated customer locations. With this approach, we keep over one million unique items under our own roof, immediately available for customers, while still turning inventory more than fourteen times per year.
 
The above decisions require us to make some assumptions and judgments, but in such decisions, judgment and opinion come into play only as junior partners. The heavy lifting is done by the math.
 
As you would expect, however, not all of our important decisions can be made in this enviable, math-based way. Sometimes we have little or no historical data to guide us and proactive experimentation is impossible, impractical, or tantamount to a decision to proceed. Though data, analysis, and math play a role, the prime ingredient in these decisions is judgment
.
1
 
As our shareholders know, we have made a decision to continuously and significantly lower prices for customers year after year as our efficiency and scale make it possible. This is an example of a very important decision that cannot be made in a math-based way. In fact, when we lower prices, we go against the math that we can do, which always says that the smart move is to prices. We have significant data related to price elasticity. With fair accuracy, we can predict that a price reduction of a certain percentage will result in an increase in units sold of a certain percentage. With rare exceptions, the volume increase in the short term is never enough to pay for the price decrease. However, our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years or more. Our is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices
raise
judgment
 
creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com. We've made similar judgments around Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime, both of which are expensive in the short term andwe believeimportant and valuable in the long term.
 
As another example, in 2000 we invited third parties to compete directly against us on our "prime retail real estate"our product detail pages. Launching a single detail page for both Amazon retail and third-party items seemed risky. Well-meaning people internally and externally worried it would cannibalize Amazon's retail business, andas is often the case with consumer-focused innovationsthere was no way to prove in advance that it would work. Our buyers pointed out that inviting third parties onto Amazon.com would make inventory forecasting more difficult and that we could get "stuck" with excess inventory if we "lost the detail page" to one of our third-party sellers. However, our judgment was simple. If a third party could offer a better price or better availability on a particular item, then we wanted our customer to get easy access to that offer. Over time, third-party sales have become a successful and significant part of our business. Third-party units have grown from 6% of total units sold in 2000 to 28% in 2005, even as retail revenues have grown three-fold.
 
Math-based decisions command wide agreement, whereas judgment-based decisions are rightly debated and often controversial, at least until put into practice and demonstrated. Any institution unwilling to endure controversy must limit itself to decisions of the first type. In our view, doing so would not only limit controversy it would also significantly limit innovation and long-term value creation.
 
The foundation of our decision-making philosophy was laid out in our 1997 letter to shareholders, a copy of which is attached:
 
 
 
 
 
You can count on us to combine a strong quantitative and analytical culture with a willingness to make bold decisions. As we do so, we'll start with the customer and work backwards. In our judgment, that is the best way to create shareholder value.
 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
Founder and Chief Executive Officer
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 25, 2006. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
Second Quarter 2006 Guidance
 
 
Full Year 2006 Expectations
 
 
We are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our Toysrus.com contract and are seeking a stay of the termination pending a decision on our appeal. While we believe we will prevail and that Toysrus.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcomes of this litigation are uncertain and possible effects of
 
termination are not reflected in the guidance above. If we do not prevail, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for the year, including by as much as $25 million for the second quarter.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. The employer portion of payroll tax expense is included in both presentations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
As previously reported, we are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our Toysrus.com contract. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court has denied our motion to stay the termination pending a decision on our appeal.
While we believe we will prevail on the appeal and that Toysrus.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcome of this litigation are uncertain and the possible effects of termination were not reflected in our financial guidance contained in our April 25, 2006 press release. As indicated in that release, since we did not prevail on our stay motion, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for 2006 and $25 million for the second quarter 2006, much of which is due to Toysrus.com's failure to pay fees for the second quarter.

ITEM 5.05. AMENDMENTS TO THE REGISTRANT'S CODE OF ETHICS, OR WAIVER OF A PROVISION OF THE CODE OF ETHICS.
On July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Amazon.com, Inc. (the "Company") amended the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"). The amendments revise the complaint reporting provisions of the Code to allow for separate reporting guidelines where necessary to comply with the laws of other countries.
A copy of the amended Code is attached as Exhibit 14.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Dated: July 21, 2006

Exhibit 14.1
Amazon.com employees should always act lawfully, ethically, and in the best interests of Amazon.com. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Conduct") sets out basic guiding principles. Employees who are unsure whether their conduct or the conduct of their coworkers complies with the Code of Conduct should contact their manager or the Legal Department. Employees may also report any suspected noncompliance as provided in the Legal Department's reporting guidelines referred to in paragraph IX below.
I. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
Employees must follow applicable laws, rules and regulations at all times. Employees with questions about the applicability or interpretation of any law, rule or regulation, should contact the .
Legal Department
II. Conflicts of Interest
Employees are expected to use their judgment to act, at all times and in all ways, in the best interests of Amazon.com. A "conflict of interest" exists when an employee's personal interest interferes with the best interests of Amazon.com. For example, a conflict of interest may occur when an employee or a family member receives a personal benefit as a result of the employee's position with Amazon.com. A conflict of interest may also arise from an employee's business or personal relationship with a customer, supplier, competitor, business partner, or other employee, if that relationship impairs the employee's objective business judgment.
Because an employee's receipt of gifts or services could create a conflict of interest, the Legal Department will develop and maintain for disclosure of gifts or services received from customers, suppliers, competitors or business partners.
guidelines
Employees should attempt to avoid conflicts of interest and employees who believe a conflict of interest may exist should promptly notify the Legal Department. The Legal Department will consider the facts and circumstances of the situation to decide whether corrective or mitigating action is appropriate.
 
III. Insider Trading Policy
Federal and state laws prohibit trading in securities by persons who have material information that is not generally known or available to the public.
Employees of the Company may not a) trade in stock or other securities while in possession of material nonpublic information or b) pass on material nonpublic information to others without express authorization by the Company or recommend to others that they trade in stock or other securities based on material nonpublic information.
The Company has adopted guidelines designed to implement this policy. All employees are expected to review and follow the Certain employees must comply with trading windows and/or preclearance requirements when they trade Amazon.com securities.
Amazon.com Insider Trading Guidelines.
IV. Discrimination and Harassment
Amazon.com provides equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind. For more information, see the Amazon.com policies on and in the Amazon.com Owner's Manual.

Workplace Harassment
V. Health and Safety
Amazon.com provides a clean, safe and healthy work environment. Each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe conditions, procedures, or behaviors.
Violence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees must report to work in a condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.
 
VI. Price Fixing
Employees may not discuss prices or make any formal or informal agreement with any competitor regarding prices, discounts, business terms, or the market segments and channels in which the Company competes, where the purpose or result of such discussion or agreement would be inconsistent with applicable antitrust laws. If you have any questions about this section or the applicable antitrust laws, please contact the Legal Department.
VII. Payments to Government Personnel
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business. Employees may not make illegal payments to government officials. Employees who are conducting business with the government officials of any country must contact the Legal Department for on the law governing payments and gifts to governmental officials.
guidance
VIII. Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Financial Integrity
Amazon.com's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in appropriate detail, must properly reflect the Company's transactions and must conform both to applicable law and to the Company's system of internal controls. Further, Amazon.com's public financial reports must contain full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure as required by law. The Company's financial, accounting and legal groups are responsible for procedures designed to assure proper internal and disclosure controls, and all employees should cooperate with these procedures.
IX. Questions; Reporting Violations
Employees should speak with anyone in their management chain or the Legal Department when they have a question about the application of the Code of Conduct or when in doubt about how to properly act in a particular situation.
The Amazon.com Legal Department has developed and maintains reporting guidelines for employees who wish to report violations of the Code of Conduct. These guidelines include information on making reports to the Legal Department and to an independent third party. Please see the reporting guidelines for information and instructions.
 
Amazon.com will not allow retaliation against an employee for reporting misconduct by others in good faith. Employees must cooperate in internal investigations of potential or alleged misconduct.
Employees who violate the Code of Conduct will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
X. Periodic Certification
The Legal Department will designate certain employees who, based on their level of responsibility or the nature of their work, will be required to certify periodically that they have read, understand and complied with the Code of Conduct.
XI. Board of Directors
With respect to their service on behalf of the Company, Amazon.com's Board of Directors must comply with the relevant provisions of this Code of Conduct, including conflicts of interest, insider trading and compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
XII. Waivers
Waivers of this Code of Conduct may be made only in a manner permitted by law.

Exhibit 99.1
AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES 22% SALES GROWTH FUELED BY LOWER PRICES, FREE SHIPPING; AMAZON PRIME MEMBERSHIPS MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM YEAR END; RAISES TOP LINE AND LOWERS BOTTOM LINE GUIDANCE; WILL INVEST HEAVILY IN TOY CATEGORY IN BACK HALF OF YEAR
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)July 25, 2006Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Operating cash flow declined 2% to $610 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $624 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2005. Free cash flow decreased 23% to $375 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $486 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2005. The primary driver of the free cash flow decline was our increased expenditure in technology and content. Free cash flow was also reduced by a $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005, $34 million from excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows, and investments in additional fulfillment capacity.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 443 million at June 30, 2006, compared with 438 million a year ago.
Net sales increased 22% to $2.14 billion in the second quarter, compared with $1.75 billion in second quarter 2005. Excluding the $24 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 23% compared with second quarter 2005.
Operating income decreased 55% to $47 million in the second quarter, compared with $104 million in second quarter 2005. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments, lower prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime, and $20 million from a contract termination and related fee dispute.
Net income was $22 million in the second quarter, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $52 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in second quarter 2005.
"We're investing in Amazon Prime and future technology initiatives" said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "Amazon Prime gets customers their products fast, and our investments in technology position us to innovate in seller platforms, web services, and digital. We're looking forward to the coming decrease in our year-over-year growth rates in technology spending in the second half of 2006."
Amazon Prime, Amazon.com's first-ever membership program, was introduced in February 2005. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited, express two-day shipping for free, with no minimum purchase requirement on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com. Members can order as late as 6:30 p.m. ET and still get their order the next day for only $3.99 per item, and they can share the benefits of Amazon Prime with up to four family members living in their household. Sign up for Amazon Prime at www.amazon.com/prime.

Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.

In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment", "Technology and content", "Marketing", and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.

Exhibit 99.1
AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS; NET SALES UP 24% YEAR OVER YEAR; EXPECTS RECORD HOLIDAY SEASON
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)October 24, 2006Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2006.
Operating cash flow declined 11% to $587 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $661 million for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2005. Free cash flow decreased 23% to $366 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $475 million for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2005, driven primarily by our increased expenditure in technology and content.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 435 million at September 30, 2006, compared with 438 million a year ago. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 8 million shares, or $252 million under its previously announced authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock.
Net sales increased 24% to $2.31 billion in the third quarter, compared with $1.86 billion in third quarter 2005. Excluding the $20 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 23% compared with third quarter 2005.
Operating income decreased 28% to $40 million in the third quarter, compared with $55 million in third quarter 2005. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments. Third quarter 2005 operating income included a negative impact of $40 million relating to a patent litigation settlement.
Net income was $19 million in the third quarter, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $30 million, or $0.07 per diluted share in third quarter 2005.
"We're pleased with the strong revenue growth and rapid adoption of Amazon Prime," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "We look forward to seeing significant sequential improvement in operating leverage this Q4, even as we continue to invest in many initiatives including new retail categories, seller platforms, web services, and digital."
Amazon Prime continues to demonstrate strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new memberships. Amazon Prime, Amazon.com's first-ever membership program, was introduced in February 2005. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited, express two-day shipping for free, with no minimum purchase requirement on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant indebtedness, system interruptions, consumer trends, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud, and new business areas.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. The employer portion of payroll tax expense is included in both presentations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment", "Technology and content", "Marketing", and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
To our shareholders:
At Amazon's current scale, planting seeds that will grow into meaningful new businesses takes some discipline, a bit of patience, and a nurturing culture.
Our established businesses are well-rooted young trees. They are growing, enjoy high returns on capital, and operate in very large market segments. These characteristics set a high bar for any new business we would start. Before we invest our shareholders' money in a new business, we must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon. And we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company.
Furthermore, we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved and that we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace. Without that, it's unlikely we'd get to scale in that new business.
I often get asked, "When are you going to open physical stores?" That's an expansion opportunity we've resisted. It fails all but one of the tests outlined above. The potential size of a network of physical stores is exciting. However: we don't know how to do it with low capital and high returns; physical-world retailing is a cagey and ancient business that's already well served; and we don't have any ideas for how to build a physical world store experience that's meaningfully differentiated for customers.
When you do see us enter new businesses, it's because we believe the above tests have been passed. Our acquisition of Joyo.com is a first step in serving the most populous country in the world. E-commerce in China is still in its early days, and we believe it's an excellent business opportunity. Shoes, apparel, groceries: these are big segments where we have the right skills to invent and grow large-scale, high-return businesses that genuinely improve customer experience.
Fulfillment by Amazon is a set of web services API's that turns our 12 million square foot fulfillment center network into a gigantic and sophisticated computer peripheral. Pay us 45 cents per month per cubic foot of fulfillment center space, and you can stow your products in our network. You make web services calls to alert us to expect inventory to arrive, to tell us to pick and pack one or more items, and to tell us where to ship those items. You never have to talk to us. It's differentiated, can be large, and passes our returns bar.
Amazon Web Services is another example. With AWS, we're building a new business focused on a new customer set  software developers. We currently offer ten different web services and have built a community of over 240,000 registered developers. We're targeting broad needs universally faced by developers, such as storage and compute capacityareas in which developers have asked for help, and in which we have deep expertise from scaling Amazon.com over the last twelve years. We're well positioned to do it, it's highly differentiated, and it can be a significant, financially attractive business over time.
In some large companies, it might be difficult to grow new businesses from tiny seeds because of the patience and nurturing required. In my view, Amazon's culture is unusually supportive of small businesses with big potential, and I believe that's a source of competitive advantage.
Like any company, we have a corporate culture formed not only by our intentions but also as a result of our history. For Amazon, that history is fairly fresh and, fortunately, it includes several examples of tiny seeds growing into big trees. We have many people at our company who have watched multiple $10 million seeds turn into billion dollar businesses. That first-hand experience and the culture that has grown up around those
successes is, in my opinion, a big part of why we can start businesses from scratch. The culture demands that these new businesses be high potential and that they be innovative and differentiated, but it does not demand that they be large on the day that they are born.
I remember how excited we were in 1996 as we crossed $10 million in book sales. It wasn't hard to be excitedwe had grown to $10 million from zero. Today, when a new business inside Amazon grows to $10 million, the overall company is growing from $10 billion to $10.01 billion. It would be easy for the senior executives who run our established billion dollar businesses to scoff. But they don't. They watch the growth rates of the emerging businesses and send emails of congratulations. That's pretty cool, and we're proud it's a part of our culture.
In our experience, if a new business enjoys runaway success, it can only to be meaningful to the overall company economics in something like three to seven years. We've seen those time frames with our international businesses, our earlier non-media businesses, and our third party seller businesses. Today, international is 45% of sales, non-media is 34% of sales, and our third party seller businesses account for 28% of our units sold. We will be happy indeed if some of the new seeds we're planting enjoy similar successes.
begin
We've come a distance since we celebrated our first $10 million in sales. As we continue to grow, we'll work to maintain a culture that embraces new businesses. We will do so in a disciplined way, with an eye on returns, potential size, and the ability to create differentiation that customers care about. We won't always choose right, and we won't always succeed. But we will be choosy, and we will work hard and patiently.
As always, I attach our 1997 letter to shareholders. You'll see that our philosophy and approach have not changed. Many thanks for your support and encouragement.

Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Amazon.com, Inc.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 24, 2007. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.
Third Quarter 2007 Guidance
 
 
Full Year 2007 Expectations
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, significant indebtedness, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and all subsequent filings

The procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5.1 for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provision.

2.6.1 Waiver in Writing
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as now or hereafter amended (the "DGCL"), a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.
2.6.2 Waiver by Attendance
The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
2.7 Fixing of Record Date for Determining Stockholders
2.7.1 Meetings

The person in whose name shares stand on the books of the corporation shall be deemed by the corporation to be the owner thereof for all purposes.
6.4 Restriction on Transfer
Except to the extent that the corporation has obtained an opinion of counsel acceptable to the corporation that transfer restrictions are not required under applicable securities laws, or has otherwise satisfied itself that such transfer restrictions are not required, all certificates representing shares of the corporation shall bear a legend on the face of the certificate, or on the reverse of the certificate if a reference to the legend is contained on the face, that reads substantially as follows:
"The securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law, and no interest therein may be sold, distributed, assigned, offered, pledged or otherwise transferred unless (a) there is an effective registration statement under such Act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction involving said securities or (b) this corporation receives an opinion of legal counsel for the holder of these securities (concurred in by legal counsel for this corporation) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or this corporation otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. Neither the offering of the securities nor any offering materials have been reviewed by any administrator under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law."
 
If any securities of the corporation are issued pursuant to Regulation S ("Regulation S") of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), the corporation will refuse to register any subsequent transfer of such securities if such transfer is not made in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the 1933 Act or pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the 1933 Act.
6.5 Transfer of Shares
The transfer of shares of the corporation shall be made only on the stock transfer books of the corporation pursuant to authorization or document of transfer made by the holder of record thereof or by his or her legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney-in-fact authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificate, if any, shall be issued until the former certificates, if any, for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled.
6.6 Lost or Destroyed Certificates
In the case of a lost, destroyed or mutilated certificate, a new certificate may be issued therefor upon such terms and indemnity to the corporation as the Board may prescribe.

Shares owned by the corporation in another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Board may determine or, in the absence of such determination, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President of the corporation.
SECTION 7. BOOKS AND RECORDS
The corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account, stock transfer books, minutes of the proceedings of its stockholders and Board and such other records as may be necessary or advisable.
SECTION 8. ACCOUNTING YEAR
The accounting year of the corporation shall be the calendar year, provided that if a different accounting year is at any time selected for purposes of federal income taxes, the accounting year shall be the year so selected.
SECTION 9. SEAL
The seal of the corporation, if any, shall consist of the name of the corporation, the state of its incorporation and the year of its incorporation.
 
SECTION 10. INDEMNIFICATION
10.1 Right to Indemnification
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a Director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as such a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection 10.2 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this subsection 10.1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this subsection 10.1 or otherwise.
10.2 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
If a claim under subsection 10.1 hereof is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid
 
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
10.3 Nonexclusivity of Rights
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Section 10, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
10.4 Insurance, Contracts and Funding
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The corporation, without further stockholder approval, may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, employee or agent in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 10 and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section 10.
10.5 Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
The corporation may, by action of the Board, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees or agents or groups of employees or agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Section 10 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the corporation; provided, however, that an undertaking shall be made by an employee or agent only if required by the Board.
 
10.6 Persons Serving Other Entities
Any person who is or was a Director or officer of the corporation who is or was serving (a) as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its Directors is held by the corporation or (b) in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under subsection 10.1 hereof.
10.7 Procedures for the Submission of Claims
The Board may establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these Bylaws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENTS OR REPEAL
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation; provided, however, the Board of Directors may not repeal or amend any bylaw that the stockholders have expressly provided may not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation.
Notwithstanding any amendment to Section 10 hereof or repeal of these Bylaws, or of any amendment or repeal of any of the procedures that may be established by the Board pursuant to Section 10 hereof, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
The foregoing Amended and Restated Bylaws were adopted by the Board of Directors on September 12, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER SALES UP 41% YEAR OVER YEAR; RAISES FINANCIAL GUIDANCE; EXPECTS RECORD HOLIDAY SEASON
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)October 23, 2007Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2007.
Operating cash flow was $1.0 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $587 million for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2006.

Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 435 million on September 30, 2007, unchanged from a year ago.
Net sales increased 41% to $3.26 billion in the third quarter, compared with $2.31 billion in third quarter 2006. Excluding the $75 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 38% compared with third quarter 2006.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of October 23, 2007. Results may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, and the various factors detailed below.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, significant indebtedness, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and all subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

ITEM 2.03.  CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On December 21, 2007, the Company entered into agreements with entities associated with City Investors LLC and Schnitzer West LLC for the lease of corporate office space to be developed in Seattle, Washington, subject to customary real estate lease conditions. Upon completion of development in 2010 and 2011, the Company will commence leases with initial terms of up to 16 years to consolidate its corporate headquarters to a single location and help support the Company's long term growth and space requirements. Under the agreements the Company will occupy approximately 800,000 square feet of office space for approximately $700 million, which includes rent, operating expenses and tenant improvements, to be paid over the initial terms. The Company also has the right to occupy up to an additional approximately 800,000 square feet for up to approximately $800 million to be paid over the initial terms, subject to a termination fee of up to approximately $40 million if the Company elects not to occupy the additional space. In addition, the Company has options for additional space, subject to certain conditions. The amount of space available and the Company's financial and other obligations under the agreements are affected byvarious factors, including government approvals and permits, interest rates, development costs and other expenses and the Company's exercise of certain rights under the agreements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 3.1
Originally adopted on February 7, 2008
Amendments are listed on p. i
 
 
 
 
 
 
SECTION 1. OFFICES
The principal office of the corporation shall be located at its principal place of business or such other place as the Board of Directors (the "Board") may designate. The corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the state of Delaware, as the Board may designate or as the business of the corporation may require from time to time.
SECTION 2. STOCKHOLDERS
 
The annual meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of electing Directors and transacting such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at such place, date and hour as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board.
 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Board may call special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be held if the holders of not less than 30% of all of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at such meeting have dated, signed and delivered to the Secretary one or more written demands for such meeting, describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held. Any special meeting so demanded shall be held at such place, date and time as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board, provided such special meeting shall be held not later than the 90
th
day after receipt by the Secretary of the requisite demand or demands for such meeting.
 
All meetings shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place within or without the State of Delaware designated by the Board, by any persons entitled to call a meeting hereunder or in a waiver of notice signed by all of the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, or the Board shall cause to be delivered to each stockholder entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting either personally or by mail, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
 
meeting, written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Upon written request by the holders of not less than the number of outstanding shares of the corporation specified in subsection 2.2 hereof and entitled to vote at the meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to give notice of a special meeting of stockholders not less than 10 nor more than 60 days after receipt of said request, and if the Secretary shall neglect or refuse to issue such notice, the person making the request may do so and may fix the date for such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation with postage prepaid. If the notice is telegraphed, it shall be deemed delivered when the content of the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. Notice given in any other manner shall be deemed delivered when dispatched to the stockholder's address, telephone number or other number appearing on the stock transfer records of the corporation.
 
 
In addition to the election of directors, other proper business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, provided that such business must be properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) brought by or at the direction of the Board or (b) brought before the meeting by a stockholder pursuant to written notice thereof, in accordance with subsection 2.5.3 hereof, and received by the Secretary not later than the close of business on the 60
th
day and not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, such notice must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which the notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made). No business shall be conducted at any annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this subsection 2.5.1, unless the application of this subsection 2.5.1 to a particular matter is waived in writing by the Board of Directors. If the facts warrant, the Board, or the chairman of an annual meeting of stockholders, may determine and declare that (a) a proposal does not constitute proper business to be transacted at the meeting or (b) business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 2.5.1 and, if, it is so determined in either case, any such business shall not be transacted. The procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5.1 for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provision.
 
At any special meeting of the stockholders, only such business as is specified in the notice of such special meeting given by or at the direction of the person or persons calling such meeting, in accordance with subsection 2.4 hereof, shall come before such meeting.
 
Any written notice required to be delivered by a stockholder to the corporation pursuant to subsection 2.2, subsection 2.4, subsection 2.5.1 or subsection 2.5.2 hereof must be given, either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary at the corporation's executive offices. Any such stockholder notice shall set forth (i) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business; (ii) a representation that the stockholder is entitled to vote at such meeting and a statement of the number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (iii) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; and (iv) as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, the language of the proposal (if appropriate), and any material interest of the stockholder in such business.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as now or hereafter amended (the "DGCL"), a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.
 
The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 (or the maximum
 
number permitted by applicable law) nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by Chapter 1 of the DGCL, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by Chapter 1 of the DGCL, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
At least 10 days before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, shall be made,
 
arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and number of shares held by each stockholder. This list shall be open to examination by any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. This list shall also be produced and kept at such meeting for inspection by any stockholder who is present.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the stockholders; provided, that where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. If a quorum is present or represented at a reconvened meeting following such an adjournment, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
In all matters other than the election of Directors, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, if a quorum of such class or classes is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of outstanding shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Directors shall be elected as set forth in Section 3.3.2 of these Bylaws.
 
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such authorization may be accomplished by (a) the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent executing a writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any
 
reasonable means, including facsimile signature or (b) by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the intended holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service or similar agent duly authorized by the intended proxy holder to receive such transmission; provided, that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission by which a stockholder has authorized another person to act as proxy for such stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
A proxy shall be filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting or the delivery to the corporation of the consent to corporate action in writing. A proxy shall become invalid three years after the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy with respect to a specified meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any reconvened meeting following adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.
 
Each outstanding share entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter of an issue submitted to a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote upon each such issue.
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at an election of Directors may vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such stockholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election such stockholder has a right to vote; provided, however, that no cumulative voting shall be permitted in the election of Directors.
 
Subject to the following paragraph, any action that is properly brought before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and that could be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall (a) be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted with respect to the subject matter thereof having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted (as determined in accordance with subsection 2.6.2 hereof) and (b) be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
 
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the records of proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless written consents signed by the requisite number of stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof are delivered to the corporation, in the manner required by this Section 2, within 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation in the manner required by this Section 2. The validity of any consent executed by a proxy for a stockholder pursuant to a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission transmitted to such proxy holder by or upon the authorization of the stockholder shall be determined by or at the direction of the Secretary. A written record of the information upon which the person making such determination relied shall be made and kept in the records of the proceedings of the stockholders. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any such consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes of a meeting of the stockholders.
 
 
In advance of any meeting of stockholders after this corporation has become a Public Company (as defined below), the Board shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of election at such meeting and to make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons to serve as alternate inspectors to serve in place of any inspector who is unable or fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of such meeting shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspector of elections at such meeting. This corporation shall be a "Public Company" upon the earliest of (a) a vote by the Board of Directors of the corporation designating the corporation a Public Company, (b) when a registration statement filed by the corporation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with an offering of the corporation's securities to the public first becomes effective or (c) upon the effective date of the registration of the corporation's securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
The inspectors of election shall:
(a) ascertain the number of shares of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share;
 
(b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots;
(c) count all votes and ballots;
(d) determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by them; and
(e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of the votes and ballots.
The validity of any proxy or ballot shall be determined by the inspectors of election in accordance with the applicable provisions of these Bylaws and the DGCL as then in effect. In determining the validity of any proxy transmitted by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission, the inspectors shall record in writing the information upon which they relied in making such determination. Each inspector of elections shall, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors of election may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist them in the performance of their duties.
SECTION 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by the Board.
 
The number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
No decrease in the number of Directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director. Each Director shall serve for the term he or she was elected, or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. Directors need not be stockholders of the corporation or residents of the State of Delaware.
 
 
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations for the election of Directors may be made (a) by or at the direction of the Board or (b) by any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of Directors at such meeting; provided, however, that a stockholder may
 
nominate persons for election as Directors only if written notice (in accordance with subsection 2.5.3 hereof) of such stockholder's intention to make such nominations is received by the Secretary not later than (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, not later than the close of business on the 60
th
day and not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, such notice must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made) and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors, the close of business on the seventh business day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to stockholders. Any such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make a nomination; (b) a representation that the stockholder is entitled to vote at such meeting and a statement of the number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (c) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (d) as to each person the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, the name and address of such person and, if the corporation is then a Public Company, such other information regarding such nominee as would be required in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had such nominee been nominated by the Board, and a description of any arrangements or understandings, between the stockholder and such nominee and any other persons (including their names), pursuant to which the nomination is to be made; (e) the consent of each such nominee to serve as a Director if elected; and (f) a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any future meeting at which such person would face re-election and acceptance of such resignation by the Board, in accordance with the corporation's Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues.
If the facts warrant, the Board, or the chairman of a stockholders' meeting at which Directors are to be elected, may determine and declare that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure and, if it is so determined, the defective nomination shall be disregarded. The procedures set forth in this subsection 3.3 for nomination for the election of Directors by stockholders are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any procedures now in effect or hereafter adopted by or at the direction of the Board or any committee thereof.
 
A nominee for Director shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has
 
nominated a person for election to the Board in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for Director set forth in Section 3.3.1 of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the seventh day before the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If Directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
 
An annual Board meeting shall be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of stockholders. By resolution, the Board or any committee designated by the Board may specify the time and place either within or without the State of Delaware for holding regular meetings thereof without other notice than such resolution.
 
Special meetings of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or, in the case of special Board meetings, any Director, and, in the case of any special meeting of any committee appointed by the Board, by the Chairman thereof. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings may fix any place either within or without the State of Delaware as the place for holding any special meeting called by them.
 
Members of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.
 
Notice of a special Board or committee meeting stating the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be given to a Director as set forth in this Section 3.7. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting need be specified in the notice of such meeting.
 
If notice is given by personal delivery, the notice shall be effective if delivered to a Director at least twenty-four hours before the meeting.
 
If notice is delivered by mail, the notice shall be deemed effective if deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation with postage prepaid at least five days before the meeting.
 
If notice is given by private carrier, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation at least three days before the meeting.
 
If notice is delivered by wire or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched at least twenty-four hours before the meeting to a Director at his or her telephone number or other number shown on the records of the corporation.
 
If notice is delivered by telegraph, the notice shall be deemed effective if the content thereof is delivered to the telegraph company at least twenty-four hours before the meeting for delivery to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation.
 
If notice is delivered by electronic transmission, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched at least twenty-four hours before the meeting to a Director at his or her electronic transmission address shown on the records of the corporation.
 
If notice is delivered orally, by telephone or in person, the notice shall be deemed effective if personally given to the Director at least twenty-four hours before the meeting.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting.
 
The attendance of a Director at a Board or committee meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
A majority of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws or, if vacancies exist on the Board, a majority of the total number of Directors then serving on the Board, provided, however, that such number may be not less than one-third of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any Board meeting. If less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
 
The act of the majority of the Directors present at a Board or committee meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board or committee, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL.
 
A Director of the corporation present at a Board or committee meeting at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or unless such Director files a written dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or forwards such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. A Director who voted in favor of such action may not dissent.
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee of the Board may be taken without a meeting if all of the members of the Board or of the committee of the Board, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission as provided in the DGCL and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
 
Any Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board, or to the registered office of the corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
At a meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose, or without a meeting pursuant to Section 2.14 of these Bylaws, one or more members of the Board (including the entire Board) may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of not less than a majority of the shares entitled to elect the Director or Directors whose removal is sought in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
 
Any vacancy occurring on the Board may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors, whether or not they constitute a quorum of the Board. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected until the next election of Directors or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next election of Directors, and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualify.
 
 
The Board may, pursuant to the authority granted in subsection (2) of section 141(c) of the DGCL, designate one or more standing or temporary committees, each committee to consist of one or more Directors of the corporation. The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board establishing such committee or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to (a) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (b) adopting, amending or repealing any Bylaw of the corporation.
 
All committees so appointed shall keep regular minutes of their meetings and shall cause them to be recorded in books kept for that purpose.
 
A majority of the number of Directors composing any committee of the Board, as established and fixed by resolution of the Board, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of such committee but, if less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of such Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. The act of a majority of the members of a committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee.
 
Any member of any committee may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, the Board or the Chairman of such committee. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
The Board may remove from office any member of any committee elected or appointed by it.
 
By Board resolution, Directors and committee members may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each Board or committee meeting, a fixed sum for attendance at each Board or committee meeting, or a stated salary as Director or a committee member, or a combination of the foregoing. No such payment shall preclude any Director or committee member from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
SECTION 4. OFFICERS
 
The officers of the corporation shall be a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer, each of whom shall be elected by the Board. One or more Vice

Any officer may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice President, the Secretary or the Board. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the Board may be removed by the Board, and any officer appointed by an officer upon whom the power of appointment has been conferred by the Board of Directors may be removed by any such officer or by the Board, whenever in the judgment of the Board or of such officer, as the case may be, the best interests of the corporation would be served thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.
 
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification, creation of a new office or any other cause may be filled by the Board for the unexpired portion of the term, or for a new term established by the Board.
 
If elected, the Chairman of the Board shall perform such duties as shall be assigned to him or her by the Board from time to time and shall preside over meetings of the Board and stockholders unless another officer is appointed or designated by the Board as chairman of such meeting.

In the event of the death of the Chief Executive Officer or his inability to act, the President shall perform the duties of the Chief Executive Officer, except as may be limited by resolution of the Board, with all the powers of and subject to all the restrictions upon the Chief Executive Officer. The President may sign with the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary certificates for shares of the corporation. The President shall have, to the extent authorized by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board, the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer to sign deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts or other instruments. The President shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him or her by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board.
 
In the event of the death of the President or his or her inability to act, the Vice President (or if there is more than one Vice President, the Vice President who was designated by the Board as the successor to the President, or if no Vice President is so designated, the Vice President first elected to such office) shall perform the duties of the President, except as may be limited by resolution of the Board, with all the powers of and subject to all the restrictions upon the President.

The salaries of the officers shall be fixed from time to time by the Board or by any person or persons to whom the Board has delegated such authority. No officer shall be prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she is also a Director of the corporation.
SECTION 5. CONTRACTS, LOANS, CHECKS AND DEPOSITS

All funds of the corporation not otherwise employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board may select.
SECTION 6. CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER
 
No shares of the corporation shall be issued unless authorized by the Board, which authorization shall include the maximum number of shares to be issued and the consideration to be received for each share.
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board may provide by resolution that some or all of any classes or series of the corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Each holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board, President, or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, any of whose signatures may be a facsimile. The Board may in its discretion appoint responsible banks, trust companies or other professionals from time to time to act as transfer agents and registrars of the stock of the corporation; and, when such appointments shall have been made, no stock certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of such transfer agents and registered by one of such registrars. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person was such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. All certificates shall include on their face written notice of any restrictions that may be imposed on the transferability of such shares and shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified.
 
The stock transfer books shall be kept at the registered office or principal place of business of the corporation or at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar. The name and address of each person to whom shares are issued, together with the class and number of such shares and the date of issue thereof, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. The person in whose name shares stand on the books of the corporation shall be deemed by the corporation to be the owner thereof for all purposes.
 
Except to the extent that the corporation has obtained an opinion of counsel acceptable to the corporation that transfer restrictions are not required under applicable
 
securities laws, or has otherwise satisfied itself that such transfer restrictions are not required, all certificates representing shares of the corporation shall bear a legend on the face of the certificate, or on the reverse of the certificate if a reference to the legend is contained on the face, that reads substantially as follows:
"The securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law, and no interest therein may be sold, distributed, assigned, offered, pledged or otherwise transferred unless (a) there is an effective registration statement under such Act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction involving said securities or (b) this corporation receives an opinion of legal counsel for the holder of these securities (concurred in by legal counsel for this corporation) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or this corporation otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. Neither the offering of the securities nor any offering materials have been reviewed by any administrator under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law."
If any securities of the corporation are issued pursuant to Regulation S ("Regulation S") of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), the corporation will refuse to register any subsequent transfer of such securities if such transfer is not made in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the 1933 Act or pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the 1933 Act.
 
The transfer of shares of the corporation shall be made only on the stock transfer books of the corporation pursuant to authorization or document of transfer made by the holder of record thereof or by his or her legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney-in-fact authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificate, if any, shall be issued until the former certificates, if any, for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled.
 
In the case of a lost, destroyed or mutilated certificate, a new certificate may be issued therefor upon such terms and indemnity to the corporation as the Board may prescribe.
 
Shares owned by the corporation in another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Board may determine or, in the absence of such determination, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President of the corporation.
 
SECTION 7. BOOKS AND RECORDS
The corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account, stock transfer books, minutes of the proceedings of its stockholders and Board and such other records as may be necessary or advisable.
SECTION 8. ACCOUNTING YEAR
The accounting year of the corporation shall be the calendar year, provided that if a different accounting year is at any time selected for purposes of federal income taxes, the accounting year shall be the year so selected.
SECTION 9. SEAL
The seal of the corporation, if any, shall consist of the name of the corporation, the state of its incorporation and the year of its incorporation.
SECTION 10. INDEMNIFICATION
 
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a Director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as such a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection 10.2 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this subsection 10.1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses
 
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this subsection 10.1 or otherwise.
 
If a claim under subsection 10.1 hereof is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Section 10, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership,
 
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The corporation, without further stockholder approval, may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, employee or agent in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 10 and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section 10.
 
The corporation may, by action of the Board, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees or agents or groups of employees or agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Section 10 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the corporation; provided, however, that an undertaking shall be made by an employee or agent only if required by the Board.
 
Any person who is or was a Director or officer of the corporation who is or was serving (a) as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its Directors is held by the corporation or (b) in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under subsection 10.1 hereof.
 
The Board may establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these Bylaws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENTS OR REPEAL
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation; provided, however, the Board of Directors may not repeal or amend any bylaw that the stockholders have expressly provided may not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation.
 
Notwithstanding any amendment to Section 10 hereof or repeal of these Bylaws, or of any amendment or repeal of any of the procedures that may be established by the Board pursuant to Section 10 hereof, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
The foregoing Amended and Restated Bylaws were adopted by the Board of Directors on February 7, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
To our shareowners:
 
November 19, 2007, was a special day. After three years of work, we introduced Amazon Kindle to our customers.
 
Many of you may already know something of Kindlewe're fortunate (and grateful) that it has been broadly written and talked about. Briefly, Kindle is a purpose-built reading device with wireless access to more than 110,000 books, blogs, magazines, and newspapers. The wireless connectivity isn't WiFiinstead it uses the same wireless network as advanced cell phones, which means it works when you're at home in bed or out and moving around. You can buy a book directly from the device, and the whole book will be downloaded wirelessly, ready for reading, in less than 60 seconds. There is no "wireless plan," no year-long contract you must commit to, and no monthly service fee. It has a paper-like electronic-ink display that's easy to read even in bright daylight. Folks who see the display for the first time do a double-take. It's thinner and lighter than a paperback, and can hold 200 books. Take a look at the Kindle detail page on Amazon.com to see what customers thinkKindle has already been reviewed more than 2,000 times.
 
As you might expect after three years of work, we had sincere hopes that Kindle would be well received, but we did not expect the level of demand that actually materialized. We sold out in the first 5

/
2
hours, and our supply chain and manufacturing teams have had to scramble to increase production capacity.
 
We started by setting ourselves the admittedly audacious goal of improving upon the physical book. We did not choose that goal lightly. Anything that has persisted in roughly the same form and resisted change for 500 years is unlikely to be improved easily. At the beginning of our design process, we identified what we believe is the book's most important feature. It . When you read a book, you don't notice the paper and the ink and the glue and the stitching. All of that dissolves, and what remains is the author's world.
disappears
 
We knew Kindle would have to , just like a physical book, so readers could become engrossed in the words and forget they're reading on a device. We also knew we shouldn't try to copy every last feature of a bookwe could never out-book the book. We'd have to add capabilitiesones that could never be possible with a traditional book.
get out of the way
new
 
The early days of Amazon.com provide an analog. It was tempting back then to believe that an online bookstore should have all the features of a physical bookstore. I was asked about a particular feature dozens of times: "How are you going to do electronic book signings?" Thirteen years later, we still haven't figured that one out! Instead of trying to duplicate physical bookstores, we've been inspired by them and worked to find things we could do in the new medium that could never be done in the old one. We don't have electronic book signings, and similarly we can't provide a comfortable spot to sip coffee and relax. However, we can offer literally of titles, help with purchase decisions through customer reviews, and provide discovery features like "customers who bought this item also bought." The list of useful things that can be done only in the new medium is a long one.
millions
 
I'll highlight a few of the useful features we built into Kindle that go beyond what you could ever do with a physical book. If you come across a word you don't recognize, you can look it up easily. You can search your books. Your margin notes and underlinings are stored on the server-side in the "cloud," where they can't be lost. Kindle keeps your place in each of the books you're reading, automatically. If your eyes are tired, you can change the font size. Most important is the seamless, simple ability to find a book and have it in 60 seconds. When I've watched people do this for the first time, it's clear the capability has a profound effect on them. Our vision for Kindle is every book ever printed in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds.
Publishersincluding all the major publishershave embraced Kindle, and we're thankful for that. From a publisher's point of view, there are a lot of advantages to Kindle. Books never go out of print, and they never go out of stock. Nor is there ever waste from over-printing. Most important, Kindle makes it more convenient for readers to buy more books. Anytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it.
 
We humans co-evolve with our tools. We change our tools, and then our tools change us. Writing, invented thousands of years ago, is a grand whopper of a tool, and I have no doubt that it changed us dramatically. Five hundred years ago, Gutenberg's invention led to a significant step-change in the cost of books. Physical books ushered in a new way of collaborating and learning. Lately, networked tools such as desktop computers, laptops, cell phones and PDAs have changed us too. They've shifted us more toward and I would argue toward shorter attention spans. I value my BlackBerryI'm convinced it makes me more productivebut I don't want to read a three-hundred-page document on it. Nor do I want to read something hundreds of pages long on my desktop computer or my laptop. As I've already mentioned in this letter, people do more of what's convenient and friction-free. If our tools make information snacking easier, we'll shift more toward information snacking and away from long-form reading. Kindle is purpose-built for long-form reading. We hope Kindle and its successors may gradually and incrementally move us over years into a world with longer spans of attention, providing a counterbalance to the recent proliferation of info-snacking tools. I realize my tone here tends toward the missionary, and I can assure you it's heartfelt. It's also not unique to me but is shared by a large group of folks here. I'm glad about that because missionaries build better products. I'll also point out that, while I'm convinced books are on the verge of being improved upon, Amazon has no sinecure as that agent. It will happen, but if we don't execute well, it will be done by others.
information snacking,
 
Your team of missionaries here is fervent about driving free cash flow per share and returns on capital. We know we can do that by putting customers first. I guarantee you there is more innovation ahead of us than behind us, and we do not expect the road to be an easy one. We're hopeful, and I'd even say optimistic, that Kindle, true to its name, will "start a fire" and improve the world of reading.
 
As always, I attach our 1997 letter to shareholders. You'll see that Kindle exemplifies our philosophy and long-term investment approach as discussed in that letter. Happy reading and many thanks!

April 2008
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 23, 2008.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, significant indebtedness, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 29, 2009. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
 
First Quarter 2009 Guidance
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, indebtedness, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment," "Technology and content," "Marketing," and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The amendments do not change the time frames in which advance notice of director nominations or other business must be given to the Company for annual meetings of stockholders.
The amendments require that stockholders proposing nominations or business for special or annual meetings provide, in addition to information already required by the Bylaws:

Exhibit 3.1
Originally adopted on February 12, 2009
 
 
 
 
SECTION 1. OFFICES
The principal office of the corporation shall be located at its principal place of business or such other place as the Board of Directors (the "Board") may designate. The corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the state of Delaware, as the Board may designate or as the business of the corporation may require from time to time.
SECTION 2. STOCKHOLDERS
 
The annual meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of electing Directors and transacting such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at such place, date and hour as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board.
 
 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Board may call special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose.
 
A special meeting of the stockholders shall be held if the holders of not less than 30% of all of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at such meeting have dated, signed and delivered to the Secretary one or more written demands for such meeting, describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held. Any special meeting so demanded shall be held at such place, date and time as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board, provided such special meeting shall be held not later than the 90
th
day after receipt by the Secretary of the requisite demand or demands for such meeting. Any stockholder proposing to introduce nominations or other business at such meeting (the "Proposing Stockholder") shall submit to the Secretary, at the time such demands are delivered, an affidavit confirming that it will timely provide the written notice required by subsection 2.5.2 hereof with respect to such nominations or other business.
 
All meetings shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place within or without the State of Delaware designated by the Board, by any persons entitled to call a meeting hereunder or in a waiver of notice signed by all of the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
 
Except as otherwise provided by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as now or hereafter amended (the "DGCL"), the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, or the Board shall cause to be delivered to each stockholder entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting either personally or by mail, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting, written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Upon written request by the holders of not less than the number of outstanding shares of the corporation specified in subsection 2.2.2 hereof and entitled to vote at the meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to give notice of a special meeting of stockholders not less than 10 nor more than 60 days after receipt of said request. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation with postage prepaid. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided by Section 232 of the DGCL.
 
 
Nominations for election of Directors and the proposal of other business may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders, provided that such nominations and other business must be properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations and other business must be (a) brought by or at the direction of the Board or (b) brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record entitled to vote on such matter at such meeting who submits a written notice containing the information set forth in subsection 2.5.3 hereof, provided that such notice is received by the Secretary not later than the close of business on the 60
th
day and not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, such notice must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the 90
th
day and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made). For business to be brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (b) of the second sentence of this subsection 2.5.1, any such business must constitute a
 
proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL. In no event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice described in this subsection 2.5.1.
The foregoing notice procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5.1 shall not apply to a stockholder proposal submitted only pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provision.
 
At any special meeting of the stockholders, only such business as is specified in the notice of such special meeting given in accordance with subsection 2.4 hereof shall come before such meeting.
At a special meeting of stockholders at which Directors are to be elected pursuant to the notice of meeting given in accordance with subsection 2.4 hereof, nominations for the election of Directors may be made only (a) by or at the direction of the Board or (b) by any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of Directors at such meeting who submits a written notice containing the information set forth in subsection 2.5.3 hereof, provided that such notice is received by the Secretary at the corporation's executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which public disclosure of the date of such special meeting is first made.
At any special meeting held on the written demand of stockholders pursuant to subsection 2.2.2 hereof, in addition to any nomination of Directors as set forth in and in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, only such other business may be considered as (a) shall be brought before such meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (b) shall be stated in the demand, provided that with respect to this clause (b), (i) any such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL, and (ii) the Proposing Stockholder must be entitled to vote on such matter at such meeting and must submit a written notice containing the information set forth in subsection 2.5.3 hereof, which notice must be received by the Secretary at the corporation's executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which public disclosure of the date of such special meeting is first made.
 
Any written notice required to be delivered by a stockholder to the corporation pursuant to subsection 2.5.1 or subsection 2.5.2 hereof must be given, either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary at the corporation's principal executive offices. Any such stockholder notice shall set forth (a) as to the stockholder giving the notice and each beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), if any, on whose behalf the nomination or other business is being proposed, (i) the name and address of the stockholder and the name and address of the beneficial owner; (ii) a representation that the stockholder
 
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination or other business; and (iii) a statement of the number of shares of the corporation that are owned of record by the stockholder and owned beneficially by each beneficial owner, as of the date of the stockholder's notice, and the stockholder's agreement to notify the corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of the number of such shares owned of record by the stockholder and owned beneficially by each beneficial owner as of such record date; (b) either as to the stockholder giving the notice or as to the beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or other business is being proposed, if the notice is given on behalf of a beneficial owner rather than on behalf of the record holder, (i) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other business between or among such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person, including without limitation any agreements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (regardless of whether a Schedule 13D is required), and the stockholder's agreement to notify the corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of such record date; and (ii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of the corporation's capital stock, or increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, and the stockholder's agreement to notify the corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of such record date; (c) as to each person the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, (i) the name and address of such person and such other information regarding such nominee as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (ii) the consent of each such nominee to serve as a Director if elected; and (iii) a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any future meeting at which such person would face re-election and acceptance of such resignation by the Board, in accordance with the corporation's Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues; (d) as to any other business the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, the language of the proposal (if appropriate), and any substantial interest (within the meaning of Item 5 of Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in such business of the stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the business is being proposed; and (e) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, will engage in a solicitation with respect to such nomination or proposal and, if so, the name of each participant (as defined in
 
Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in such solicitation and whether such person intends or is part of a group which intends to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock reasonably believed by such person to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees for Director or to approve or adopt the business to be proposed in (person or by proxy) by the stockholder. The corporation may require any proposed nominee for director to furnish such other information as the corporation may reasonably request, including such information as would be necessary for the corporation to determine whether the proposed nominee can be considered an independent Director.
 
Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5 shall be eligible to be elected to serve as Directors and only such other business shall be conducted that has been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5. If the facts warrant, the Board, or the Chairman of the Board, may determine and declare that (a) a nomination or other business does not constitute proper business to be transacted at the meeting or (b) a nomination or other business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 2.5. Additionally, unless otherwise required by law, if a stockholder does not provide the information required under subsections 2.5.3, or the stockholder does not appear in person or by proxy at the annual or special meeting to present the nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote have been received by the corporation.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.
 
The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by Chapter 1 of the DGCL, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by Chapter 1 of the DGCL, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law)
 
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
At least 10 days before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, shall be made, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and number of shares held by each stockholder. This list shall be open to examination by any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of 10 days prior to, as well as during, the meeting in the manner provided by law.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the stockholders; provided, that where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. If a quorum is present or represented at a reconvened meeting following such an adjournment, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
In all matters other than the election of Directors, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, if a quorum of such class or classes is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of outstanding shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Directors shall be elected as set forth in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws.
 
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such authorization may be accomplished by (a) the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent executing a writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature or (b) by electronic transmission to the intended holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service or similar agent duly authorized by the intended proxy holder to receive such transmission; provided, that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission by which a stockholder has authorized another person to act as proxy for such stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
A proxy shall be filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting or the delivery to the corporation of the consent to corporate action in writing. A proxy shall become invalid three years after the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy with respect to a specified meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any reconvened meeting following adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.
 
Each outstanding share entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter of an issue submitted to a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote upon each such issue.
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at an election of Directors may vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such stockholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election such stockholder has a right to vote; provided, however, that no cumulative voting shall be permitted in the election of Directors.
 
Subject to the following paragraph, any action that is properly brought before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and that could be taken at an
 
annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall (a) be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted with respect to the subject matter thereof having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted (as determined in accordance with subsection 2.6.2 hereof) and (b) be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the records of proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless written consents signed by the requisite number of stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof are delivered to the corporation, in the manner required by this Section 2, within 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation in the manner required by this Section 2. The validity of any consent executed by a proxy for a stockholder pursuant to an electronic transmission transmitted to such proxy holder by or upon the authorization of the stockholder shall be determined by or at the direction of the Secretary. A written record of the information upon which the person making such determination relied shall be made and kept in the records of the proceedings of the stockholders. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any such consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes of a meeting of the stockholders.
 
 
In advance of a meeting of stockholders, the Board shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of election at such meeting and to make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons to serve as alternate inspectors to serve in place of any inspector who is unable or fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of such meeting shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspector of elections at such meeting.
 
The inspectors of election shall:
(a) ascertain the number of shares of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share;
 
(b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots;
(c) count all votes and ballots;
(d) determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by them; and
(e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of the votes and ballots.
The validity of any proxy or ballot shall be determined by the inspectors of election in accordance with the applicable provisions of these Bylaws and the DGCL as then in effect. In determining the validity of any proxy transmitted by electronic transmission, the inspectors shall record in writing the information upon which they relied in making such determination. Each inspector of elections shall, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors of election may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist them in the performance of their duties.
SECTION 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by the Board.
 
The number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
No decrease in the number of Directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director. Each Director shall serve for the term he or she was elected, or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. Directors need not be stockholders of the corporation or residents of the State of Delaware.
 
A nominee for Director shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for Director set forth in Section 2.5 of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the
 
seventh day before the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If Directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
 
An annual Board meeting shall be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of stockholders. By resolution, the Board or any committee designated by the Board may specify the time and place either within or without the State of Delaware for holding regular meetings thereof without other notice than such resolution.
 
Special meetings of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or, in the case of special Board meetings, any Director, and, in the case of any special meeting of any committee appointed by the Board, by the Chairman thereof. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings may fix any place either within or without the State of Delaware as the place for holding any special meeting called by them.
 
Members of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.
 
Notice of a special Board or committee meeting stating the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be given to a Director as set forth in this Section 3.7. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting need be specified in the notice of such meeting.
 
If notice is given by personal delivery, the notice shall be effective if delivered to a Director at least twenty-four hours before the meeting.
 
If notice is delivered by mail, the notice shall be deemed effective if deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation with postage prepaid at least five days before the meeting.
 
If notice is given by private carrier, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation at least three days before the meeting.
 
If notice is delivered by wire or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched at least twenty-four hours before the meeting to a Director at his or her telephone number or other number shown on the records of the corporation.
 
If notice is delivered by electronic transmission, the notice shall be deemed effective when dispatched at least twenty-four hours before the meeting to a Director at his or her electronic transmission address shown on the records of the corporation.
 
If notice is delivered orally, by telephone or in person, the notice shall be deemed effective if personally given to the Director at least twenty-four hours before the meeting.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting.
 
The attendance of a Director at a Board or committee meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
A majority of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws or, if vacancies exist on the Board, a majority of the total number of Directors
 
then serving on the Board, provided, however, that such number may be not less than one-third of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any Board meeting. If less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
 
The act of the majority of the Directors present at a Board or committee meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board or committee, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL.
 
A Director of the corporation present at a Board or committee meeting at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or unless such Director files a written dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or forwards such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. A Director who voted in favor of such action may not dissent.
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee of the Board may be taken without a meeting if all of the members of the Board or of the committee of the Board, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission as provided in the DGCL and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
 
Any Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board, or to the registered office of the corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
At a meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose, or without a meeting pursuant to Section 2.14 of these Bylaws, one or more members of the Board (including the entire Board) may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of not less than a
 
majority of the shares entitled to elect the Director or Directors whose removal is sought in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
 
Any vacancy occurring on the Board may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors, whether or not they constitute a quorum of the Board. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected until the next election of Directors or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next election of Directors, and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualify.
 
 
The Board may, pursuant to the authority granted in subsection (2) of section 141(c) of the DGCL, designate one or more standing or temporary committees, each committee to consist of one or more Directors of the corporation. The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board establishing such committee or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to (a) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (b) adopting, amending or repealing any Bylaw of the corporation.
 
All committees so appointed shall keep regular minutes of their meetings and shall cause them to be recorded in books kept for that purpose.
 
A majority of the number of Directors composing any committee of the Board, as established and fixed by resolution of the Board, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of such committee but, if less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of such Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time
 
without further notice. The act of a majority of the members of a committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee.
 
Any member of any committee may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, the Board or the Chairman of such committee. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
The Board may remove from office any member of any committee elected or appointed by it.
 
By Board resolution, Directors and committee members may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each Board or committee meeting, a fixed sum for attendance at each Board or committee meeting, or a stated salary as Director or a committee member, or a combination of the foregoing. No such payment shall preclude any Director or committee member from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
SECTION 4. OFFICERS
 
The officers of the corporation shall be a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer, each of whom shall be elected by the Board. One or more Vice Presidents and such other officers and assistant officers, including a Chairman of the Board, may be elected or appointed by the Board, such officers and assistant officers to hold office for such period, have such authority and perform such duties as are provided in these Bylaws or as may be provided by resolution of the Board. Any officer may be assigned by the Board any additional title that the Board deems appropriate. The Board may delegate to any officer or agent the power to appoint any such subordinate officers or agents and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authority and duties. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.
 
The officers of the corporation shall be elected annually by the Board at the Board meeting held after the annual meeting of the stockholders. If the election of officers is not held at such meeting, such election shall be held as soon thereafter as a Board meeting
 
conveniently may be held. Unless an officer dies, resigns or is removed from office, he or she shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the Board or until his or her successor is elected.
 
Any officer may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice President, the Secretary or the Board. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the Board may be removed by the Board, and any officer appointed by an officer upon whom the power of appointment has been conferred by the Board of Directors may be removed by any such officer or by the Board, whenever in the judgment of the Board or of such officer, as the case may be, the best interests of the corporation would be served thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.
 
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification, creation of a new office or any other cause may be filled by the Board for the unexpired portion of the term, or for a new term established by the Board.
 
If elected, the Chairman of the Board shall perform such duties as shall be assigned to him or her by the Board from time to time and shall preside over meetings of the Board and stockholders unless another officer is appointed or designated by the Board as chairman of such meeting.
 
The Chief Executive Officer shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation, shall preside over meetings of the Board and stockholders in the absence of a Chairman of the Board and, subject to the Board's control, shall supervise and control all of the assets, business and affairs of the corporation. The Chief Executive Officer may sign deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts or other instruments, except when the signing and execution thereof have been expressly delegated by the Board or by these Bylaws to some other officer or agent of the corporation or are required by law to be otherwise signed or executed by some other officer or in some other manner. In general, the Chief Executive Officer shall perform all duties incident to the office of Chief Executive Officer and such other duties as are prescribed by the Board from time to time.
 
In the event of the death of the Chief Executive Officer or his inability to act, the President shall perform the duties of the Chief Executive Officer, except as may be limited by resolution of the Board, with all the powers of and subject to all the restrictions upon the Chief Executive Officer. The President may sign with the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary certificates for shares of the corporation. The President shall have, to the extent authorized by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board, the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer to sign deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts or other instruments. The President shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him or her by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board.
 
In the event of the death of the President or his or her inability to act, the Vice President (or if there is more than one Vice President, the Vice President who was designated by the Board as the successor to the President, or if no Vice President is so designated, the Vice President first elected to such office) shall perform the duties of the President, except as may be limited by resolution of the Board, with all the powers of and subject to all the restrictions upon the President. Any Vice President may sign with the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary certificates for shares of the corporation. Vice Presidents shall have, to the extent authorized by the President or the Board, the same powers as the President to sign deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts or other instruments. Vice Presidents shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to them by the President or the Board.
 
The Secretary shall be responsible for preparation of minutes of meetings of the Board and stockholders, maintenance of the corporation's records and stock registers, and authentication of the corporation's records and shall in general perform all duties incident to the office of Secretary and such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him or her by the President or the Board. In the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary may perform the duties of the Secretary.
 
The Treasurer shall have charge and custody of and be responsible for all funds and securities of the corporation; receive and give receipts for moneys due and payable to the corporation from any source whatsoever, and deposit all such moneys in the name of the corporation in banks, trust companies or other depositories selected in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws; sign certificates for shares of the corporation; and in general perform all of the duties incident to the office of Treasurer and such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him or her by the President or by the Board. In the absence of the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer may perform the duties of the Treasurer.
 
The salaries of the officers shall be fixed from time to time by the Board or by any person or persons to whom the Board has delegated such authority. No officer shall be prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she is also a Director of the corporation.
SECTION 5. CONTRACTS, LOANS, CHECKS AND DEPOSITS
 
The Board may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation. Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
 
No loans for borrowed money shall be contracted on behalf of the corporation and no evidences of indebtedness for borrowed money shall be issued in its name unless authorized by a resolution of the Board. Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
 
All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers, or agent or agents, of the corporation and in such manner as is from time to time determined by resolution of the Board.
 
All funds of the corporation not otherwise employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board may select.
SECTION 6. CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER
 
No shares of the corporation shall be issued unless authorized by the Board, which authorization shall include the maximum number of shares to be issued and the consideration to be received for each share.
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board may provide by resolution that some or all of any classes or series of the corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Each holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
 
entitled to a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board, President, or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, any of whose signatures may be a facsimile. The Board may in its discretion appoint responsible banks, trust companies or other professionals from time to time to act as transfer agents and registrars of the stock of the corporation; and, when such appointments shall have been made, no stock certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of such transfer agents and registered by one of such registrars. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person was such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. All certificates shall include on their face written notice of any restrictions that may be imposed on the transferability of such shares and shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified.
 
The stock transfer books shall be kept at the registered office or principal place of business of the corporation or at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar. The name and address of each person to whom shares are issued, together with the class and number of such shares and the date of issue thereof, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. The person in whose name shares stand on the books of the corporation shall be deemed by the corporation to be the owner thereof for all purposes.
 
Except to the extent that the corporation has obtained an opinion of counsel acceptable to the corporation that transfer restrictions are not required under applicable securities laws, or has otherwise satisfied itself that such transfer restrictions are not required, all certificates representing shares of the corporation shall bear a legend on the face of the certificate, or on the reverse of the certificate if a reference to the legend is contained on the face, that reads substantially as follows:
"The securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law, and no interest therein may be sold, distributed, assigned, offered, pledged or otherwise transferred unless (a) there is an effective registration statement under such Act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction involving said securities or (b) this corporation receives an opinion of legal counsel for the holder of these securities (concurred in by legal counsel for this corporation) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or this corporation otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. Neither the offering of the securities nor any offering materials have been reviewed by any administrator under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state law."
 
If any securities of the corporation are issued pursuant to Regulation S ("Regulation S") of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), the corporation will refuse to register any subsequent transfer of such securities if such transfer is not made in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the 1933 Act or pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the 1933 Act.
 
The transfer of shares of the corporation shall be made only on the stock transfer books of the corporation pursuant to authorization or document of transfer made by the holder of record thereof or by his or her legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney-in-fact authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificate, if any, shall be issued until the former certificates, if any, for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled.
 
In the case of a lost, destroyed or mutilated certificate, a new certificate may be issued therefor upon such terms and indemnity to the corporation as the Board may prescribe.
 
Shares owned by the corporation in another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Board may determine or, in the absence of such determination, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President of the corporation.
SECTION 7. BOOKS AND RECORDS
The corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account, stock transfer books, minutes of the proceedings of its stockholders and Board and such other records as may be necessary or advisable.
SECTION 8. ACCOUNTING YEAR
The accounting year of the corporation shall be the calendar year, provided that if a different accounting year is at any time selected for purposes of federal income taxes, the accounting year shall be the year so selected.
SECTION 9. SEAL
The seal of the corporation, if any, shall consist of the name of the corporation, the state of its incorporation and the year of its incorporation.
 
SECTION 10. INDEMNIFICATION
 
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a Director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as such a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection 10.2 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this subsection 10.1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this subsection 10.1 or otherwise.
 
If a claim under subsection 10.1 hereof is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid
 
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Section 10, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The corporation, without further stockholder approval, may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, employee or agent in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 10 and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section 10.
 
The corporation may, by action of the Board, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees or agents or groups of employees or agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Section 10 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the corporation; provided, however, that an undertaking shall be made by an employee or agent only if required by the Board.
 
Any person who is or was a Director or officer of the corporation who is or was serving (a) as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its Directors is held by the corporation or (b) in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under subsection 10.1 hereof.
 
The Board may establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these Bylaws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENTS OR REPEAL
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation; provided, however, the Board of Directors may not repeal or amend any bylaw that the stockholders have expressly provided may not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation.
Notwithstanding any amendment to Section 10 hereof or repeal of these Bylaws, or of any amendment or repeal of any of the procedures that may be established by the Board pursuant to Section 10 hereof, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
The foregoing Amended and Restated Bylaws were adopted by the Board of Directors on February 12, 2009.

Exhibit 99.1
To our shareowners:
In this turbulent global economy, our fundamental approach remains the same. Stay heads down, focused on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long-term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn't otherwise contemplate. It supports the failure and iteration required for invention, and it frees us to pioneer in unexplored spaces. Seek instant gratification  or the elusive promise of it  and chances are you'll find a crowd there ahead of you. Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution. "Working backwards" from customer needs can be contrasted with a "skills-forward" approach where existing skills and competencies are used to drive business opportunities. The skills-forward approach says, "We are really good at X. What else can we do with X?" That's a useful and rewarding business approach. However, if used exclusively, the company employing it will never be driven to develop fresh skills. Eventually the existing skills will become outmoded. Working backwards from customer needs often that we acquire new competencies and exercise new muscles, never mind how uncomfortable and awkward-feeling those first steps might be.

Kindle is a good example of our fundamental approach. More than four years ago, we began with a long-term vision: every book, ever printed, in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds. The customer experience we envisioned didn't allow for any hard lines of demarcation between Kindle the device and Kindle the service  the two had to blend together seamlessly. Amazon had never designed or built a hardware device, but rather than change the vision to accommodate our then-existing skills, we hired a number of talented (and missionary!) hardware engineers and got started learning a new institutional skill, one that we needed to better serve readers in the future.
We're grateful and excited that Kindle sales have exceeded our most optimistic expectations. On February 23, we began shipping Kindle 2. If you haven't seen it, Kindle 2 is everything customers loved about the original Kindle, only thinner, faster, with a crisper display, and longer battery life, and capable of holding 1,500 books. You can choose from more than 250,000 of the most popular books, magazines, and newspapers. Wireless delivery is free, and you'll have your book in less than 60 seconds. We've received thousands of feedback emails from customers about Kindle, and  remarkably  26% of them contain the word "love."
Customer Experience Pillars
In our retail business, we have strong conviction that customers value low prices, vast selection, and fast, convenient delivery and that these needs will remain stable over time. It is difficult for us to imagine that ten years from now, customers will want higher prices, less selection, or slower delivery. Our belief in the durability of these pillars is what gives us the confidence required to invest in strengthening them. We know that the energy we put in now will continue to pay dividends well into the future.
Our pricing objective is to earn customer trust, not to optimize short-term profit dollars. We take it as an article of faith that pricing in this manner is the best way to grow our aggregate profit dollars over the long term. We may make less per item, but by consistently earning trust we will sell many more items. Therefore, we offer low prices across our entire product range. For the same reason, we continue to invest in our free shipping programs, including Amazon Prime. Customers are well-informed and smart, and they evaluate the total cost, including delivery charges, when making their purchasing decisions. In the last 12 months, customers worldwide have saved more than $800 million by taking advantage of our free shipping offers.
We're relentlessly focused on adding selection, both by increasing selection inside existing categories and by adding new categories. We've added 28 new categories since 2007. One business that is rapidly growing and continues to surprise me is our shoe store, Endless.com, which we launched in 2007.
Fast, reliable delivery is important to customers. In 2005, we launched Amazon Prime. For $79 per year,
1
Prime members get unlimited express two-day shipping for free and upgrades to one-day delivery for just $3.99. In 2007, we launched Fulfillment by Amazon, a new service for third-party sellers. With FBA, sellers warehouse their inventory in our global fulfillment network, and we pick, pack, and ship to the end customer on the sellers' behalf. FBA items are eligible for Amazon Prime and Super Saver Shipping  just as if the items were Amazon-owned inventory. As a result, FBA both improves the customer experience and drives seller sales. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we shipped more than 3 million units on behalf of sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon, a win-win for customers and sellers.
Prudent Spending
The customer-experience path we've chosen requires us to have an efficient cost structure. The good news for shareowners is that we see much opportunity for improvement in that regard. Everywhere we look (and we all look), we find what experienced Japanese manufacturers would call "muda" or waste.
2
I find this incredibly energizing. I see it as potential  years and years of variable and fixed productivity gains and more efficient, higher velocity, more flexible capital expenditures.
Our primary financial goal remains maximizing long-term free cash flow and doing so with high rates of return on invested capital. We are investing heartily in Amazon Web Services, in tools for third-party sellers, in digital media, in China, and in new product categories. And we make these investments with the belief that they can be of meaningful scale and can clear our high bar for returns.
Around the world, amazing, inventive, and hard-working Amazonians are putting customers first. I take great pride in being part of this team. We thank you, our owners, for your support, for your encouragement, and for joining us on our continuing adventure.
As always, I attach our 1997 letter to shareowners. Even as the rate of change accelerates, we hope and believe our focus on what stays the same should serve us well.

To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 23, 2009. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Second Quarter 2009 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of

inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE, July 22, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ- AMZN) today announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Zappos.com, Inc., a leader in online apparel and footwear sales that strives to provide shoppers with the best possible service and selection. The acquisition brings together two companies who share a passion for serving customers and whose customers benefit from cultures of innovation and long term thinking.
"Zappos is a customer focused company," said Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "We see great opportunities for both companies to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers."
Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon will acquire all of the outstanding shares and assume all outstanding options and warrants of Zappos in exchange for approximately 10 million shares of Amazon common stock, equal to approximately $807 million based on the average closing price for the 45 trading days ending July 17, 2009. In addition, Amazon will provide Zappos employees with $40 million in cash and restricted stock units. Subject to various closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close during the Fall of 2009.
Following the acquisition, the Zappos management team will remain intact and Zappos will operate its successful brand, customer experience and unique culture of service independently with headquarters in Las Vegas, NV.

Exhibit 99.2
To: All Zappos Employees
Subject: Zappos and Amazon
Please set aside 20 minutes to carefully read this entire email. (My apologies for the occasional use of formal-sounding language, as parts of it are written in a particular way for legal reasons.)
Today is a big day in Zappos history.
This morning, our board approved and we signed what's known as a "definitive agreement", in which all of the existing shareholders and investors of Zappos (there are over 100) will be exchanging their Zappos stock for Amazon stock. Once the exchange is done, Amazon will become the only shareholder of Zappos stock.
Over the next few days, you will probably read headlines that say "Amazon acquires Zappos" or "Zappos sells to Amazon". While those headlines are technically correct, they don't really properly convey the spirit of the transaction. (I personally would prefer the headline "Zappos and Amazon sitting in a tree")
We plan to continue to run Zappos the way we have always run Zappos  continuing to do what we believe is best for our brand, our culture, and our business. From a practical point of view, it will be as if we are switching out our current shareholders and board of directors for a new one, even though the technical legal structure may be different.
We think that now is the right time to join forces with Amazon because there is a huge opportunity to leverage each other's strengths and move even faster towards our long term vision. For Zappos, our vision remains the same: delivering happiness to customers, employees, and vendors. We just want to get there faster.
We are excited about doing this for 3 main reasons:
1) We think that there is a huge opportunity for us to really accelerate the growth of the Zappos brand and culture, and we believe that Amazon is the best partner to help us get there faster.
2) Amazon supports us in continuing to grow our vision as an independent entity, under the Zappos brand and with our unique culture.
3) We want to align ourselves with a shareholder and partner that thinks really long term (like we do at Zappos), as well as do what's in the best interest of our existing shareholders and investors.
I will go through each of the above points in more detail below, but first, let me get to the top 3 burning questions that I'm guessing many of you will have.
TOP 3 BURNING QUESTIONS
Q: Will I still have a job?
As mentioned above, we plan to continue to run Zappos as an independent entity. In legal terminology, Zappos will be a "wholly-owned subsidiary" of Amazon. Your job is just as secure as it was a month ago.
Q: Will the Zappos culture change?
Our culture at Zappos is unique and always evolving and changing, because one of our core values is to Embrace and Drive Change. What happens to our culture is up to us, which has always been true. Just like before, we are in control of our destiny and how our culture evolves.
A big part of the reason why Amazon is interested in us is because they recognize the value of our culture, our people, and our brand. Their desire is for us to continue to grow and develop our culture (and perhaps even a little bit of our culture may rub off on them).
They are not looking to have their folks come in and run Zappos unless we ask them to. That being said, they have a lot of experience and expertise in a lot of areas, so we're very excited about the opportunities to tap into their knowledge, expertise, and resources, especially on the technology side. This is about making the Zappos brand, culture, and business even stronger than it is today.
Q: Are Tony, Alfred, or Fred leaving?
No, we have no plans to leave. We believe that we are at the very beginning of what's possible for Zappos and are very excited about the future and what we can accomplish for Zappos with Amazon as our new partner. Part of the reason for doing this is so that we can get a lot more done more quickly.
There is an additional Q&A section at the end of this email, but I wanted to make sure we got the top 3 burning questions out of the way first. Now that we've covered those questions, I wanted to share in more detail our thinking behind the scenes that led us to this decision.
First, I want to apologize for the suddenness of this announcement. As you know, one of our core values is to Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication, and if I could have it my way, I would have shared much earlier that we were in discussions with Amazon so that all employees could be involved in the decision process that we went through along the way. Unfortunately, because Amazon is a public company, there are securities laws that prevented us from talking about this to most of our employees until today.
We've been on friendly terms with Amazon for many years, as they have always been interested in Zappos and have always had a great respect for our brand.
Several months ago, they reached out to us and said they wanted to join forces with us so that we could accelerate the growth of our business, our brand, and our culture. When they said they wanted us to continue to build the Zappos brand (as opposed to folding us into Amazon), we decided it was worth exploring what a partnership would look like.
We learned that they truly wanted us to continue to build the Zappos brand and continue to build the Zappos culture in our own unique way. I think "unique" was their way of saying "fun and a little weird." :)
Over the past several months, as we got to know each other better, both sides became more and more excited about the possibilities for leveraging each other's strengths. We realized that we are both very customer-focused companies  we just focus on different ways of making our customers happy.
Amazon focuses on low prices, vast selection and convenience to make their customers happy, while Zappos does it through developing relationships, creating personal emotional connections, and delivering high touch ("WOW") customer service.
We realized that Amazon's resources, technology, and operational experience had the potential to greatly accelerate our growth so that we could grow the Zappos brand and culture even faster. On the flip side, through the process Amazon realized that it really was the case that our culture is the platform that enables us to deliver the Zappos experience to our customers. Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon) made it clear that he had a great deal of respect for our culture and that Amazon would look to protect it.
We asked our board members what they thought of the opportunity. Michael Moritz, who represents Sequoia Capital (one of our investors and board members), wrote the following: "You now have the opportunity to accelerate Zappos' progress and to make the name and the brand and everything associated with it an enduring, permanent part of peoples' lives... You are now free to let your imagination roam - and to contemplate initiatives and undertakings that today, in our more constrained setting, we could not take on."
One of the great things about Amazon is that they are very long term thinkers, just like we are at Zappos. Alignment in very long term thinking is hard to find in a partner or investor, and we felt very lucky and excited to learn that both Amazon and Zappos shared this same philosophy.
All this being said, this was not an easy decision. Over the past several months, we had to weigh all the pros and cons along with all the potential benefits and risks. At the end of the day, we realized that, once it was determined that this was in the best interests of our shareholders, it basically all boiled down to asking ourselves 2 questions:
1) Do we believe that this will accelerate the growth of the Zappos brand and help us fulfill our mission of delivering happiness faster?
2) Do we believe that we will continue to be in control of our own destiny so that we can continue to grow our unique culture?
After spending a lot of time with Amazon and getting to know them and understanding their intentions better, we reached the conclusion that the answers to these 2 questions are YES and YES.
The Zappos brand will continue to be separate from the Amazon brand. Although we'll have access to many of Amazon's resources, we need to continue to build our brand and our culture just as we always have. Our mission remains the same: delivering happiness to all of our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, and our vendors. (As a side note, we plan to continue to maintain the relationships that we have with our vendors ourselves, and Amazon will continue to maintain the relationships that they have with their vendors.)
We will be holding an all hands meeting soon to go over all of this in more detail. Please email me any questions that you may have so that we can cover as many as possible during the all hands meeting and/or a follow-up email.
We signed what's known as the "definitive agreement" today, but we still need to go through the process of getting government approval, so we are anticipating that this transaction actually won't officially close for at least a few months. We are legally required by the SEC to be in what's known as a "quiet period", so if you get any questions related to the transaction from anyone including customers, vendors, or the media, please let them know that we are in a quiet period mandated by law and have them email , which is a special email account that Alfred and I will be monitoring.
tree@zappos.com
Alfred and I would like to say thanks to the small group of folks on our finance and legal teams and from our advisors at Morgan Stanley, Fenwick & West, and PricewaterhouseCoopers who have been working really hard, around the clock, and behind the scenes over the last several months to help make all this possible.
Before getting to the Q&A section, I'd also like to thank everyone for taking the time to read this long email and for helping us get to where we are today.
It's definitely an emotional day for me. The feelings I'm experiencing are similar to what I felt in college on graduation day: excitement about the future mixed with fond memories of the past. The last 10 years were an incredible ride, and I'm excited about what we will accomplish together over the next 10 years as we continue to grow Zappos!

Q&A
Q: Will we still continue to grow our headquarters out of Vegas?
Yes! Just like before, we plan to continue to grow our Las Vegas operations as long as we can continue to attract the right talent for each of our departments. We do not have any plans to move any departments, nor does Amazon want us to because they recognize that our culture is what makes the Zappos brand special.
Q: What will happen to our warehouse in Kentucky?
As many of you know, we were strategic in choosing our warehouse location due to its proximity to the UPS Worldport hub in Louisville. Amazon does not have any warehouse locations that are closer to the Worldport hub. There is the possibility that they may want to store some of their inventory in our warehouse or vice-versa. Right now, both Zappos and Amazon believe that the best customer experience is to continue running our warehouse in Kentucky at its current location.
Q: Will we be reducing staff in order to gain operational efficiency?
There are no plans to do so at this time. Both Zappos and Amazon are focused on growth, which means we will need to hire more people to help us grow.
Q: Will we get a discount at Amazon?
No, because we are planning on continuing to run Zappos as a separate company with our own culture and core values. And we're not going to be giving the Zappos discount to Amazon employees either, unless they bake us cookies and deliver them in person.
Q: Will our benefits change?
No, we are not planning on making any changes (outside of the normal course of business) to our benefit packages.
Q: Do we keep our core values?
Yes, we will keep our core values, and Amazon will keep their core values.
Q: Will our training/pipeline programs or progression plans change? Will there still be more growth opportunities?
We will continue building out our pipeline and progression as planned. The whole point of this combination is to accelerate our growth, so if anything, we are actually anticipating more growth opportunities for everyone.
Q: Will we continue to do the special things we do for our customers? Are our customer service policies going to change?
Just like before, that's completely up to us to decide.
Q: Can you tell me a bit more about Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO)? What is he like?
We'd like to show an 8-minute video of Jeff Bezos that will give you some insight into his personality and way of thinking. He shares some of what he's learned as an entrepreneur, as well as some of the mistakes he's made.
[Transcript Begins]
Jeff Bezos: Hello, my name is Jeff Bezos. I started Amazon.com about fifteen years ago. Tons of stories from the early days. We started the company in my house and we didn't have enough electrical power in the house at the starting point  we only had about four employees then, but we already had enough computers and computer servers, and we had to string these big, orange electric extension cords from every room in the house to get enough power into the room where the office was. So, we were basically  all of the circuit breakers were flipping. We couldn't plug a vacuum cleaner in anywhere without flipping all the circuit breakers, so we finally had to move to a real office. When we launched the store, we made a very early mistake  it's one of my favorite software bugs of all time. We found that customers could order a negative quantity of books and we would credit their credit card with the price  and I assume, wait around for them to ship us the books! We fixed that one  it's fixed. We've made a bunch of other mistakes over time but we've learned a lot  my whole body is covered in scar tissue.
We initially programmed a bell to ring every time we got an order and I'm very pleased to say that within the first thirty days of doing business that bell got annoying, so we had to turn it off. There was a great moment when we were examining every order that would come into Amazon, and it was always a family member placing the order. And the first order that we got from a stranger  I remember there were probably a half a dozen or ten of us in the company at the time  we were all gathered around after the bell rang and looking at the order and we're like, "Is that your mom? That's not my mom" and thus it began.
A lot has happened over the last fifteen years. As I've said, we've made a lot of mistakes  we've learned some things and I want to tell you everything I know. I can guarantee you, everything I know  it's a very short list. This won't take long and it's complete too.
Well, the first thing I know is that you need to obsess over customers. I can tell you that we have been doing this from the very beginning, and it's the only reason that Amazon.com exists today in any form. We've always put customers first. When given the choice of obsessing over competitors or obsessing over customers, we always obsess over customers. We pay attention to what our competitors do, but it's not where we put our energy  it's not where we get our motivation from. We really like to start with customers and work backwards. Again, that is the key thing that I know and it covers a lot of other mistakes. If you're truly obsessed over customers, it will cover a lot of errors.
The second thing I know is invent'. It's really important to invent. Any time we have a problem, we never accept either/or' thinking. We try to figure out a solution that gets both things and that often requires invention. But you can invent your way out of any box if you believe that you can and what we talk about is inventing on behalf of customers. It's not a customer's job to invent for themselves. You need to listen to customers  it's critical  if you don't listen to customers, you'll go astray. But, they won't tell you everything, so you need to invent on their behalf. That focus on invention has served us well. Some of the recent things  Kindle and EC2, the elastic compute cloud  these are things that we would have never gotten to if we didn't have an inventive culture. Those are kind of large grain things, but there are small things too.
And then, think long term'. This is really critical. Any company that wants to focus on customers and put customers first  any company that wants to invent on behalf of customers has to be willing to think long term. It's actually much rarer than you might think. I find that most of the initiatives we undertake may take five to seven years before they pay any dividends for the company. They may start paying dividends for customers right away but they often take a long time to pan out for shareholders and the company. So, that ability to think in five year and seven year time frames, really is very, very useful for us and it's definitely one of the things that I know. It requires, by the way and allows a willingness to be misunderstood. If you think long term  many of the inventions that we undertake, maybe if they are disruptive in any way, they may not be understood in the early innings and it's always been very important for us to think long term so that we can tolerate being misunderstood. We've been called Amazon.toast', Amazon.con'  many different things and many of them not appropriate for a video. If we think we're right, then we continue. If we think we're wrong  if we're criticized about something and we think we're wrong, then we change it  we fix it. So, it's important to really think about those things but never to buckle to standard pressures that come on that really force short-term thinking. It's a huge competitive advantage to be able to think long term and you get to serve customers much better. That's all that I know, really. I know one more thing and I'll save it for the end.
This is a very exciting day. Zappos is a company that I have long admired, and for a very important reason. Zappos has a customer obsession which is so easy for me to admire. It is the starting point for Zappos  it is the place where Zappos begins and ends and that is a very key factor for me. I get all weak-kneed when I see a customer-obsessed company and Zappos certainly is that. Zappos also has a totally unique culture. I've seen a lot of companies and I have never seen a company with a culture like Zappos' and I think that kind of unique culture is a very significant asset and I'm super excited about that.
I've spent a lot of time talking with Fred, Alfred and Tony and I have a good feeling for how important that culture is to Zappos, the Zappos brand, the Zappos customers and the Zappos employees. That culture and the Zappos brand are huge assets that I value very much and I want to see those things continue. You're in such great hands with Fred, Alfred and Tony  that's a really big deal. I've seen a lot of leaders of companies too, and I haven't seen people better than those three.
There's a lot of growth ahead of us with Zappos  this really is the beginning. I'm just totally excited about what can be accomplished over time. My belief is we haven't seen anything yet. As much as Zappos has accomplished already  and it's a lot  with that unique culture and that great Zappos brand, and those terrific leaders, I know that it's just the very beginning.
And that brings me to the final thing that I know. It's always Day One'. There's always more invention in the future, always more customer innovation, new ways to obsess over customers. I'm super excited over Zappos. Thank you.
[Transcript Ends]
Q: I'm a business/financial reporter. Can you talk like a banker and use fancy-sounding language that we can print in a business publication?
Zappos is an online footwear category leader and Amazon believes Zappos is the right team with a unique culture, proven track record, and the experience to become a leading soft goods company; Zappos' customer service obsession reinforces Amazon's mission to be the earth's most customer-centric company; Great brand, strong vendor relationships, broad selection, large active and repeat customer base; Amazon believes Zappos is a great business  growing, profitable and positive cash flow; Accelerate combined companies' scale and growth trajectory in the shoe, apparel and accessories space; Significant synergy opportunities, including technology, marketing, and possible international expansion.
Q: What is the purchase price?
This is not a cash transaction. This is a stock exchange. Our shareholders and option holders will be issued approximately 10 million Amazon shares on a fully converted basis. The details of the deal terms and how the shares will be distributed will be filed with the SEC on Form S-4 and will be publicly available when it is filed.
Q: Can you talk like a lawyer now?
This email was sent on July 22, 2009. In connection with the proposed merger, Amazon.com will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will contain a consent solicitation/prospectus. Shareholders and investors will be able to obtain the consent solicitation/prospectus when it becomes available at www.sec.gov or www.amazon.com/ir.
Zappos' shareholders and investors are urged to carefully read the consent solicitation/prospectus when it becomes available and other relevant documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the proposed merger because they contain important information about Amazon.com, Zappos and the proposed merger.
Certain statements contained in this email are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect current expectations, are inherently uncertain and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Factors that could cause future results to differ materially from expected results include those set forth in Amazon.com's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated July 22, 2009.
Q: Can you please stop?
okthxbye

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 23, 2009 and exclude Zappos.com, Inc. financial results. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Third Quarter 2009 Guidance
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and

technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
Table of Contents
On July 22, 2009, Amazon.com, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire Zappos.com, Inc. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com will merge with and into Zappos.com (the "Merger"), with Zappos.com continuing as the surviving corporation and a subsidiary of Amazon.com after the Merger.
The total Merger consideration payable to Zappos.com equity holders is equal to (a) $838,000,000, minus (b) $52,000,000 for Zappos.com's net debt as of March 31, 2009, plus (c) the lesser of $35,000,000 and the aggregate exercise price of all stock options and warrants outstanding and unexercised as of the closing of the Merger, plus the aggregate exercise price of all stock options and warrants exercised between June 8, 2009 and the closing of the Merger, minus (d) the lesser of $15,000,000 and Zappos.com's transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.
The Merger consideration will be paid in shares of Amazon.com common stock, except for payment of fractional shares in cash. The aggregate number of Amazon.com shares to be issued in connection with the Merger, including the number reserved for future issuance under vested and unvested options that will be assumed by Amazon.com, is equal to the total Merger consideration divided by $81.09, which is the average of the closing prices of Amazon.com common stock for the 45 trading days ending July 17, 2009, and is expected to equal approximately 10 million shares of common stock. In addition, Amazon.com will provide Zappos.com employees with $40 million in cash and restricted stock units for retention purposes.
At closing of the Merger, Amazon.com will deduct from the Merger consideration and deposit into an escrow fund 10% of the total number of shares of Amazon.com common stock issuable to Zappos.com shareholders as security for indemnification claims. Holders of options assumed in the Merger who so consent will indemnify Amazon to a similar extent as if they had been Zappos.com shareholders at the closing. On February 28, 2011, subject to any pending indemnification claims, sufficient shares will be released from escrow to reduce the escrowed amount to $40 million, which will remain in escrow and subject to certain categories of Amazon.com indemnification claims until the fourth anniversary of closing.
The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including obtaining the approval of Zappos.com shareholders, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either Amazon.com or Zappos.com upon the occurrence of certain events, including if the Merger has not closed by December 31, 2009, or by written consent of both Amazon.com and Zappos.com. The Merger is expected to close during the Fall of 2009.
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, shareholders that are affiliates of Zappos.com, who collectively hold sufficient shares to approve the Merger, have entered into a voting agreement with Amazon.com in which they have agreed to vote their shares of Zappos.com capital stock to approve the Merger. Certain significant shareholders have also executed non-competition and non-solicitation agreements for between two and three years from the closing.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by Amazon.com and Zappos.com. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the applicable agreement, and were not intended to be and should not be relied upon by shareholders of Amazon.com or Zappos.com; should not be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk between the parties; have in some cases been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the applicable agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the agreement; may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be material to investors; and were made only as of the date of the applicable agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the agreement and are subject to more recent developments.

The failure to provide such notice or any delay in providing it, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay (other than in the event that such notice is provided after the applicable time by which a claim must be made under this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1(b)). If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result from a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and if such Third Party Claim does not attempt to impose

equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which expenses shall not be applied against any indemnity limitation herein) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such Indemnified Party's counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing, (B) does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (C) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder, or (D) could affect the liability of Parent, the Company or their Affiliates in periods not specifically addressed in such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or Claim is made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.
(b) If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party (which in the case of Parent shall be in the form of an Officer's Certificate) and shall
 
provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request (but, at a minimum, shall provide the following: (i) the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of Losses not yet incurred or paid may be the maximum amount reasonably likely to be incurred or paid), and identifying the specific clause or clauses of this Agreement pursuant to which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed) the facts and circumstances related to the breach and the individual items of such Losses arising out of, resulting from or in connection with such breach). The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article VIII (other than in the event that such notice is provided after the applicable time by which a claim must be made under this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1(b)). If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Party's claim for the difference, which payment in the case of indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be made by pro rata and severally by forfeiture of shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and forfeiture of Parent Options by Consenting Optionholders.

Officer's Certificate
 
Section 8.4(d), equal to the amount of such Losses (or in the case of each Consenting Optionholder, to the extent such Consenting Optionholder has not contributed shares into the Indemnity Escrow Fund to cover their respective several obligation for such Losses, Parent shall be entitled to offset such Losses against their respective Parent Options pursuant to the Option Consent).
(d) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.4(c) hereof (or with respect to the Consenting Optionholders, in connection with determining their respective pro rata share of the Losses), the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at Parent Stock Price.
(e) At the time of delivery of any Officer's Certificate to the Escrow Agent as described in Section 8.4(c), a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Representative, and for a period of 20 days after such delivery the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.4(c) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 20 day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.4(c) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and Parent prior to the expiration of such 20 day period.
(f) In case the Shareholder Representative shall timely object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, the parties shall resolve any such dispute as provided in Section 10.10.
(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.10, each Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Claim in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any Claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect to such Claim or the matters alleged therein and agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim anywhere.

(b) If the Indemnity Escrow Ratio used to calculate the number of shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Indemnity Escrow Fund on behalf of the Indemnifying Shareholders is greater than 10% as of the Closing Date, and if between the Closing Date and the thirty day anniversary of the Closing Date any Shareholder who was not an Indemnifying Shareholder as of the Closing Date shall have withdrawn or relinquished his/her/its rights as dissenting shareholders under Chapter 13 of the CGCL in connection with the Merger (a "), Parent agrees that it shall, as soon as commercially practicable after such thirty day anniversary of the Closing Date, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to each Indemnifying Shareholder (that was not a Relinquishing Shareholder), a pro rata portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock placed in the Indemnity Escrow Fund by such Relinquishing Shareholders to reflect an Indemnity Escrow Ratio as of the Closing for each such Indemnifying Shareholder as of such thirty day anniversary date of the Closing of: (x) 0.10 multiplied
Relinquishing Shareholder"
 
by the ratio of (y) the total number of outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time on a fully diluted basis (i.e., inclusive of Stock Purchase Rights) divided by that number equal to (1) the total number of outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., inclusive of Stock Purchase Rights) minus (2) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock that are dissenting shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL as of such thirty day anniversary of the Closing Date. Additionally, as provided in the Option Consent, such Consenting Optionholders shall also be subject to a pro rata reduction in their indemnity obligations under the Option Consent in an amount consistent with the formulation described above to account for any such shares of Parent Common Stock placed in the Indemnity Escrow Fund by such Relinquishing Shareholders.
(c) Promptly, but in any event within five Business Days, after February 28, 2011, Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release all amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund in excess of (i) $40 million of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Stock Price), plus (ii) an amount of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Stock Price) equal to any unsatisfied indemnification claims pending that were described in any Officer's Certificate delivered prior to February 28, 2011 to the Indemnifying Shareholders pro rata in accordance with the contributions made to the Escrow Fund by such Indemnifying Shareholders (as adjusted for any amounts delivered to Parent with respect to a several Breach by any such Indemnifying Shareholder).
(d) Upon the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund on the four year anniversary of the Closing Date (or such later date to the extent of pending claims) and otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver any shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Shareholders. Delivery of such Parent Common Stock (and any amounts earned thereon) to Indemnifying Shareholders shall be made pro rata in accordance with the contributions made to the Escrow Fund by such Indemnifying Shareholders (as adjusted for any amounts delivered to Parent with respect to a several Breach by any such Indemnifying Shareholder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall make no distributions to Indemnifying Shareholders from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent necessary and shall retain an amount equal to any unsatisfied indemnification claims pending that were described in any Officer's Certificate delivered prior to the four year anniversary of the Closing Date.
(e) Each Indemnifying Shareholder shall have voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund by or on behalf of such Indemnifying Shareholder (and any additional shares as may be issued after the Effective Time with respect to the shares constituting the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund Amount upon any stock split, dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time) unless paid pursuant to an indemnification claim. Each Indemnifying Shareholder shall have the right to receive any cash dividends or distributions made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock deposited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, but any
 
additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued after the Effective Time with respect to the shares constituting the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund Amount, in either case, upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time shall be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, or in the case of the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund. For federal income Tax purposes, the Indemnifying Shareholders on whose behalf the Shares of Parent Common Stock in the Indemnity Escrow Fund were deposited will be treated as the owners of such Shares unless and until such Shares are returned to Parent.
(f) Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund shall be held in a segregated account by the Escrow Agent and shall be solely available to reimburse the Shareholder Representative for expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in performing its duties hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto) and in connection therewith, the Shareholder Representative shall have the authority to instruct the Escrow Agent to liquidate any shares of Parent Common Stock then placed in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund and to distribute any amounts received upon such liquidation to either the Shareholder Representative personally, or at the instruction of the Shareholder Representative, to any third party providing services to the Shareholder Representative in connection with his obligations hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto, and for purpose of clarity, relating to the defense of third party claims against the Indemnifying Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders). If any shares of Parent Common Stock remain in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund at such time as the Shareholder Representative reasonably believes that all of his obligations have been satisfied pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, such shares shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Shareholders based on their pro rata interest therein (as calculated based on the number of shares of Parent Common Stock placed in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund by each such Indemnifying Shareholder). For federal income Tax purposes, the Shareholders on whose behalf the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund were deposited will be treated as the owners of such Shares and of any income thereon or proceeds therefrom unless and until such amounts are distributed from the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund to pay expenses as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
(g) Upon any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock to Indemnifying Shareholders from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, in lieu of any fractional shares, Indemnifying Shareholders who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder's respective proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of all such Indemnifying Shareholder, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which would otherwise be released. Prior to any such release, the Escrow Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to Indemnifying Shareholders
 
(without excluding fractional shares), over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to Indemnifying Shareholders (excluding fractional shares) (such excess being collectively called the ""). The Escrow Agent, as agent and trustee for the Indemnifying Shareholders, shall as promptly as reasonably practicable sell the Excess Parent Common Stock at the prevailing prices on NASDAQ (or on the principal exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is then traded or quoted). The sales of the Excess Parent Common Stock by the Escrow Agent shall be executed on NASDAQ (or such other exchange) through one or more member firms of NASDAQ (or such other exchange) and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the Indemnifying Shareholders to whom fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise would have been issued, the Escrow Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to Indemnifying Shareholders in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amounts to such Indemnifying Shareholders.

Operating cash flow was $2.25 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $1.27 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2008. Free cash flow increased 98% to $1.92 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $0.97 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2008.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 451 million on September 30, 2009, compared with 448 million a year ago.

"Earlier this week we began shipping the latest generation Kindle. Its 3G wireless works in the U.S. and 100 countries, and we've just lowered its price to $259."

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of October 22, 2009. This guidance excludes the impact of Zappos.com, Inc., including approximately $35 million of expenses primarily related to employee compensation costs, amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses that would be recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 if the transaction closes as planned. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Fourth Quarter 2009 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)January 28, 2010Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Operating cash flow was $3.29 billion in 2009, compared with $1.70 billion in 2008. Free cash flow increased 114% to $2.92 billion in 2009, compared with $1.36 billion in 2008.

Excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales would have grown 37% compared with fourth quarter 2008.

Net income increased 71% to $384 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with net income of $225 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2008.
"Millions of people now own Kindles," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "And Kindle owners read, a lot. When we have both editions, we sell 6 Kindle books for every 10 physical books. This is year-to-date and includes only paid books  free Kindle books would make the number even higher. It's been an exciting 27 months."
Full Year 2009

Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Separately, the Company is announcing that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $2 billion of the Company's common stock. The program allows the Company to opportunistically repurchase its shares from time to time when it believes that doing so would enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration. Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or a combination of the foregoing. This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous $1 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2008.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 28, 2010. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
First Quarter 2010 Guidance
 
 
We are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition  Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, as of January 1, 2010. The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in our first quarter 2010 guidance.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
To our shareowners:
The financial results for 2009 reflect the cumulative effect of 15 years of customer experience improvements: increasing selection, speeding delivery, reducing cost structure so we can afford to offer customers ever-lower prices, and many others. This work has been done by a large number of smart, relentless, customer-devoted people across all areas of the company. We are proud of our low prices, our reliable delivery, and our in-stock position on even obscure and hard-to-find items. We also know that we can still be much better, and we're dedicated to improving further.
Some notable highlights from 2009:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Senior leaders that are new to Amazon are often surprised by how little time we spend discussing actual financial results or debating projected financial outputs. To be clear, we take these financial outputs seriously, but we believe that focusing our energy on the controllable inputs to our business is the most effective way to maximize
financial outputs over time. Our annual goal setting process begins in the fall, and concludes early in the new year after we've completed our peak holiday quarter. Our goal setting sessions are lengthy, spirited, and detail-oriented. We have a high bar for the experience our customers deserve and a sense of urgency to improve that experience.
We've been using this same annual process for many years. For 2010, we have 452 detailed goals with owners, deliverables, and targeted completion dates. These are not the only goals our teams set for themselves, but they are the ones we feel are most important to monitor. None of these goals are easy and many will not be achieved without invention. We review the status of each of these goals several times per year among our senior leadership team and add, remove, and modify goals as we proceed.
A review of our current goals reveals some interesting statistics:
 
 
 
Taken as a whole, the set of goals is indicative of our fundamental approach. Start with customers, and work backwards. Listen to customers, but don't listen to customers  also invent on their behalf. We can't assure you that we'll meet all of this year's goals. We haven't in past years. However, we can assure you that we'll continue to obsess over customers. We have strong conviction that that approach  in the long term  is every bit as good for owners as it is for customers.
just
As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it's still Day 1.
Jeffrey P. Bezos
Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Amazon.com, Inc.
April 2010
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Operating income increased 62% to $394 million in the first quarter, compared with $244 million in first quarter 2009. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, operating income would have grown 56% compared with first quarter 2009.

"We remain heads-down focused on customers," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)January 27, 2011Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010.
Operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.50 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $3.29 billion for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $2.92 billion for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards totaled 465 million on December 31, 2010, compared with 461 million a year ago.
Net sales increased 36% to $12.95 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $9.52 billion in fourth quarter 2009. Excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales would have grown 37% compared with fourth quarter 2009.
Operating income was $474 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $476 million in fourth quarter 2009. The unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter on operating income was $18 million.
Net income increased 8% to $416 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with net income of $384 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2009.
"Thanks to our customers, we achieved two big milestones," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "We had our first $10 billion quarter, and after selling millions of third-generation Kindles with the new Pearl e-ink display during the quarter, Kindle books have now overtaken paperback books as the most popular format on Amazon.com. Last July we announced that Kindle books had passed hardcovers and predicted that Kindle would surpass paperbacks in the second quarter of this year, so this milestone has come even sooner than we expected  and it's on top of continued growth in paperback sales."
Full Year 2010
Net sales increased 40% to $34.20 billion, compared with $24.51 billion in 2009. The unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the year on net sales was $86 million.
Operating income increased 25% to $1.41 billion, compared with $1.13 billion in 2009. The unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the year on operating income was $28 million. In 2009, operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement.
Net income increased 28% to $1.15 billion in 2010, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared with net income of $902 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2009.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 27, 2011. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below
First Quarter 2011 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is www.amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases and social media postings.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
To our shareowners:
Random forests, nave Bayesian estimators, RESTful services, gossip protocols, eventual consistency, data sharding, anti-entropy, Byzantine quorum, erasure coding, vector clocks  walk into certain Amazon meetings, and you may momentarily think you've stumbled into a computer science lecture.
Look inside a current textbook on software architecture, and you'll find few patterns that we don't apply at Amazon. We use high-performance transactions systems, complex rendering and object caching, workflow and queuing systems, business intelligence and data analytics, machine learning and pattern recognition, neural networks and probabilistic decision making, and a wide variety of other techniques. And while many of our systems are based on the latest in computer science research, this often hasn't been sufficient: our architects and engineers have had to advance research in directions that no academic had yet taken. Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions, and so we -- happily -- invent new approaches.
Our technologies are almost exclusively implemented as : bits of logic that encapsulate the data they operate on and provide hardened interfaces as the only way to access their functionality. This approach reduces side effects and allows services to evolve at their own pace without impacting the other components of the overall system. Service-oriented architecture -- or SOA -- is the fundamental building abstraction for Amazon technologies. Thanks to a thoughtful and far-sighted team of engineers and architects, this approach was applied at Amazon long before SOA became a buzzword in the industry. Our e-commerce platform is composed of a federation of hundreds of software services that work in concert to deliver functionality ranging from recommendations to order fulfillment to inventory tracking. For example, to construct a product detail page for a customer visiting Amazon.com, our software calls on between 200 and 300 services to present a highly personalized experience for that customer.
services
State management is the heart of any system that needs to grow to very large size. Many years ago, Amazon's requirements reached a point where many of our systems could no longer be served by any commercial solution: our key data services store many petabytes of data and handle millions of requests per second. To meet these demanding and unusual requirements, we've developed several alternative, purpose-built persistence solutions, including our own key-value store and single table store. To do so, we've leaned heavily on the core principles from the distributed systems and database research communities and invented from there. The storage systems we've pioneered demonstrate extreme scalability while maintaining tight control over performance, availability, and cost. To achieve their ultra-scale properties these systems take a novel approach to data update management: by relaxing the synchronization requirements of updates that need to be disseminated to large numbers of replicas, these systems are able to survive under the harshest performance and availability conditions. These implementations are based on the concept of eventual consistency. The advances in data management developed by Amazon engineers have been the starting point for the architectures underneath the cloud storage and data management services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). For example, our Simple Storage Service, Elastic Block Store, and SimpleDB all derive their basic architecture from unique Amazon technologies.
Other areas of Amazon's business face similarly complex data processing and decision problems, such as product data ingestion and categorization, demand forecasting, inventory allocation, and fraud detection. Rule-based systems can be used successfully, but they can be hard to maintain and can become brittle over time. In many cases, advanced machine learning techniques provide more accurate classification and can self-heal to adapt to changing conditions. For example, our search engine employs data mining and machine learning algorithms that run in the background to build topic models, and we apply information extraction algorithms to identify attributes and extract entities from unstructured descriptions, allowing customers to narrow their searches and quickly find the desired product. We consider a large number of factors in search relevance to predict the probability of a customer's interest and optimize the ranking of results. The diversity of products demands that we employ modern regression techniques like trained random forests of decision trees to flexibly incorporate thousands of product attributes at rank time. The end result of all this behind-the-scenes software? Fast, accurate search results that help you find what you want.
All the effort we put into technology might not matter that much if we kept technology off to the side in some sort of R&D department, but we don't take that approach. Technology infuses all of our teams, all of our processes, our decision-making, and our approach to innovation in each of our businesses. It is deeply integrated into everything we do.
One example is Whispersync, our Kindle service designed to ensure that everywhere you go, no matter what devices you have with you, you can access your reading library and all of your highlights, notes, and bookmarks, all in sync across your Kindle devices and mobile apps. The technical challenge is making this a reality for millions of Kindle owners, with hundreds of millions of books, and hundreds of device types, living in over 100 countries around the worldat 24x7 reliability. At the heart of Whispersync is an eventually consistent replicated data store, with application defined conflict resolution that must and can deal with device isolation lasting weeks or longer. As a Kindle customer, of course, we hide all this technology from you. So when you open your Kindle, it's in sync and on the right page. To paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke, like any sufficiently advanced technology, it's indistinguishable from magic.
Now, if the eyes of some shareowners dutifully reading this letter are by this point glazing over, I will awaken you by pointing out that, in my opinion, these techniques are not idly pursued  they lead directly to free cash flow.
We live in an era of extraordinary increases in available bandwidth, disk space, and processing power, all of which continue to get cheap fast. We have on our team some of the most sophisticated technologists in the world  helping to solve challenges that are right on the edge of what's possible today. As I've discussed many times before, we have unshakeable conviction that the long-term interests of shareowners are perfectly aligned with the interests of customers.
And we like it that way. Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers. We still have a lot to learn, and I expect and hope we'll continue to have so much fun learning it. I take great pride in being part of this team.
As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it's still Day 1.
 
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)July 26, 2011Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Operating cash flow increased 25% to $3.21 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $2.56 billion for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2010. Free cash flow decreased 8% to $1.83 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $1.99 billion for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2010.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards totaled 468 million on June 30, 2011, compared with 465 million a year ago.
Net sales increased 51% to $9.91 billion in the second quarter, compared with $6.57 billion in second quarter 2010. Excluding the $477 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales would have grown 44% compared with second quarter 2010.
Operating income was $201 million in the second quarter, compared with $270 million in second quarter 2010. The favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter on operating income was $28 million.
Net income decreased 8% to $191 million in the second quarter, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with net income of $207 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in second quarter 2010.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 26, 2011. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Third Quarter 2011 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
 
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 31, 2012. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
First Quarter 2012 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings
Our investor relations website is www.amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases and social media postings.

To our shareowners:
 
 
"To us, the value of Amazon Web Services is undeniable  in twenty seconds, we can double our server capacity. In a high-growth environment like ours and with a small team of developers, it's very important for us to trust that we have the best support to give to the music community around the world. Five years ago, we would have crashed and been down without knowing when we would be back. Now, because of Amazon's continued innovation, we can provide the best technology and continue to grow." That's Christopher Tholen, the Chief Technology Officer of BandPage. His comments about how AWS helps with the critical need to scale compute capacity quickly and reliably are not hypothetical: BandPage now helps 500,000 bands and artists connect with tens of millions of fans.
 
"So, I started selling on Amazon in April of 2011, and by the time we became the top Amazon lunchbox seller in June, we had between 50 and 75 orders a day. When we hit August and September  our busiest time, with the start of the school year  we had 300, sometimes 500 orders a day. It was just phenomenal I'm using Amazon to fulfill my orders, which makes my life easier. Plus, when my customers found out they could get free shipping with Prime subscriptions, the lunchboxes began selling like crazy." Kelly Lester is the "mom entrepreneur" of EasyLunchboxes, her own innovative line of easy-to-pack, environmentally friendly lunchbox containers.
 
"I sort of stumbled onto it, and it opened a whole new world for me. Since I had over a thousand [book] titles at my house, I thought, I'll give this a try.' I sold some and I kept expanding it and expanding it, and come to find out this was so much fun I decided I don't ever want to get another job again. And I've got no boss  other than my wife, that is. What could be better than that? We actually work together on this. We both go out hunting, so it's a team effort that's worked out very well. We sell about 700 books a month. We ship between 800 and 900 to Amazon each month and Amazon ships out the 700 that people buy. Without Amazon handling shipping and customer service, my wife and I would have to be running to the post office or someplace every day with dozens of packages. With that part taken care of for us, life is much simpler This is a terrific program and I love it. After all, Amazon supplies the customers and even ships the books. I mean, how can it get better than that?" Bob Frank founded RJF Books and More after getting laid off in the midst of the economic downturn. He and his wife split their time between Phoenix and Minneapolis, and he describes finding the books he sells like "a treasure hunt every day."
 
"Because of Kindle Direct Publishing, I earn more royalties in one month than I ever did in a year of writing for a traditional house. I have gone from worrying about if I will be able to pay the bills  and there were many months when I couldn't  to finally having real savings, even thinking about a vacation; something I haven't done in years Amazon has allowed me to really spread my wings. Prior, I was boxed into a genre, yet I had all of these other books I wanted to write. Now I can do just that. I manage my career. I feel as if I finally have a partner in Amazon. They understand this business and have changed the face of publishing for the good of the writer and the reader, putting choices back into our hands." That's A. K. Alexander, author of , one of the top 100 best-selling Kindle books in March.
Daddy's Home
 
"I had no idea that March of 2010, the first month I decided to publish on KDP, would be a defining moment in my life. Within a year of doing so, I was making enough on a monthly basis to quit my day job and focus on writing full time! The rewards that have sprung out of deciding to publish through KDP have been nothing short of life changing. Financially. Personally. Emotionally. Creatively. The ability to write full time, to be home with my family, and to write exactly what I want without the input of a legacy publisher marketing committee wanting to have a say in every detail of my writing, has made me a stronger writer, a more prolific writer, and most importantly a far happier one. Amazon and KDP are literally enabling creativity in the publishing world and giving writers like me a shot at their dream, and for that I am forever grateful." That's Blake Crouch, author of several thrillers, including the Kindle best seller
Run.
"Amazon has made it possible for authors like me to get their work in front of readers and has changed my life. In a little over a year, I have sold nearly 250,000 books through the Kindle and have traded in old dreams for bigger and better ones. Four of my books have hit the Top 100 Kindle Best Sellers List. Also, I have been approached by agents, foreign sales people, and two movie producers, and have received mentions in the LA Times, Wall Street Journal, and PC Magazine, and was recently interviewed by USA Today. Mostly, I am excited that all writers now have the opportunity to get their work in front of readers without jumping through insurmountable hoops. Writers have more options and readers have more choices. The publishing world is changing fast, and I plan to enjoy every minute of the ride." Theresa Ragan is the KDP author of multiple Kindle best sellers including .
Abducted
 
"Past age 60 and in the midst of the recession, my wife and I found our income options severely limited. KDP was my one shot at a lifelong dream  our only chance at financial salvation. Within months of publishing, KDP has completely changed our lives, enabling this aging nonfiction writer to launch a brand-new career as a best-selling novelist. I can't say enough on behalf of Amazon and the many tools that they make available to independent authors. Without reservation, I urge fellow writers to investigate and seize the opportunities that KDP offers. As I've happily discovered, there is zero downside risk  and the potential is virtually unlimited." Robert Bidinotto is the author of the Kindle best seller .
Hunter: A Thriller
 
"I leveraged KDP's technology to blow through all the traditional gatekeepers. Can you imagine how that feels, after struggling so hard, for so long, for every  single  reader? Now, inspirational fiction lovers I never would have reached are enjoying and my other two novels from the Kindle Store at $2.99. I've always wanted to write a Cinderella story. Now I have. And, thanks to Prince Charming (KDP), there will be more to come" Creston Mapes is the author of the Kindle best seller .

Invention comes in many forms and at many scales. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower to unleash creativity  to pursue dreams. That's a big part of what's going on with Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle Direct Publishing. With AWS, FBA, and KDP, we are creating powerful self-service platforms that allow thousands of people to boldly experiment and accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or impractical. These innovative, large-scale platforms are not zero-sum  they create win-win situations and create significant value for developers, entrepreneurs, customers, authors, and readers.

Amazon Web Services has grown to have thirty different services and thousands of large and small businesses and individual developers as customers. One of the first AWS offerings, the Simple Storage Service, or S3, now holds over 900 billion data objects, with more than a billion new objects being added every day. S3 routinely handles more than 500,000 transactions per second and has peaked at close to a million transactions per second. All AWS services are pay-as-you-go and radically transform capital expense into a variable cost. AWS is self-service: you don't need to negotiate a contract or engage with a salesperson  you can just read the online documentation and get started. AWS services are elastic  they easily scale up and easily scale down.
 
In just the last quarter of 2011, Fulfillment by Amazon shipped tens of millions of items on behalf of sellers. When sellers use FBA, their items become eligible for Amazon Prime, for Super Saver Shipping, and for Amazon returns processing and customer service. FBA is self-service and comes with an easy-to-use inventory management console as part of Amazon Seller Central. For the more technically inclined, it also comes with a set of APIs so that you can use our global fulfillment center network like a giant computer peripheral.
 
I am emphasizing the self-service nature of these platforms because it's important for a reason I think is somewhat non-obvious: even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation. When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there's no expert gatekeeper ready to say "that will never work!" And guess what  many of those improbable ideas do work, and society is the beneficiary of that diversity.
Kindle Direct Publishing has quickly taken on astonishing scale  more than a thousand KDP authors now each sell more than a thousand copies a month, some have already reached hundreds of thousands of sales, and two have already joined the Kindle Million Club. KDP is a big win for authors. Authors who use KDP get to keep their copyrights, keep their derivative rights, get to publish on their schedule  a typical delay in traditional publishing can be a year or more from the time the book is finished  and  saving the best for last  KDP authors can get paid royalties of 70%. The largest traditional publishers pay royalties of only 17.5% on ebooks (they pay 25% of 70% of the selling price which works out to be 17.5% of the selling price). The KDP royalty structure is completely transformative for authors. A typical selling price for a KDP book is a reader-friendly $2.99  authors get approximately $2 of that! With the legacy royalty of 17.5%, the selling price would have to be $11.43 to yield the same $2 per unit royalty. I assure you that authors sell many, many more copies at $2.99 than they would at $11.43.
 
Kindle Direct Publishing is good for readers because they get lower prices, but perhaps just as important, readers also get access to more diversity since authors that might have been rejected by establishment publishing channels now get their chance in the marketplace. You can get a pretty good window into this. Take a look at the Kindle best-seller list, and compare it to the New York Times best-seller list  which is more diverse? The Kindle list is chock-full of books from small presses and self-published authors, while the New York Times list is dominated by successful and established authors.
 
Amazonians are leaning into the future, with radical and transformational innovations that create value for thousands of authors, entrepreneurs, and developers. Invention has become second nature at Amazon, and in my view the team's pace of innovation is even accelerating  I can assure you it's very energizing. I'm extremely proud of the whole team, and feel lucky to have a front row seat.
 
As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it's still Day 1!
 
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 26, 2012, and exclude financial results of the Kiva Systems, Inc. acquisition which we expect to close in second quarter 2012. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Second Quarter 2012 Guidance
 
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

"Amazon Prime is now the best bargain in the history of shopping  that is not hyperbole," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "We successfully launched Prime seven years ago with free unlimited two-day shipping on one million items. The price of annual membership was $79. Since then, Prime selection has grown to 15 million items. We've also added 18,000 movies and TV episodes available for unlimited streaming. And we've added the Kindle Owners' Lending Library  borrow 170,000 books for free with no due dates  it even includes all seven Harry Potter books. What hasn't changed since we launched Prime? The price. It's still $79. We're very grateful to our Prime members, and thank them whole-heartedly for the business and for the word-of-mouth that has made this program grow."

Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)October 25, 2012Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2012.
Operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $3.11 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2011. Free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $1.53 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2011.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards totaled 469 million on September 30, 2012, consistent with 469 million one year ago.
Net sales increased 27% to $13.81 billion in the third quarter, compared with $10.88 billion in third quarter 2011. Excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 30% compared with third quarter 2011.
Operating loss was $28 million in the third quarter, compared with operating income of $79 million in third quarter 2011. The unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter on operating loss was $3 million.
Net loss was $274 million in the third quarter, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with net income of $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in third quarter 2011. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, related to our equity-method share of the losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill.
"Our approach is to work hard to charge less. Sell devices near breakeven and you can pack a lot of sophisticated hardware into a very low price point," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "And our approach is working  the $199 Kindle Fire HD is the #1 bestselling product across Amazon worldwide. Incredibly, this is true even as measured by unit sales. The next two bestselling products worldwide are our Kindle Paperwhite and our $69 Kindle. We're selling more of each of these devices than the #4 bestselling product, book three of the Fifty Shades of Grey series. And we haven't even started shipping our best tablet  the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9" ships November 20."

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of October 25, 2012. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
Fourth Quarter 2012 Guidance
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is www.amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases and social media postings.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(c) To furnish to you a copy of each proposed free writing prospectus to be prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and not to use or refer to any proposed free writing prospectus to which you reasonably object.

(e) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Time of Sale Prospectus is delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(f) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
 
(g) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request; provided that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to so qualify (ii) file any general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it not otherwise so subject.

The Underwriters severally agree to reimburse the Company for its
 
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of Securities hereby in an amount up to $1 million within five Business Days of receipt by the Managers from the Company of a reasonably detailed invoice documenting such expenses.
(j) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the Closing Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company or warrants to purchase or otherwise acquire debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Securities (other than (i) the Securities, (ii) commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business or (iii) securities or warrants permitted with the prior written consent of the Manager identified in Schedule I with the authorization to release this lock-up on behalf of the Underwriters).

7. . Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
Covenants of the Underwriters
8. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (to the extent amended or supplemented by the Company), any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any "road show" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act (a ""), or the
road show
 
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus, road show, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of all indemnified persons in connection with such proceeding, using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and (y) representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (z) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it that are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred, but only after receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice in respect thereof.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b), provided, however, that in either such case, counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the other party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i)in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other
 
hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or
Termination
 
New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause 9, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of the Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of the Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L, 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their clients, which may include the name and address of their clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their clients.
11. . (a)This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
(b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a replacement Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a replacement Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

Every replacement Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section 2.8 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.

If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on the Maturity of Securities of a Series money sufficient to pay such Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities of the Series cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
The Company may purchase or otherwise acquire the Securities, whether by open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.2.

Section 2.11. .
Temporary Securities

Until so exchanged, temporary Securities shall have the same rights under this Indenture as the definitive Securities.
Section 2.12. .

which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense, unless, the Trustee, in its reasonable discretion, determines that any actual or potential conflict of interest may exist, in which case the Trustee may have separate counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.

(b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law,
(c) a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property, or

If the Trustee with respect to the Securities of a Series fails to comply with Section 7.9, any Holder of Securities of such Series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such Series.

Nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. On request of the Company, or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall transfer to such successor Trustee all property held by such retiring Trustee as Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those Series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Such retiring Trustee shall, however, have the right to deduct its unpaid fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)January 29, 2013Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012.

Free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $2.09 billion for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2011.

Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards totaled 470 million on December 31, 2012, compared with 468 million one year ago.
Net sales increased 22% to $21.27 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $17.43 billion in fourth quarter 2011. Excluding the $178 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 23% compared with fourth quarter 2011.

Net loss was $39 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with net income of $631 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2011.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 29, 2013. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.
First Quarter 2013 Guidance
 
 
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
To our shareowners:
As regular readers of this letter will know, our energy at Amazon comes from the desire to impress customers rather than the zeal to best competitors. We don't take a view on which of these approaches is more likely to maximize business success. There are pros and cons to both and many examples of highly successful competitor-focused companies. We do work to pay attention to competitors and be inspired by them, but it is a fact that the customer-centric way is at this point a defining element of our culture.
One advantage  perhaps a somewhat subtle one  of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of proactivity. When we're at our best, we don't wait for external pressures. We are driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to. We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements in customer experience  importantly  even in those areas where we are already the leader.
internally
"Thank you. Every time I see that white paper on the front page of Amazon, I know that I'm about to get more for my money than I thought I would. I signed up for Prime for the shipping, yet now I get movies, and TV and books. You keep adding more, but not charging more. So thanks again for the additions." We now have more than 15 million items in Prime, up 15x since we launched in 2005. Prime Instant Video selection tripled in just over a year to more than 38,000 movies and TV episodes. The Kindle Owners' Lending Library has also more than tripled to over 300,000 books, including an investment of millions of dollars to make the entire series available as part of that selection. We didn't "have to" make these improvements in Prime. We did so proactively. A related investment  a major, multi-year one  is Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA gives third-party sellers the option of warehousing their inventory alongside ours in our fulfillment center network. It has been a game changer for our seller customers because their items become eligible for Prime benefits, which drives their sales, while at the same time benefitting consumers with additional Prime selection.
Harry Potter
We build automated systems that look for occasions when we've provided a customer experience that isn't up to our standards, and those systems then proactively refund customers. One industry observer recently received an automated email from us that said, "We noticed that you experienced poor video playback while watching the following rental on Amazon Video On Demand: Casablanca. We're sorry for the inconvenience and have issued you a refund for the following amount: $2.99. We hope to see you again soon." Surprised by the proactive refund, he ended up writing about the experience: "Amazon noticed that I experienced poor video playback' And they decided to give me a refund because of that? WowTalk about putting customers first."
When you pre-order something from Amazon, we guarantee you the lowest price offered by us between your order time and the end of the day of the release date. "I just received notice of a $5 refund to my credit card for pre-order price protection. . . What a great way to do business! Thank you very much for your fair and honest dealings." Most customers are too busy themselves to monitor the price of an item after they pre-order it, and our policy could be to require the customer to contact us and ask for the refund. Doing it proactively is more expensive for us, but it also surprises, delights, and earns trust.
We also have authors as customers. Amazon Publishing has just announced it will start paying authors their royalties monthly, sixty days in arrears. The industry standard is twice a year, and that has been the standard for a long time. Yet when we interview authors as customers, infrequent payment is a major dissatisfier. Imagine how you'd like it if you were paid twice a year. There isn't competitive pressure to pay authors more than once every six months, but we're proactively doing so. By the way  though the research was taxing, I struggled through and am happy to report that I recently saw many Kindles in use at a Florida beach. There are five generations of Kindle, and I believe I saw every generation in use except for the first. Our business approach is to sell premium hardware at roughly breakeven prices. We want to make money when people use our devices  not when people buy our devices. We think this aligns us better with customers. For example, we don't need our customers to be on the upgrade treadmill. We can be very happy to see people still using four-year-old Kindles!
I can keep going  Kindle Fire's FreeTime, our customer service Andon Cord, Amazon MP3's AutoRip  but will finish up with a very clear example of internally driven motivation: Amazon Web Services. In 2012, AWS announced 159 new features and services. We've reduced AWS prices 27 times since launching 7 years ago, added enterprise service support enhancements, and created innovative tools to help customers be more efficient. AWS Trusted Advisor monitors customer configurations, compares them to known best practices, and then notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance, enhance security, or save money. Yes, we are actively telling customers they're paying us more than they need to. In the last 90 days, customers have saved millions of dollars through Trusted Advisor, and the service is only getting started. All of this progress comes in the context of AWS being the widely recognized leader in its area  a situation where you might worry that external motivation could fail. On the other hand, internal motivation  the drive to get the customer to say "Wow"  keeps the pace of innovation fast.
Our heavy investments in Prime, AWS, Kindle, digital media, and customer experience in general strike some as too generous, shareholder indifferent, or even at odds with being a for-profit company. "Amazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers," writes one outside observer. But I don't think so. To me, trying to dole out improvements in a just-in-time fashion would be too clever by half. It would be risky in a world as fast-moving as the one we all live in. More fundamentally, I think long-term thinking squares the circle. Proactively delighting customers earns trust, which earns more business from those customers, even in new business arenas. Take a long-term view, and the interests of customers and shareholders align.
As I write this, our recent stock performance has been positive, but we constantly remind ourselves of an important point  as I frequently quote famed investor Benjamin Graham in our employee all-hands meetings  "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." We don't celebrate a 10% increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience. We aren't 10% smarter when that happens and conversely aren't 10% dumber when the stock goes the other way. We want to be weighed, and we're always working to build a heavier company.
As proud as I am of our progress and our inventions, I know that we will make mistakes along the way  some will be self-inflicted, some will be served up by smart and hard-working competitors. Our passion for pioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages, and, unavoidably, many will turn out to be blind alleys. But  with a bit of good fortune  there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues.
I am incredibly lucky to be a part of this large team of outstanding missionaries who value our customers as much as I do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it's still Day 1.
 
 
 
To our shareholders:
 
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.
 
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
 
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
 
It's All About the Long Term
 
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the . This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
long term
 
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.
 
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the "right" investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
 
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.
 
Obsess Over Customers
 
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM
shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
 
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure
 
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:
 
 
 
 
 
Our Employees
 
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
 
It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three"), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
 
Goals for 1998
 
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.
 
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we've long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it's likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we've done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
 
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, are a necessary component of ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt, obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
"Return on Invested Capital" is a ratio based on free cash flow, and as such, is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average "Total assets" minus "Current liabilities" (excluding the current portion, if any, of our Long-Term Debt), over the most recent five quarter ends. We believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently.
As with free cash flow, return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. We include return on invested capital, and the denominator used to calculate it (called "Invested Capital") in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar in "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
