Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- April 23, 2003 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and services to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $53.8 million for the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 11% over $48.4 million in the first quarter of 2002, and a decrease of 1% from $54.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company's net loss narrowed to $1.6 million during the quarter, which represents a 41% improvement from the $2.7 million loss in the first quarter of 2002, and a 12% improvement from the $1.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2002. Loss per fully diluted share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2003 improved from the loss of $0.09 in the first quarter of 2002, and the loss of $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gene Banucci, Chief Executive Officer, said, "This was an unusual quarter for the Company in that January and February were weaker than expected, while March was much stronger. Similarly, we believe wafer starts were modestly positive during the quarter, but weak in February and strong in March. Worldwide, we believe wafer starts were up approximately 2% sequentially for the quarter, with wafer starts in Taiwan up between 8-10% sequentially solely on the basis of a strong March." Doug Neugold, ATMI President, said, "We continued to make excellent inroads with key customers during the quarter; our commitment to global key account support teams is creating a measurable difference in our performance with our key customers. This investment -- along with the manufacturing and technology development investments we have made throughout this downturn -- has created numerous new opportunities for
ATMI. One example, our new NOWTrak(R) radio-frequency materials identification and tracking product, has moved into production. In beta testing, our customers have been enthusiastic with the material use optimization and process efficiency enhancement that NOWTrak(R) provides them. Besides this new product technology, ATMI's Packaging group has had key wins for our NOWPak(R) and SmartProbe(R) products in China and other Asia/Pacific markets, opening up new opportunities to spread this industry standard product." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "As Gene indicated, we had a `down and up' quarter which ultimately resulted in an overall flat quarter sequentially. We remain very focused on cost containment and operating efficiency, and we believe we are in a strong financial position to respond to the anticipated recovery." During the quarter, ATMI's Materials segment produced revenues of $36.2 million, or approximately 67% of ATMI's total revenues. Materials revenues increased 24% from $29.2 million during the first quarter of 2002, but declined 2% from $36.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross profit margins were 49.3%, compared with 50.5% for the same quarter last year, and 51.5% for the fourth quarter of 2002. Revenues in the Technologies segment were $17.6 million, down 8% from $19.1 million for the first quarter last year, and up 1% from $17.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross margins were 25.2%, compared with 23.9% in the first quarter last year and 16.5% for the fourth quarter of 2002, as equipment spares and increased volume in our Epitaxial Services business helped incrementally improve gross margins. In the first quarter of 2003, gross margins were negatively affected by the incremental depreciation and fixed cost structure of our new materials manufacturing facility in Burnet, Texas and positively affected by some high margin, previously deferred revenue. Also during the quarter, ATMI completed its exit from the gallium arsenide
epitaxial services business and recouped a modest amount of the provision made in the third quarter of 2002. There was a restructuring charge in the quarter, related to the closing of a parts cleaning facility in Colorado Springs. Together, these items had a positive pre-tax effect of $340,000 for the quarter. ATMI provides specialty materials, and related equipment and services, to the worldwide semiconductor industry.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release ATMI ACQUIRES ESC, INC. Novel Copper and Advanced Interconnect Cleaning Materials DANBURY, CT-- July 14, 2003-- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and services to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced the acquisition of ESC, Inc. of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. ESC produces novel surface preparation and cleaning materials for copper and advanced interconnect microelectronic fabrication processes. Gene Banucci, ATMI CEO, said, "ATMI has been investing heavily in copper and advanced interconnect materials. A key step in advanced interconnect processing is surface preparation and cleaning, especially post CMP processing. ESC has a series of patent protected products that provide the unique wafer cleaning capabilities that copper processing requires. We believe this acquisition will provide ATMI with a capability that amplifies our presence in both copper materials and CMP." Shahri Naghshineh, President of ESC, said, "Precision surface preparation and cleaning are now critical steps in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. ESC delivers enabling, value added cleaning solutions designed to increase the process yield for the most advanced semiconductor fabrication processes. By combining ESC's surface preparation products and expertise and ATMI's extensive copper and advanced interconnect support suites, we ease the path for copper metallization and low-k dielectric processes to become mainstream fabrication processes." Dan Sharkey, CFO of ATMI, said, "Although immediately accretive, ATMI does not expect that the ESC acquisition will add materially to its financial results in 2003. Detailed terms of the deal will not be announced." About ESC ESC, Inc. began selling its first product in 1999. From there it has expanded its semiconductor process cleaning materials offerings to encompass solutions for the most advanced semiconductor production processes.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS Revenues Up 7% from First Quarter DANBURY, CT -- July 23, 2003 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and services to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today reported revenue of $57.5 million and a net loss of $2.8 million for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2003. The Company reported revenue of $57.8 million and a net loss of $1.0 million for the second quarter a year earlier, and revenue of $53.8 million, and a net loss of $1.6 million, in the first quarter of 2003. Loss per fully diluted share was $0.09 in the second quarter of 2003, compared with the loss per share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2002, and the loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2003. Loss per share for the second quarter of 2003 includes $0.06 of special charges, primarily related to an adjustment to mark the value of the Company's venture investment portfolio to market. Loss per share in the second quarter of 2002 included $0.02 for an inventory write down in the Company's Emosyn smart card venture. For the six months ended June 30, revenues were $111.3 million, an increase of nearly 5% compared with $106.2 million for the first half of 2002. The net loss was $4.4 million, or $0.15 per share compared with $3.7 million, or $0.12 loss per share in 2002's first six months. Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Taiwan showed significant wafer start strength through the second quarter, which helped sales in several of ATMI's materials product lines. The US, European, and other Asian markets also showed signs of strength, driving global wafer starts up sequentially by slightly greater than 5%. We expect the rate of Taiwanese wafer starts growth to moderate; however the rest of the world should show stronger growth than this past quarter." Doug Neugold, President said, "During, and just after the quarter, ATMI made two strategic deals that further solidify our position as the source of semiconductor process efficiency for advanced interconnect processes. We entered into a strategic partnership with Enthone, purchasing the rights to -99-1-
their copper electrochemical deposition product line and adding it to our industry-leading copper process suite. We also announced the acquisition of ESC, a leader in copper cleaning materials technologies. I don't believe there is any other company that can offer such supportive breadth and depth for copper materials processing in the semiconductor industry." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "We were closer to operating breakeven this quarter, although our Technologies segment -- based largely on the still-muted capital spending cycle -- still hasn't shown the growth prospects that our Materials segment continues to deliver. All else being equal, chances are good that, with continued revenue growth in our Materials segment and the successful integration of our two new product offerings, ATMI's return to profitability is near. Most of the reduction in cash on our balance sheet is a result of our agreement to purchase the rights to Enthone's copper ECD materials and our ongoing alliance with them in product development. Because the effective date of the deal was so late in the quarter, there wasn't any significant effect on the income statement." During the quarter, ATMI's Materials segment produced revenues of $39.4 million, or approximately 69% of ATMI's total revenues. Materials revenues increased 9% from $36.3 million during the second quarter of 2002, and increased 9% from $36.2 million in the first quarter of 2003. Gross profit margins were 50.5%, compared with 51.6% for the same quarter last year, and 49.3% for the first quarter of 2003, based predominantly on product sales mix. Revenues in the Technologies segment were $18.0 million, down 16% from $21.5 million for the second quarter last year, but up 2% from $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. Gross margins were 20.6%, compared with 22.7% in the second quarter last year, and 25.2% for the first quarter of 2003, which was boosted with the one-time recognition of certain deferred revenue and cost recoveries in the first quarter. ATMI provides specialty materials, and related equipment and services, to the worldwide semiconductor industry. As the Source of Semiconductor Process Efficiency, ATMI helps customers improve wafer yields and lower operating costs. For more information, please visit atmi.com. -99-2-

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release ATMI Reports Third Quarter Financial Results DANBURY, CT -- October 22, 2003 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today reported revenues of $58.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003. Revenues increased 1% from $57.5 million in the preceding quarter, and 12% from revenues of $52.1 million in the third quarter of 2002. Net loss for the quarter was $10.8 million, or $0.36 per share, as compared with a $2.8 million loss, or $0.09 per share, in the preceding quarter, and a net loss of $25.2 million, or $0.84 per share, in the third quarter of 2002. Loss per share for the third quarter of 2003 includes special charges of $0.26, including $6.7 million of cost of sales related to inventory write-downs primarily for outsourcing and standardization of our equipment product lines; $3.0 million mainly associated with planned facilities closures; and $2.2 million of other expense for impairment of a venture investment. The loss per share for the third quarter of 2002 included a $0.74 charge for costs associated with the disposition of our gallium arsenide business. For the nine months ended September 30, revenues were $169.4 million, an increase of 7% compared with $158.2 million for the first nine months of 2002. The net loss was $15.2 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with $28.9 million, or $0.97 loss per share in 2002's first nine months. -more-
ATMI Reports Third Quarter Financial Results -- Page 2 Doug Neugold, President and Chief Operating Officer, said: "We continue to have good momentum in our advanced interconnect-oriented products -- including copper plating, chemical vapor deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, and cleans products and services. Our implant and packaging products maintained their leading market positions. Our key customers' activity levels support industry observations that capacity is tight at the 130 nanometer and lower technology nodes. Overall, however, our materials revenues did not meet our expectations, notably in Taiwan, the result of converting a distribution relationship to direct sales for a key product line. This situation has been resolved since our former distributor's inventory is now depleted. Furthermore, we expect that the continued strength in Taiwan wafer starts we are witnessing will translate to accelerating revenues and margins for this product line." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer, said: "During the quarter, ATMI's Materials segment produced revenues of $41.7 million, or approximately 72% of ATMI's total revenues. Materials' revenues increased 28% from $32.5 million in the third quarter of 2002, and increased 6% sequentially from $39.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Materials' gross profit margins were 39.2% in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding the special charges in the third quarter of 2003, gross margins were 45.7%, compared with 48.3% for the same quarter last year, and 50.5% for the second quarter of 2003, based predominantly on product sales mix." Sharkey continued, "Revenues in the Technologies segment were $16.4 million, down 16% from $19.6 million for the third quarter last year, and down 9% from $18.0 million in the second quarter of 2003. Technologies' gross margins were
ATMI Reports Third Quarter Financial Results -- Page 3 negative 8.3% in the third quarter of 2003, and were 4.2% in the third quarter of 2002. Excluding the special charges in the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, gross margins were 16.4% and 20.0%, respectively, and 20.6% for the second quarter of 2003." "We have significant size and technological leadership in specialty materials that should allow ATMI to capture a major share of the largest growth opportunities in semiconductors -- especially those associated with advanced interconnect production," said Gene Banucci, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. "On the other hand, our Technologies businesses suffer from a lack of critical mass in manufacturing and service. Therefore, we are determined to reduce our exposure to our Technologies businesses and to reallocate those resources to our core materials and materials packaging businesses." Banucci continued, "The Technologies businesses range from those that are clearly non-core businesses, like our Emosyn Smart Card enterprise, and those product lines that support our core materials business, such as environmental equipment. Our objective is to exit our non-core businesses by outright sale or joint venture. Where possible, we plan to use partnerships, joint ventures, and alliances to generate critical mass for our supporting product lines. We intend to complete these initiatives before the end of 2004."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI UPDATES FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK DANBURY, CT - January 8, 2004 - ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and services to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced that it anticipates fourth quarter revenues will be approximately $73 million, which represents sequential growth of greater than 25% over the third quarter. Because of this growth, ATMI expects to be profitable from operations during the quarter. In addition, the Company will record a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.10 per share, resulting from the favorable resolution of a United States Tax Court claim. Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "During the quarter, the Company experienced strength in all its product lines, especially those associated with advanced interconnect production. The fourth quarter reflects the recovery from a shortfall in third quarter revenue caused by a distributor termination for a key product line. ATMI will report 2003 fourth quarter and full year results on February 4th, at which time more detail will be provided." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continue to make progress on the divestment/partnering of our Technologies segment businesses. Given these intentions, virtually all the businesses formerly in that segment will be accounted for, and reported as, Discontinued Operations effective in the fourth quarter, and going forward. Revenues from the businesses that will be associated with our continuing operations should be approximately $52 million for the fourth quarter, sequentially up 23% from $42.2 million in the third quarter."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2003 RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- February 4, 2004 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter, and for the year 2003. Consistent with the January 8, 2004 pre-announcement, for the first time, results are reported for continuing and discontinued operations. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 Revenues from continuing operations were $52.4 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% sequentially from the third quarter, and 41% greater than the fourth quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $5.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, which includes a $0.03 per share charge for an investment write-down and a one-time $0.10 per share tax benefit. In the third quarter of 2003, continuing operations generated a loss of $4.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, which included special charges of $0.17 per share. In the fourth quarter of last year, income from continuing operations was $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Including discontinued operations, total revenues would have been reported at $74.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 27% sequentially from the third quarter, and 36% greater than the fourth quarter of last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $5.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, which includes the net effect of special items previously mentioned, and a $0.01 loss from discontinued operations. Net loss was $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2003, or $0.36 per diluted share, which included a loss from discontinued operations, including special charges, of $0.19 per share. For the fourth quarter of last year, net loss was $1.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. RESULTS FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 2003 For 2003, revenues from continuing operations were $171.6 million, up 25% from $137.0 million in 2002. Income from continuing operations was $2.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, including a $0.12 per share net charge for special items during 2003 consisting of the one-time tax benefit, offset by the investment write-down, and other special charges recognized in the previous quarters of this past year. In 2002, income from continuing operations was $1.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, after $0.01 per share of special items. Including discontinued operations, revenues were $243.4 million in 2003, up 14.5% from $212.6 million in 2002. Net loss was $9.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, after $0.18 per share of special items during the year. That compares with $30.7 million in 2002, or $0.99 per diluted share, after $0.71 per share of special items during the year. COMMENTS Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Clearly, we are pleased that the long anticipated semiconductor industry turnaround is upon us. Over the last two and a half years of downturn, we've worked hard to reposition the Company as a consistently profitable growth enterprise. Given our wafer start forecast of a 9% to 11% increase for 2004, we expect the coming year to further validate our growth model. Although we anticipate capital equipment expenditures to grow substantially during the year, probably in excess of 40%, we intend to continue the transformation of ATMI, with the sale of non-strategic assets." Doug Neugold, ATMI President, said "During the quarter, all of our continuing product lines experienced good growth. Although we believe there was some catch-up from a slow third quarter, products pertaining specifically to copper deposition and cleaning grew substantially -- between 30% and 60%. We've been working to shift ATMI's entire materials and packaging products portfolio toward advanced interconnect applications. Our most recent analysis tells us they now account for over 30% of our quarterly continuing operations revenues, up from approximately 5% in the fourth quarter of 2002." 99-1
Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "As a result of our decision to exit nearly all our Technologies businesses, ATMI's financials will be bifurcated into continuing (essentially our former Materials segment) and discontinued (essentially our former Technologies segment) operations. The process of divesting or partnering our Technologies businesses is well underway, however, we have no specific transactions to report at this time. Our goal is to have total focus on our wafer start-driven semiconductor materials product lines by the end of 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 ------------ For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI SELLS GALLIUM NITRIDE BUSINESS TO CREE DANBURY, CT -- March 25, 2004 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its gallium nitride substrates and epitaxy business to Cree, Inc. of Durham, North Carolina, subject to customary closing conditions and certain third party approvals. Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer said, "The sale of our gallium nitride business is the first element of the planned disposition of ATMI's six Technologies businesses. We feel very good about the results of this process for several reasons. It's a good deal for ATMI strategically, and it's probably an even better deal for Cree. As importantly, the employees of our gallium nitride business believed that Cree would be a great home for the business, and we are gratified that we were able to make this a reality." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "This is a cash deal, which represents a modest premium over book value. We will recognize the gain for this disposition of a discontinued operation upon closing, which we expect to happen in the next couple of weeks."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI Reports First Quarter Financial Results DANBURY, CT -- April 21, 2004 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $56.0 million for the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 51% from $37.0 million in the first quarter of 2003, and an increase of 7% over $52.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Continuing operations in the first quarter generated income of $4.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. In the first quarter of last year, income from continuing operations was $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2003, continuing operations generated income of $5.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, which included a one-time $0.10 per share tax benefit and a $0.03 per share charge for an investment write-down. Overall, net income for the first quarter was $6.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, which includes $0.04 per share from activities of discontinued operations, and a gain of $0.03 per share related to the sale of the gallium nitride business. For the first quarter of 2003, net loss was $1.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, which included a loss of $0.08 per share from discontinued operations. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $5.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, which included a $0.01 per share loss from discontinued operations and the one-time tax benefit of $0.10 per share, partially offset by the $0.03 per share investment write-down. Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "The semiconductor industry continued to grow strongly during the first quarter. We believe overall worldwide wafer starts were up, on the order of 3-4% sequentially, with growth rates in Taiwan exceeding 7%. We expect continued industry growth in the second quarter, and believe that growth in wafer starts for the year will come in slightly above our previous range of 9-11%." Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Operating Officer, said, "The first quarter showed broad-based strength. SDS(R) sub-atmospheric gas storage and delivery and materials packaging product sales were strong. Overall gross margin didn't reach the levels we wanted during the quarter because of additional costs to expedite product deliveries to Taiwan on stronger than expected demand, combined with costs related to scaling manufacturing on certain new products. We anticipate improving gross margin levels in the second half. In the copper materials market, our ST-250 post-etch stripping product appears to be gaining traction worldwide. So much so, we are already preparing capacity expansions for this, and related, product lines." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "During the quarter, we completed the first divestiture of our businesses held for sale, with the sale of our Gallium Nitride business to Cree for $10.25 million in cash. With buyer interest in the remaining businesses quite high, negotiations on a number of the other discontinued businesses are well underway." ATMI provides specialty materials and materials packaging to the worldwide semiconductor industry. For more information, please visit atmi.com.

Business and the Assets and to assist Purchaser in exercising all rights with respect thereto, and otherwise to cause Seller to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the Operative Agreements. (b) Effective on the Closing Date, Seller hereby constitutes and appoints Purchaser the true and lawful attorney of Seller, with full power of substitution, in the name of Seller, but on behalf of and for the benefit of Purchaser, solely to the extent related to exercising all rights of ownership and control of the Business and Assets. Seller acknowledges that the appointment hereby made and the powers hereby granted are coupled with an interest and are not and shall not be revocable by it in any manner or for any reason. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at Closing an acknowledged power of attorney to the foregoing effect. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any negligence or breach of Law by Purchaser in its exercise of such power of attorney.

Any information obtained by any Party in accordance with this paragraph shall be held confidential by such Party in accordance with Section 14.6. (e) At the Closing, the Parties shall enter into an administrative services agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G.

ARTICLE IX RISK OF LOSS 9.1 Risk of Loss. Through the Closing Date, all risk of loss or damage to the Assets shall be borne by Seller, and thereafter shall be borne by Purchaser. If any portion of the Assets is destroyed or damaged on or prior to the Closing Date, other than use, wear or loss in the ordinary course of the Business, Seller shall give written notice to Purchaser as soon as practicable after, but in any event within five (5) calendar days of, discovery of such damage or destruction, the amount of insurance covering such Assets and the amount which Seller is otherwise entitled to receive as a consequence. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall have the option, which shall be exercised by written notice to Seller as soon as practicable prior to the Closing Date, of (a) accepting such Assets in their destroyed or damaged condition in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to the proceeds of any insurance or other proceeds payable with respect to such loss and to indemnification for any uninsured portion of such loss, and the full Purchase Price shall be paid for such Assets; or (b) only if the lost or damaged Assets exceed $150,000 in value, excluding such Assets from this Agreement, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount allocated to such Assets, as mutually agreed between the Parties. If Purchaser accepts such Assets, then after the Closing, any insurance or other proceeds shall belong, and shall be assigned to, Purchaser. ARTICLE X EMPLOYEE MATTERS 10.1 Employee Matters. (a) Seller shall provide to Purchaser an updated list of Employees (including any Employees then on leave pursuant to applicable Laws) at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall offer employment commencing immediately following the Closing Date to all Employees on substantially the same terms as such Employee is employed by Seller immediately prior to the Closing but allowing Purchaser to adjust such terms consistent with Purchaser's benefit programs available to employees generally. Each Employee who accepts such an employment offer shall be referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." Purchaser shall not assume any of the Benefit Plans or any liability under or in respect of any of the Benefit Plans. 36
(b) Seller shall be solely responsible for and shall pay all salaries and other compensation (including, but not limited to, any deferred or incentive compensation, and any severance pay) which will or may become payable to any of the Transferred Employees in respect of any period of employment with Seller prior to the Closing Date. (c) Purchaser does not and shall not assume any obligations or liabilities under any collective bargaining agreement currently in effect or which may come into existence. (d) Any notification required under any Law governing mass layoffs or terminations with respect to the termination of Employees from Seller due to the transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation the WARN Act, shall be given by Seller. Compliance with all such Laws with respect to the period preceding the Closing Date shall be Seller's responsibility and liability. Subject to Section 12.3, each of ATMI and Epitronics, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from and against all liabilities, claims and causes of action (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal costs and expenses) arising out of the violation, or alleged violation, of any such Laws. (e) Seller shall have the responsibility to make COBRA continuation coverage available to all Employees and their eligible dependents, covered under the Seller's group health plan, who experiences a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) prior to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent required by Law. (f) To the extent applicable, the Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one another to effect the transition, as of the Closing, of the Transferred Employees from Seller's employee benefit plans and programs to the Purchaser's employee benefit plans and programs. (g) Purchaser shall recognize (i) all accrued but untaken vacation, sick and personal days as of the Closing Date of the Transferred Employees (identified as paid time off under Section 2.2(a)(iv)), and (ii) except for participation in the Purchaser's stock purchase plan, all service with Seller rendered by the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under any plan or program of the Purchaser in which Transferred Employees become eligible to participate. (h) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to effectuate, to the extent elected by participants, the distribution and a direct rollover to Purchaser's qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code ("Purchaser's 401(k) Plan") of each Transferred Employee's account balance, including any outstanding plan loans, in the qualified plan of Seller ("Seller's 401(k) Plan"), in accordance with the terms of Seller's 401(k) Plan and applicable law. In lieu of the rollover of any plan loan, Purchaser may arrange for a bridge loan to an applicable Transferred Employee to enable such Transferred Employee to repay the loan from Seller's 401(k) Plan and then obtain a corresponding loan from Purchaser's 401(k) Plan. 37
10.2 Efforts Regarding Employment. Seller will make all reasonable efforts to cause the Employees who shall be offered employment with Purchaser to remain with the Business during the period up to the Closing Date. In this regard, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser on a timely basis to establish and implement such measures as Purchaser may determine are necessary or desirable in order to effectively transition the employment of those Employees offered employment with the Business of Purchaser following the Closing. ARTICLE XI SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS 11.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. Notwithstanding any right of Purchaser to investigate the Business or any right of any Party to investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other contained in this Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing until (i) with respect to representations and warranties, except for the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.9, 3.12, 3.15 and 3.21, two (2) years after the Closing Date, and (ii) with respect to the covenants and agreements, and the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.9, 3.12, 3.15 and 3.21, expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation, including all periods of extension, except that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate hereunder will continue to survive if a claim for indemnification shall have been delivered not later than ninety (90) days after such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved. ARTICLE XII INDEMNIFICATION 12.1 Tax Indemnification. ATM and Epitronics, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from and against the entirety of any Taxes which ATM or Epitronics is responsible for or required to pay under any provision of this Agreement and any Taxes that are Retained Liabilities, and also from and against any Losses that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may suffer resulting from, arising out of, or caused by any liability of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any such Taxes; and any liability of ATM or Epitronics for Taxes of any person other than ATM or Epitronics (not including Purchaser or any Person who is an Affiliate of Purchaser), whether (A) under Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract, or (D) otherwise; and any liability for Taxes which would not be owed if all warranties and representations of ATM or Epitronics hereunder had been true, complete and correct in all respects. Notwithstanding Section 12.2(e) and (f) (but subject to the remainder of this Section 12.1), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have sole control of any audit or examination of any Tax Return filed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and any related administrative appeal or litigation relating to Taxes (a "Tax Contest"), including the right to pursue or forego any Tax 38
Contest or continuation thereof; provided, however, that the Purchaser's counsel shall consult in good faith with the Seller's counsel in connection with any Tax Contest and shall keep such counsel reasonably informed regarding such Tax Contest. Any indemnification pursuant hereto shall also include reasonable costs incurred by Purchaser (including reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, accountants and expert witnesses) in connection with such indemnification claim. Any indemnification payable by Seller pursuant hereto shall be paid within the later of fifteen (15) days of the Purchaser's request therefor and five (5) days prior to the date on which the liability upon which the indemnification is based is required to be satisfied. The Purchaser agrees promptly to notify the Seller in writing of a proposed adjustment in respect of Taxes that could give rise to an obligation of Seller to indemnify Purchaser under this Section 12.1; provided, however, that the failure of Purchaser to give the notice promptly as required by this Section 12.1 shall not affect the Purchaser's rights under this Section 12 except to the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the Sellers. If, (i) within 30 days after receipt of such notice the Seller shall request that the Purchaser contest such proposed adjustment and (ii) there is a reasonable basis under applicable Laws for pursuing a Tax Contest with respect to the proposed adjustment and Purchaser will not by reason of such Tax Contest incur any penalties or additions to Tax other than in the nature of interest (and, in the case of an appeal from an adverse determination by a court, including the United States Tax Court or a corresponding or similar state governmental authority, there is substantial authority for believing that such adverse determination will be reversed or substantially modified upon appeal in a manner favorable to the taxpayer) the Purchaser shall pursue a Tax Contest with respect to such proposed adjustment in the forum of the Purchaser's choosing, considering, however, in good faith such requests as the Seller shall make concerning the most appropriate forum in which to proceed and other matters related to such Tax Contest. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be required to pursue any Tax Contest unless (x) the Seller shall have agreed in writing to pay and shall pay the Purchaser on demand all reasonable costs and expenses that the Purchaser shall incur in connection with contesting such proposed adjustment, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', accountants' and investigatory fees and disbursements, (y) the proposed adjustment could result in a payment by the Sellers (not including any interest, penalties and additions to Tax that could be imposed with respect to all such adjustments), of at least $25,000, and (z) if the Purchaser shall determine to pay the Tax proposed and sue for a refund, the Seller shall advance to the Purchaser on an interest free basis and with no additional net after-Tax cost to the Purchaser sufficient funds to pay the Tax and interest, penalties and additions to Tax payable with respect thereto. Nothing contained in this Section 12.1 shall require (i) the Purchaser to contest a proposed adjustment that it would otherwise be required to contest if the Purchaser (A) waives the payment by the Sellers of any amount that might otherwise be payable by the Seller under this Agreement by way of indemnity in respect of such proposed adjustment and (B) pays to the Sellers any amount of Taxes, interest, penalties and additions to Tax previously paid or advanced by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such proposed adjustment, or (ii) the Purchaser to pursue any appeal without substantial authority for such appeal or to pursue any appeal to the United States Supreme Court with or without substantial authority for such appeal. 12.2 Other Indemnification. (a) By ATM and Epitronics. Subject to Section 12.3, each of ATM and Epitronics, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties 39
in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach by Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement; (ii) any and all Retained Liabilities; (iii) all obligations and liabilities of whatsoever kind, nature or description relating to product warranty, product liability, litigation or claims against Purchaser or Seller in connection with, arising out of, or relating to products or services sold or shipped by the Business prior to the Closing; (iv) the presence, or any applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority requirements relating to the disposal or arranging for disposal, either on-site or off-site, or the release on or prior to the Closing, of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, or from any of the Assets in violation of any applicable Environmental Law or which require remediation under applicable Environmental Laws or any violation of any applicable Environmental Law that occurs on or prior to the Closing in, on, under, upon or from any of the Assets, or which otherwise applies to the activities at the Assets in each case prior to Closing including without limitation any environmental claim and the defense thereof; provided, that in respect of Losses requiring remediation, Sellers (A) shall be liable solely to the extent required to remediate to the standard of Environmental Law (or as applicable to any agreed-upon settlement or any Order arising from any Environmental Claim) and in a commercially reasonable and cost-effective manner designed to minimize any disruption to the Business, and (B) subject to clause (A), shall have the right to control such remediation (but shall consult with Purchaser); (v) * * *; and (vi) any claim that the Intellectual Property * * * infringes or violates, or constitutes a misuse or misappropriation of, any intellectual property rights of any Person or entity; provided, however, that this clause (vi) shall only be operative for claims brought by Purchaser within three and one-half years following Closing. (b) By Purchaser. Subject to Section 12.3, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (ii) any and all Assumed Liabilities or (iii) except for such matters that constitute a breach of Seller's representations or warranties under this Agreement or are subject to Seller's covenants or 40
obligations of indemnification under this Agreement or are Excluded Liabilities, the operation of the Business after the Closing. (c) Notice of Claims for Indemnity. Whenever a claim for Losses shall arise, the Party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing as soon as practicable following discovery or notice of such claim, (a "Claim Notice") and in any event within such period as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Party to take appropriate action to resist such claim. Such Claim Notice shall specify all material facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnity rights. Failure to give such notice shall not abrogate or diminish the Indemnifying Party's obligation under this Section 12.2 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such claim. (d) Claims Between the Parties. Upon receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice with respect to a claim by the Indemnified Party directly against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Claim Notice setting forth such request for indemnification, either (i) agree in writing to such indemnification request or (ii) if the Indemnifying Party believes in good faith that it is not obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, provide the Indemnified Party with written notice setting forth the basis for such objection in reasonable detail. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to the Indemnified Party's Claim Notice within such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, as set forth in the Claim Notice shall be deemed agreed to by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party timely objects, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall meet and attempt to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations. If they are unable to resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days of delivery of the Indemnifying Party's written objection, such dispute shall be settled in accordance with Section 14.12. (e) Indemnification with Respect to Third Party Claims. Upon receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice with respect to any claim of a third party against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, either (i) agree in writing to assume the defense of such third party claim or (ii) if the Indemnifying Party believes in good faith that it is not obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such third party claim, provide the Indemnified Party with written notice setting forth the basis for such objection in reasonable detail. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to the Claim Notice within such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, shall be deemed agreed to by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party timely objects to the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall meet and attempt to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations. If they are unable to resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days of delivery of the Indemnifying Party's written objection, such dispute shall be settled in accordance with Section 14.12. If it is determined that the Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such third party claim with counsel reasonably 41
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate to the extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith. (f) Conduct of Defense. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any such third party claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any such claim; provided, however, that, to the extent that such settlement involves more than the payment of money, including without limitation requiring the Indemnified Party to take, or prohibiting the Indemnified Party from taking, any action, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any third party claim for which it is obligated to provide indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense of such claim through counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's reasonable expense and shall have control over the litigation and authority to resolve such claim. If action is required to be taken with respect to any third party claim prior to the determination of the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder, the Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense of such claim through counsel of its own choice until such time as the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder are determined. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable hereunder for any settlement of such claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 12.3 Limitations on Indemnification. (a) Except as provided in Section 12.3(c), the indemnification in favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (i) shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnified Losses exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) ("Seller's Threshold Amount"), and (ii) shall terminate once the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnified Losses aggregates the Purchase Price actually received by Seller, and Seller shall thereafter have no further obligations or liabilities with respect to any such Losses. (b) The indemnification in favor of the Seller Indemnified Parties (i) shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnified Losses exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) ("Purchaser's Threshold Amount"), and (ii) shall terminate once the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnified Losses aggregates the Purchase Price actually received by Seller and Purchaser shall thereafter have no further obligations or liabilities with respect to any such Losses; provided however, this limitation shall not be applicable to Purchaser's obligation to pay the Purchase Price . (c) The limitations of indemnification set forth in Section 12.3(a) shall not apply to claims for indemnification (i) under Section 12.1, (ii) for breach of any representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.9 and 3.21, and (iii) * * *. 42
(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, other than injunctive or other non-monetary or equitable relief, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims arising under this Agreement, (whether in contract, statute, tort, including negligence or otherwise) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XII, other than Purchaser's obligation to pay the Purchase Price. (e) The Parties shall use good faith efforts to mitigate the amount of any and all Losses that may be indemnifiable under this Agreement. (f) International Rectifier Corporation, the parent corporation of Purchaser, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the obligations of Purchaser under this Article XII.

If this Agreement is validly terminated, this Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of either Party, except as provided in this Section and except that Sections 14.4, 14.6, 14.12, 14.15, and 14.17 will continue to apply following any such termination. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(b) or (c), each Party will remain liable to the other Party for any breach of this Agreement existing at the time of such termination, and either Party may seek such remedies, including damages and fees of attorneys, against the other with respect to any such breach as are provided in this Agreement or as are otherwise available at Law or in equity. 43

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS DANBURY, CT-- July 21, 2004-- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $61.0 million for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 52.5% from $40.0 million in the second quarter of 2003, and an increase of 8.9% over $56.0 million in the first quarter of 2004. Continuing operations in the second quarter generated income of $5.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. In the second quarter of 2003, income from continuing operations was $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, including a $2.2 million pre-tax asset impairment charge related to the Company's strategic investment portfolio and a $0.4 million charge related to transitioning product lines to a new manufacturing facility. In the first quarter of 2004, continuing operations generated income of $4.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Overall, net income for the second quarter was $7.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes $0.06 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations, and a gain of $0.01 per diluted share from sale of the life safety systems and fab services operations that closed during the quarter. For the second quarter of 2003, net loss was $2.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, which included a loss of $0.09 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $6.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, including $0.04 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations and a gain of $0.03 per diluted share related to the sale of the gallium nitride business. For the six months ended June 30, revenue from continuing operations totaled $117.0 million, an increase of 51.9% compared with $77.0 million for the first half of 2003. Income from continuing operations was $9.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Overall net income for the first six months of 2004 was $14.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, which includes $0.09 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations, and a gain of $0.04 per diluted share from sale of three of the six discontinued operations. Gene Banucci, ATMI Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The semiconductor industry continues to increase production of wafers with a second quarter sequential increase of approximately 4% worldwide. This is again slightly higher than our projections and as a result ATMI's revenues continued to ramp aggressively for the third consecutive quarter. It is our expectation that wafer starts will continue to grow in the third quarter, but at a moderated pace." Doug Neugold, ATMI President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "This quarter, our copper businesses continued to perform well and we again achieved strong results in our implant materials and photoresist packaging products. At Semicon West, we introduced several new products and process efficiency solutions in which customers expressed a high level of interest, especially SDS3. Looking forward, we see no slowdown in the pace of technology development. Given our recent qualifications and joint development activities at the 65 nm technology node, we are well positioned to capture future generation advanced interconnect opportunities." -more-
ATMI Reports Second Quarter 2004 Results -- Page 2 Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "The second quarter stood out because of record sales of sub-atmospheric gas storage and delivery products, and equally strong flat panel display demand for our materials packaging products. Combined with the resolution of our first quarter expedited delivery issues, this had the expected effect of increasing gross margins to above 50%. On the divestiture front, the second quarter was very busy with deals completed for the sale of our life safety system business, our fab services business, and our epitaxial services business, which closed on July 19th. We are presently engaged in active discussions with multiple parties concerning our remaining discontinued operations, our abatement systems business and our Emosyn smart card venture. We believe we are still on track to have divested all 6 discontinued operations before the end of 2004."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release ATMI PARTNERS EMOSYN BUSINESS WITH SILICON STORAGE TECHNOLOGY DANBURY, CT -- September 13, 2004 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced that it has sold its Emosyn smart card business to Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSTI) through a newly formed subsidiary, Emosyn International. Emosyn International is to be jointly held by SST (83.6%) and ATMI (16.4%). Emosyn International, with approximately 40 employees, will operate as a separate entity, designing and developing leading edge integrated circuits (ICs) for the smart card market based on SST's SuperFlash technology. Emosyn will continue to have a research and development center in Silicon Valley, a marketing and application office in the United Kingdom, and an office in Singapore for marketing and applications support. Gene Banucci, Chief Executive Officer of ATMI, said, "We are very excited about our alliance with SST. In addition to the fact that they are a terrific company with outstanding flash memory technology, we believe this is the optimal pathway for ATMI both to focus on our materials-based strategy and to maintain the opportunity to generate shareholder value from our Emosyn investment." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "ATMI will realize an immediate gain on the sale of the Emosyn assets, while generating additional cash for our already strong balance sheet. As far as our Technologies divestment initiative is concerned, we are now at the point where five of the six Technologies
businesses in the ATMI portfolio have been divested. Thus we remain on track to complete this initiative by year-end."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- October 20, 2004 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $64.4 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 52% from $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2003, and an increase of 6% over $61.0 million in the second quarter of 2004. Continuing operations in the third quarter generated income of $6.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. In the third quarter of 2003, continuing operations generated a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, including $4.2 million in special charges related to asset impairments as a result of transitioning product lines to a new manufacturing facility, a write down in the Company's strategic investment portfolio, and a charge related to acquired in-process research and development. In the second quarter of 2004, continuing operations generated income of $5.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Overall, net income for the third quarter was $10.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, which includes earnings of $0.03 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations, and a gain of $0.11 per diluted share from sale of the epitaxial services and Emosyn discontinued operations. For the third quarter of 2003, net loss was $10.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, which included a loss of $0.20 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, including $0.06 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations and a gain of $0.01 per diluted share related to the sale of the life safety systems and fab services discontinued operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, revenue from continuing operations -more-
ATMI Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results -- Page 2 totaled $181.4 million, an increase of 52% compared with $119.3 million for the same period in 2003. Income from continuing operations was $16.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $3.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the same period last year, including $5.1 million in special charges related to asset impairments as a result of transitioning product lines to a new manufacturing facility, a write down in the Company's strategic investment portfolio, and a charge related to acquired in-process research and development. Overall net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $24.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which includes $0.12 per diluted share from the performance of discontinued operations, and a gain of $0.15 per diluted share from sale of five of the six discontinued operations. For the first nine months of 2003, net loss was $15.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, which included a loss of $0.38 from the performance of discontinued operations. Doug Neugold, ATMI President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "Our third quarter performance is an example of what we believe our wafer start-driven business model can achieve in a difficult environment. While we, like the rest of the industry, have some exposure to capital equipment push-outs and reductions in wafer starts, those declines for the most part represent trailing edge technologies. In ATMI's case, this is offset by the growth in emerging technology nodes -- 130 nanometer and below -- where we realize more than 30% of our business. Our customers are aggressively ramping these processes, a trend we expect to continue." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "ATMI's materials product lines showed continued growth during the third quarter. Gross margins sequentially improved to 50.6%, in an environment where volume manufacturing is ramping to meet additional copper-related materials demand beyond our customers' initial forecasts and our local inventories. Proceeds from sales of our discontinued epitaxial services and Emosyn
ATMI Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results -- Page 3 smart card businesses added over $50 million in cash to our balance sheet during the quarter. We continue to actively pursue the disposal of our abatement systems business, our only remaining discontinued operation, which we hope to complete by the end of 2004." Gene Banucci, ATMI Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "ATMI's third quarter is distinct directionally from those of many participants in the semiconductor supply chain. We expect pressures on the supply chain to continue in the fourth quarter as wafer start growth goes negative from essentially flat in the third quarter. Our best estimate at present is that wafer starts will shrink 7-10% during the fourth quarter and return to a growth mode in the first quarter of 2005. As far as ATMI is concerned, we anticipate that our copper wafer start-driven base of business will enable us to mitigate much of the impact of the global trend."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. This Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Registrant (the "Company") dated October 20, 2004, and accompanying press release, correcting an error in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2004, to reflect the "if-converted" method, which impacts the calculation of diluted earnings per share from operations of discontinued operations, diluted earnings per share from gain on disposal of discontinued operations and diluted earnings per share. The diluted earnings per share calculation pertaining to continuing operations of $0.20 was correct in the original filing and is not being amended. In the Company's press release dated October 20, 2004, the Company reported diluted weighted average shares outstanding as of September 30, 2004 of 31,603 (in thousands). In calculating the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations, diluted earnings per share from gain on disposal of discontinued operations and total diluted earnings per share, the Company's 5.25% convertible notes outstanding as of September 30, 2004 had a dilutive effect in the third quarter of 2004 for the first time requiring the application of the "if-converted" method to account for the underlying common shares. As corrected, diluted earnings per share from operations of discontinued operations, diluted earnings per share from gain on disposal of discontinued operations, and diluted earnings per share, are $0.02, $0.10, and $0.32, respectively, compared to the previously reported amounts of $0.03, $0.11, and $0.34, respectively. 2

Gene Banucci, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "With the sale of the treatment systems business, ATMI has successfully completed its plan to divest its discontinued operations during 2004. With the largest installed base of abatement treatment systems in the semiconductor industry, it was critically important for ATMI to support its customers by finding a buyer that was capable of providing world-class service capability. Further, we wanted to maximize the opportunity for the retention and growth of the ATMI employees who are staying with this business. We believe Applied Materials is the optimum buyer on both counts." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "This sale will complete the divestment of our six Technologies businesses. Now, ATMI's business model has been completely transformed into one of sustainable growth and profitability. We will book a small gain on the sale of this business and will have sold six businesses during 2004 for total cash proceeds of approximately $100 million. The divested operations include the Gallium Nitride venture to Cree; the Life Safety Systems unit to First Technology, a division of City Technology; Epitaxial Services to -- more -- 12
International Rectifier; Fab Services to Materials Support Resources; the Emosyn smartcard business to Silicon Storage Technology; and with this sale, the Abatement Equipment business to Applied Materials."

Exhibit 10.1 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT December 31, 2004 Daniel P. Sharkey 75 Hunters Ridge Road Southbury, CT 06488 Dear Dan: ATMI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), wishes to obtain and you wish to provide your services as an employee of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. As used herein, the "ATMI Group" means the Company, Advanced Technology Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ATMI Sub"), and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This Agreement is intended to supersede your Employment Agreement with Advanced Technologies Materials, Inc., dated October 10, 1997. Upon the execution of this Agreement and the Novation Agreement included below, your October 10, 1997 Employment Agreement with Advanced Technologies Materials, Inc. will be superceded and have no further effect. Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, effective the date of this Agreement, the Company and you intending to be legally bound agree as follows: 1. Position and Responsibilities. ----------------------------- 1.1 You shall serve as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company and ATMI Sub. You shall perform your duties at the Company's Danbury, Connecticut headquarters or at such other place as you and the Company shall mutually agree. You shall travel from time to time as reasonably required in connection with the performance of your duties. You shall report directly to the CEO of the Company and ATMI Sub. 1.2 Subject to Section 5, you will, to the best of your ability, devote your full business time and good faith efforts to the performance of your duties hereunder and to the business and affairs of the ATMI Group. You agree to serve as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub, subject to being re-elected to such office by their respective Boards of Directors, and to perform such executive duties consistent with your position as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
and Treasurer of the Company and ATMI Sub as may reasonably be assigned to you by their respective CEOs and Boards of Directors from time to time. 1.3 You will duly, punctually and faithfully perform and observe any and all reasonable rules and regulations that the ATMI Group may now or shall hereafter establish (if and once communicated to you) governing the conduct of the ATMI Group's business and generally applicable to similarly situated employees or officers of the ATMI Group. 2. Term of Employment ------------------ 2.1 The term of your employment shall be two (2) years (the "Initial Term") commencing on January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date"), and ending on the second anniversary thereof, provided your employment shall automatically terminate upon your death and may be terminated at any time as provided in and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2. At the end of the Initial Term, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to renew, extend, or modify the provisions hereof, your employment shall continue "at will," subject to the Company's obligations as hereinafter provided in this Section 2, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (as then in effect) shall continue. Section 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 will apply to termination of your employment after the Initial Term by the Company without Cause (other than pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or by you pursuant to Section 2.3. 2.2 The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you specifying the reason, to terminate your employment: (a) immediately for Cause (as defined in Section 2.4), subject to the cure rights set forth in Section 2.4 below, or (b) subject to Section 2.5 hereof, at any time without Cause, or (c) in the event of your total disability meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability ("LTD") program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify. 2.3 You shall have the right to terminate your employment for "Good Reason," which shall mean a resignation of your employment following: (a) any material reduction in your title, position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c)), including, without limitation, any failure by the Boards of Directors of the Company or ATMI Sub to re-elect you to your position as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; (b) any reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below; (c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles without your consent, (d) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or (e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of 2
the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option or restricted stock agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested) provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within one hundred eighty (180) days after such breach, and an opportunity to cure such breach (if curable), shall be afforded the Company and "Good Reason" shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such prior notice. 2.4 The term "Cause" shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board of Directors of ATMI or ATMI Sub or their CEOs pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting "Cause" hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as "willful misconduct" if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group. 2.5 Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3: (i) the Company shall pay to you an aggregate of twelve (12) months' Base Salary at the time of termination and (ii) if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall pay the premiums associated with such benefits on the same basis the Company would have paid such premiums during such period had you continued to be an employee of the Company. The amount described in clause (i) above shall be payable in installments on such date or dates on which Base Salary would have been paid to you had your employment not been terminated. 2.6 Subject to Section 2.7, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 within 548 days after a "change in control" of the Company (a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and all restricted stock issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock; and (b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned. To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your 3
restricted stock, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted, such shares shall not vest. In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your termination of employment an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted. Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax on "excess parachute payments" under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will reimburse you for any such excise tax imposed on a "fully grossed up basis," such that you will receive the same net amount (after payment of all income, employment and excise taxes imposed with respect to such benefits and such tax reimbursements, and of any interest or penalties relating to any such excise taxes or to the income tax due on any such tax reimbursements (other than interest or penalties arising as a result of your failure to timely pay such excise or income taxes with respect to which you had previously received reimbursement)) as you would have received if such excise tax had not been imposed in the first place. For purposes of this Section 2.6, a "change in control" of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if: (i) a third person, including a "person" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving: individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved. 2.7 As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you must timely execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other executive officer of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you to waive any payments or benefits 4
due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement. 2.8 Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating. 2.9 You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group. 3. Compensation ------------ 3.1 The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at the annual rate of $280,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your "Base Salary"). 3.2 You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. For calendar years 2005 and 2006, you will have an incentive compensation award opportunity with a target of 50% of Base Salary and a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of Base Salary. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation 5
award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof. 4. Other Benefits -------------- 4.1 You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy. 4.2 You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated officers or employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time. 4.3 You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options and/or restricted stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion. 4.4 You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company and/or ATMI Sub. 4.5 All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings. 5. Other Activities During Employment ---------------------------------- 5.1 Except with the prior written consent of the Company's Board of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 5.2 Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group. 6
5.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles. 6. Former Employment 6.1 You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party. 6.2 You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company. 7. Confidentiality. 7.1 You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as "Confidential Information" and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you. 7.2 Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties. 7.3 You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group. 7.4 The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by 7
the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement. 8. Post-Employment Activities. -------------------------- 8.1 You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, absent the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly: (a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development; (b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees; (c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Group's other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or (d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group. 8.2 Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the 8
foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s). 9. Remedies. Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative. 10. Miscellaneous. ------------- 10.1 This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof. 10.2 In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties expressly agree that a court may rewrite and modify such provisions so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear. 10.3 All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested; or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties): 9

If either party shall waive any breach of any provision of this Agreement, such party shall not thereby be deemed to have waived any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 10.5 The headings of the sections hereof are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof nor to affect the meaning hereof. 10.6 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed (both as to validity and performance) and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction. Each party hereby agrees to accept the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Connecticut, and those of the United States of America situated in the State of Connecticut, for the adjudication of any dispute arising out of this Agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably (1) agrees that any suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement may be brought in any Connecticut or United States federal court located in Connecticut; (2) consents to the jurisdiction of each such court in any such suit, action, or legal proceeding; (3) waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action, or legal proceeding in any of such courts; and (4) agrees that Connecticut is the most convenient forum for litigation of any such suit, action or legal proceeding. 10.7 This Agreement and the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement, represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and may not be amended, supplemented, cancelled or discharged except by written instrument executed by both parties hereto. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior agreements between the Company and you with respect to the matters covered hereby. 10.8 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall constitute a complete and original instrument but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and it shall not be necessary when making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart thereof to account for any other counterpart. 10
10.9 You acknowledge that you had the opportunity to have this Agreement reviewed by an attorney prior to your execution of this Agreement. 10.10 You will be entitled to full indemnification with respect to any and all claims and liabilities (and all related legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by you or on your behalf) asserted against you in your capacity as an officer or director of the Company or ATMI Sub or any member of the ATMI Group to the maximum extent provided in their charter documents as amended from time to time, copies of which (as to the Company and ATMI Sub) have been provided to you, and in accordance with Delaware law. You will be entitled to coverage as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub pursuant to director and officer liability insurance coverage obtained by members of the ATMI Group on the same basis as such coverage is made available to similarly situated officers of ATMI Group companies. If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing and returning the enclosed copy of this letter. ATMI, INC.

Exhibit 10.2 AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT December 31, 2004 Cynthia L.

T For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2004 RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- February 2, 2005 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter, and for the year 2004. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 Revenues from continuing operations were $64.9 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 24% from the fourth quarter of last year, and up 1% sequentially from the third quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations was $3.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, which includes a $0.09 per share special charge related to the write-down of a strategic equity investment. Excluding this special charge, income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $0.22 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations was $5.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of last year, which included both a $0.03 per diluted share special charge related to a write-down of a strategic equity investment and a $0.10 per diluted share one-time tax benefit. Income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2004 was $6.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. Overall, net income for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, which includes a $0.01 per diluted share loss from discontinued operations and a gain of $0.10 per diluted share on the sale of the one remaining discontinued operation. For the fourth quarter last year, net income was $5.2 -- more --
ATMI Reports Fourth Quarter and 2004 Results -- Page 2 of 6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, including a $0.01 loss per diluted share from discontinued operations. RESULTS FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 2004 For 2004, revenues from continuing operations were $246.3 million, up 43% from $171.6 million in 2003. Income from continuing operations was $20.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, including a $0.09 per diluted share charge for a strategic equity investment write-down. In 2003, income from continuing operations was $2.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, including a $0.12 per diluted share net charge for special items consisting of a one-time tax benefit offset by a strategic equity investment write-down and other special charges. Overall, net income was $31.5 million, or $1.00 per diluted share in 2004, including $0.26 per diluted share in gains from sales of discontinued operations, and $0.10 per diluted share of income from the actual operations of discontinued businesses during the year. That compares with a loss of $9.9 million in 2003, or $0.32 per diluted share, including a $0.38 loss per diluted share from the operations of discontinued businesses during the year. COMMENTS Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "2004 was an important year for the Company. With the completion of our divestiture activity, we ended 2004 and start 2005 focused on our three key offerings: SDS(R) for implant gas delivery, performance materials used in high growth, advanced copper interconnect processes, and packaging products for photoresist and other performance materials
ATMI Reports Fourth Quarter and 2004 Results -- Page 3 of 6 where process efficiency is demanded. This mix gives us stability, even when overall wafer starts slow, or temporarily contract." "For 2005, we have set aggressive targets for increasing our focus on key customers, expanding our presence in Asia, improving our position at the leading edge with new products and services for advanced devices, and growing market share for existing devices. ATMI's model of providing products that enable leading edge processes offers ATMI significant growth opportunities. Our wafer start-driven model and our market strength in emerging technology nodes enhance our ability to generate profit and positive cash flow despite the frequently cyclical market environment." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer, said, "The strength from our product lines that sell into advanced technology applications drove sequential growth in a quarter where global wafer starts were down by almost 10%. A favorable product mix, driven primarily by a strong quarter for our liquid packaging products, drove sequentially better gross margins, at 51.5% for the quarter, and operating profitability at $0.22 per share. We begin 2005 with an extremely strong balance sheet, supported by almost $240 million in cash, as our completed divestitures in 2004, all at above book value, generated almost $100 million. For the first quarter of 2005, with the expectations that copper lines are still running at high capacity, and that worldwide wafer starts will be relatively flat, we anticipate revenues in the range of $63 million to $67 million, with earnings between $0.17 and $0.23 per share."

Item 2.04 Triggering Events That Accelerate Or Increase A Direct Financial Obligation Or An Obligation Under An Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement. On March 9, 2005, ATMI, Inc. caused notice to be delivered by mail to the registered holders of its 5.25% convertible subordinated notes due November 15, 2006 to inform such holders that ATMI has elected to redeem the notes in their entirety. As of that date, the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes was $115,000,000. The notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 13, 2001 between ATMI and U.S. Bank, as successor trustee. Pursuant to the notice and the terms of the Indenture, the notes will be redeemed on April 8, 2005 at a price of 102.1% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to April 8, 2005, unless earlier converted. No interest on the notes will accrue after April 8, 2005. Note holders who choose to convert their notes into shares of common stock will have until 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 7, 2005 to make their election by informing the corporate trust department of U.S. Bank pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The conversion rate is 45.0704 shares of common stock per $1000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to approximately $22.19 per share. Were all note holders to elect to convert their notes into shares of common stock, ATMI would need to issue 5.183 million additional shares of common stock, creating diluted shares outstanding of approximately 36.8 million. ATMI will not be obligated to pay the redemption price with respect to any notes that are converted into shares of common stock prior to the redemption date. 2

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- April 20, 2005 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $66.1 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 18% from $56.0 million in the first quarter of 2004, and a 2% increase from $64.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Doug Neugold, ATMI President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "ATMI's strategy of working with the world's leading integrated circuit producers to provide key materials for their most advanced chips holds excellent prospects for long term sustainable growth. While it's clear that certain sectors in our industry are feeling pressure, our product portfolio leaves our growth expectations for 2005 unchanged." Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was $6.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. For the first quarter of 2004, on a comparable basis, income from continuing operations was $4.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, and net income was $0.19 per diluted share as reported, which included $0.07 per diluted share related to discontinued operations and the gain on the sale of the one discontinued operation divested during that first quarter of 2004. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004, on a comparable basis and reported as income from continuing operations, was $3.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share - which included the impact of a $0.09 per share special charge related to the write-down of a strategic equity investment. Net income as reported in total was $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of -more-
ATMI Reports First Quarter Financial Results -- Page 2 of 5 2004, which included $0.09 per share related to discontinued operations and the sale of the last of our discontinued operations during that quarter. "We have deepened several strategic key account relationships through our broad product portfolio, development activity in emerging materials, and value-added applications support for all these products," said Neugold. "Overall, worldwide wafer starts for the first quarter were somewhat softer than expected, yet we continue to believe growth for the year will be in the 5% to 7% range. Copper wafer starts remain strong, and we believe on course to increase by 30% this year." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "In an environment where global wafer starts were slightly down from the previous quarter, our revenues grew due to our product strength in leading edge processes. Gross margins improved slightly quarter-on-quarter to 51.7% for the first quarter versus 51.5% for the fourth quarter of last year, and up from 48.6% in the first quarter of 2004. SG&A included incremental spending for litigation as a result of increased activity in our patent lawsuit, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For the second quarter, we anticipate revenues between $65 and $69 million, with earnings per share between $0.18 and $0.23, based on our belief that worldwide wafer starts should increase slightly and that copper wafer start growth will continue at current levels. During the first quarter, ATMI announced it would call its $115 million convertible subordinated notes due in 2006. The debt was retired just after the end of the quarter, and all debt holders elected to convert into ATMI common shares.
ATMI Reports First Quarter Financial Results -- Page 3 of 5 ATMI issued 5,183,095 shares to the note holders on April 8. With the elimination of the interest expense associated with this retired debt, the dilutive effect of the additional shares is nominal at current earnings levels."

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- July 20, 2005 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $69.3 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 14% from $61 million in the second quarter of 2004, and a 5% increase from $66.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 grew 37% to $8.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $5.8 million from continuing operations, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2004. Reported net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, which included $2.1 million or $0.07 of earnings from our discontinued operations, all of which were sold during 2004. The 2005 three- and six-month earnings per share calculations include the weighted-average effect of the conversion of $115 million of convertible debt into an incremental 5.183 million common shares in April 2005. Doug Neugold, ATMI President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The strengthening in wafer starts that began at the end of the last quarter continued through this quarter, and appears to be broad based. Our interactions with customers at Semicon West regarding existing technologies reinforce our optimism about the SDS and packaging product lines. We expect advanced technology ramps to continue in the second half, which should further strengthen ATMI's revenue growth. Our main focus at this point is ensuring that we achieve our manufacturing ramps in support of our key customers." For the six months ended June 30, 2005, revenues were $135.4 million, an increase of 16% compared with revenues of $117.0 million for the first half of 2004. Net income was $14.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with $9.8 million from continuing operations, or $0.31 per diluted share, last year. Reported net income for the first six months of 2004 was $14.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, which includes $0.13 per diluted share of earnings from discontinued operations in 2004. -- more --
ATMI Reports Second Quarter Financial Results -- Page 2 Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer said, "Our wafer start-driven business delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth, and generated approximately $14 million of cash from operations. Gross margins at 50.3% were flat when compared with 50.3% for the second quarter of 2004, but down from the 51.7% generated in the first quarter of this year. The sequential margin decline resulted from operating parallel facilities in preparation for the move of our packaging manufacturing operations, along with a slight impact from product mix." "With wafer start momentum picking up, we expect revenues in the second half to grow nicely. For the third quarter, we anticipate revenues between $70 million and $74 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.21 and $0.25. This is based on our belief that worldwide wafer starts should show additional strength and that copper wafer starts will maintain their current outsized growth rate."

Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series, by resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the shares thereof, to determine and fix such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be stated and expressed in such resolutions, all to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolutions providing for issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series to the extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided in this certificate of incorporation, no vote of the holders of the Preferred 2
Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the designation or issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock authorized by and complying with the conditions of this certificate of incorporation, the right to have such vote being expressly waived by all present and future holders of the capital stock of the corporation. Within the limits and restrictions stated in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors is authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series. SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK Pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors on October 13, 2000, adopted the following resolution creating a series of 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock: RESOLVED, that, pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as follows: SECTION 1. Designation and Amount. The designation of the series of Preferred Stock created by this resolution shall be `Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock' and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 500,000. SECTION 2. Dividends and Distributions. (A) Out of the surplus or net profits of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as such dividends may be declared by the Board of Directors, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the tenth days of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after November 9, 2000 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine 3
the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have been entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares shall be prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date on which shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are first issued, or unless the date of issue shall be a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or shall be a date after the record date for the next Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments which may be in arrears. (C) Dividends payable upon the share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be cumulative (whether or not in any dividend period or periods there shall be surplus or net profits of the Corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends) so that, if on any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date dividends upon the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not have been paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment, the amount of the deficiency shall be fully paid, but without interest, or dividends in such amount declared on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment, before any dividend shall be declared or paid upon or set apart for, or any other distribution shall be made in respect of, or any payment shall be made in respect of, or any payment shall be made on account of the purchase of, the Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock subordinate to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. SECTION 3. Distributions to Holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock. Out of any surplus or net profits of the Corporation legally available for dividends remaining after full cumulative dividends upon any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have been paid for all past dividend periods, and after or concurrently with making payment of, or declaring and setting apart for payment, full dividends on any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding to the most recent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and after the Corporation shall have complied with the provisions in respect of any and all amounts then or theretofore required to be set aside in respect of any sinking fund or purchase fund with respect to any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund or purchase fund, and after the Corporation shall have made provision for compliance in respect of the current sinking fund or purchase period for any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then and not otherwise the holders of Series A Junior 4
Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to or may receive dividends and redemption payments as provided herein. Out of any surplus or net profits of the Corporation legally available for dividends remaining after full cumulative dividends upon the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid through the preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, and after the Corporation shall have complied with the provisions in respect of any and all amounts then or theretofore required (if any) to be set aside or applied in respect of any redemption payments in respect of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then and not otherwise, the holders of Common Stock and of any series of Preferred Stock ranking subordinate to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall, subject to the rights of any other series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, to paragraph (A) of Section 2 hereof and to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, be entitled to receive such dividends as may from time to time be declared by the Board of Directors. SECTION 4. Voting. (A) Holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to 100 votes for each share of stock held. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number of votes by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Except as provided in this Section 4 and except as may be required by applicable law, holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall vote with the Common Stock on all matters required to be submitted to holders of Common Stock and shall not be entitled to vote as a separate class with respect to any matter. (B) So long as any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at the time outstanding (or such greater percentage as may be required under applicable law), acting as a single class, alter or change the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock by the Certificate of Incorporation so as to affect such powers, preferences or rights adversely. (C) If at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors a default in preference dividends, as the term "default in preference dividends" is hereinafter defined with respect to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, shall exist, the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class with the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock so entitled to vote, shall have the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors; and the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote in the election of the directors of the Corporation to be elected as provided in the foregoing clause. Whenever a default in preference dividends shall commence to exist, the Corporation, upon the written request of the holders of 5% or more of the 5
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so entitled to vote, shall call a special meeting of the holders of the Preferred Stock so entitled to vote, such special meeting to be held within 120 days after the date on which such request shall be received by the Corporation, for the purpose of enabling such holders to elect members of the Board of Directors as provided in the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that such special meeting need not be called if an annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors shall be scheduled to be held within such 120 days; and provided further that in lieu of any such special meeting, the election of the directors to be elected thereat may be effected by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares that would be entitled to be voted upon at such special meeting. Prior to any such special meeting or meetings, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased to the extent necessary to provide as additional places on the Board of Directors the directorships to be filled by the directors to be elected thereat. Any director elected as aforesaid by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or of any series thereof shall cease to serve as such director whenever a default in preference dividends shall cease to exist. If, prior to the end of the term of any director elected as aforesaid by the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock or of any series thereof, or elected by the holders of Common Stock, a vacancy in the office of such director shall occur by reason of death, resignation, removal or disability, or for any other cause, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the manner provided in the Bylaws; provided, however, that if such vacancy shall be filled by election by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the right to fill such vacancy shall be vested in the holders of that class of stock or series thereof which elected the director the vacancy in the office of whom is so to be filled, unless, in any such case, no default in preference dividends shall exist at the time of such election. For the purposes of this paragraph (C), a "default in preference dividends" with respect to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of dividends in arrears upon the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six full quarterly dividends or more, and, having so occurred, such default in preference dividends shall be deemed to exist thereafter until, but only until, all dividends in arrears on all shares of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid. The term "dividends in arrears" whenever used in this paragraph (C) with reference to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be deemed to mean (whether or not in any dividend period in respect of which such term is used there shall have been surplus or net profits of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends) that amount which shall be equal to cumulative dividends at the rate for the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for all past quarterly dividend periods less the amount of all dividends paid, or deemed paid, for all such periods upon such Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent an increase in the number of directors of the Corporation pursuant to its Bylaws as from time to time in effect so as to provide as additional places on the Board of Directors directorships to be filled by the directors so to be elected by the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or to prevent any other change in the number of the directors of the Corporation. (D) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise required by law, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. 6
SECTION 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors. SECTION 6. Liquidation Rights. (A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary of otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation ("Liquidation"), the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the shares of any series of Preferred Stock subordinate to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as to assets in the event of any Liquidation ("Junior Shares") or on the Common Stock, the amount of $100.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon through the date of final distribution (the "Series A Liquidation Preference"). (B) The shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be subordinate to any other series of Preferred Stock unless the provisions of such other series provide otherwise, and shall be preferred over the Common Stock, as to assets in the event of any Liquidation. In the event of any Liquidation, the holders of the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders (after payment in full of all amounts payable in respect of any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock), an amount determined as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section 6 for every share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock before any distribution of assets shall be made to the holders of any Junior Shares or to the holders of the Common Stock. If, in the event of any Liquidation, the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received all the amounts to which they shall be entitled in accordance with the terms of paragraph (A) of this Section 6, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in paragraph (C) of this Section 6 to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii) being referred to herein as the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Common Stock, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed to the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively. If, upon any Liquidation, the amounts payable on or with respect to Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of shares of such Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of assets according to the respective 7
amounts which would be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such Preferred Stock were paid in full. (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (D) Neither the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Corporation nor the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or other entity or the merger or consolidation of any other corporation or other entity into or with the Corporation shall be deemed to be a Liquidation for the purposes of this Section 6. SECTION 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock shall be exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. SECTION 8. Optional Redemption. (A) The Corporation shall have the option to redeem the whole or any part of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at any time at a redemption price equal to, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the "current per share market price" of the Common Stock on the date of the mailing of the notice of redemption, together with unpaid accumulated dividends to the date of such redemption. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares by 8
reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be otherwise entitled immediately prior to such event under the immediately preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. The "current per share market price" on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices per share of such Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days (as such term in hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date. The closing price for each Trading Day shall be the last sale price, regular way, on such day or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, on such day in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on the NYSE, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal United States national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any United States national securities exchange, the last quoted sale price on such day or, if not so quoted the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market on such day, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System ("Nasdaq") or such other system then in use or, if on any such day the Common Stock is not quoted by any such system, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common Stock selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (which selection shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes) or, if on such day no such market maker is be making a market in the Common Stock, the fair market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (which determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes). The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal United States national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is be listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any United States national securities exchange, but are traded in the over-the-counter market and reported by Nasdaq, then any day for which Nasdaq reports the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, or if the Common Stock is not traded in the over-the counter market and reported by Nasdaq, then any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. (B) Notice of any such redemption shall be given by mailing to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock a notice of such redemption, first class postage prepaid, not later than the thirtieth day and not earlier than the sixtieth day before the date fixed for redemption, at their last address as the same shall appear upon the books of Corporation. Any notice which shall be mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the stockholder shall have received such notice, and failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to any holder of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. 9
(C) If less than all the outstanding shares of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are to be redeemed by the Corporation, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be determined by lot or pro rata or in such fair and equitable other manner as may be prescribed by resolution of the Board of Directors. (D) The notice of redemption to each holder of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall specify (a) the number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of such holder to be redeemed, (b) the date fixed for redemption, (c) the redemption price and (d) the place of payment of the redemption price. (E) If any such notice of redemption shall have been duly given or if the Corporation shall have given to the bank or trust company hereinafter referred to irrevocable written authorization promptly to give or complete such notice, and if on or before the redemption date specified therein the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been deposited by the Corporation with the bank or trust company designated in such notice, doing business in the United States of America and having a capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $100,000,000 according to its last published statement of condition, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for such shares so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after the time of such deposit all such shares called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding, all rights with respect to such shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith cease and terminate, except the right of the holders thereof to receive from such bank or trust company at any time after the time of such deposit the funds so deposited, without interest. In case less than all the shares represented by any surrendered certificate shall be redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. Any interest accrued on such funds so deposited shall be paid to the Corporation from time to time. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of six years from such redemption date shall be repaid to the Corporation, after which the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment thereof; provided, however, that any funds so deposited which shall not be required for redemption because of the exercise of any privilege of conversion or exchange subsequent to the date of deposit shall be repaid to the Corporation forthwith. SECTION 9. Ranking. The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise. SECTION 10. Fractional Shares. Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. 10

No one class shall have more than one director more than any other class. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting in lieu thereof following the annual meeting at which such director was elected and until such director's successor is duly elected and qualified; provided, however, that each initial director in Class I shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting or any special meeting in lieu thereof next following the end of the corporation's 1997 fiscal year; each initial director in Class II shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting or any special meeting in lieu thereof next following the end of the corporation's 1998 fiscal year; and each initial director in Class III shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting or any special meeting in lieu thereof next following the end of the corporation's 1999 fiscal year.

To the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the foregoing, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum.

Meetings of stockholders for any other purpose may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. B. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting of the stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication; provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the
meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation. 2.2 Annual Meeting. Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held on such date no more than 13 months following the date of the preceding annual meeting (which date shall not be a legal holiday in the place where the meeting is to be held) and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which (subject to the quorum requirements set forth in Section 2.6), except as otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the stockholders shall elect, by a plurality vote of the shares represented in person or by proxy, directors to succeed those whose terms are expiring, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. 2.3 Notice of Meetings. A. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholder in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article IV hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). B. If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. C. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2
D. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. 2.4 Voting List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. In accordance with Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, nothing contained in this Section 2.4 shall be construed to require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network; provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (b) at the principal executive office of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of the shares held by each of them. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 2.5 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President) and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the request in writing of (a) a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office or (b) the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President). Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. 2.6 Quorum; Adjournments. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the shares represented thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of 3
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.7 Voting and Proxies. A. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting shall decide any matter brought before such meeting (subject to Section 2.5 in the case of any special meeting of stockholders), unless the matter is one upon which by an express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. B. Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum. C. Every person entitled to vote at a meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at any meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by written proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. D. Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. 2.8 No Stockholder Action By Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and no action by the stockholders may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 2.9 Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations. A. Annual Meetings of Stockholders. (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) if specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 4
2.9, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.9. (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Section 2.9(A)(1)(c), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such an anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and held of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.9(A)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, at least seventy (70) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. 5
B. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 2.9(A)(2) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting, or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. C. General. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be eligible to serve as directors, and only such business as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by law or these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance herewith to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. (2) For purposes of this Section 2.9, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances. 6
ARTICLE III Directors 3.1 Number; Election and Qualification. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3) nor more than fifteen (15). Thereafter, within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be increased or decreased upon the approval of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.6, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. 3.2 Classes of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible. No one class shall have more than one director more than any other class. 3.3 Terms in Office. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third succeeding annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. 3.4 Allocation of Directors Among Classes in the Event of Increases or Decreases in the Number of Directors. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of such director's current term or such director's prior death, retirement, removal or resignation and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors, subject to Section 3.2 and the following sentence. To the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the foregoing, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the full Board of Directors shall shorten the term of an incumbent director. 3.5 Tenure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. 3.6 Filling of Vacancies. Except as otherwise prescribed by law, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, or as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office, and a director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders at which directors of the class to which such position belongs are to be elected and until his or her successor is elected and 7
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by law. 3.7 Powers of the Board. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled. 3.8 Resignation. Any director may resign by delivering his or her written resignation to the corporation at its principal office or to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. 3.9 Meetings. A. The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware. B. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. C. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary on five (5) days' notice to each director, either personally, by mail, by telegram, by facsimile, or by electronic mail; special meetings shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two or more directors (or one director if the Board of Directors consists of only one or two directors). Notice of any meeting may be deemed waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat. A notice or waiver of notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not specify the purposes of the meeting. 3.10 Quorum; Voting. At all meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, a majority of the directors of the full Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, except as a different vote may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or committee, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. 3.11 Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the 8
writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. 3.12 Meetings by Telephone Conference Call. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.13 Committees. A. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the full Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. B. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. C. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to provisions of law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided that no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending these bylaws and, unless the resolution or the Certificate of Incorporation expressly so provides, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock. D. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. 3.14 Compensation of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors and to make grants and awards to directors under any stock option, restricted stock, or any other benefit plan in which directors may participate from time to time. Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, directors may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated fee as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation in connection with committee service. 9
ARTICLE IV Notices 4.1 Notice to Stockholders. Whenever, under any provision of law or these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 4.2 Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in Section 4.1. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. The Secretary of the corporation shall make reasonable efforts to maintain updated contact information for each director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. 4.3 No Known Address. If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the principal executive office of the corporation. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and the time at which such notice was directed to each such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained. 4.4 Timing. All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to 10
receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to directors by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the corporation. 4.5 Effect of Failure to Receive Notice. The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice. 4.6 Waiver. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. 4.7 Notice to the Corporation.

The Treasurer shall disburse the funds of the corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements, and shall render to the President and the Board of Directors, at its regular meetings, or when the Board of Directors so requires, an account of all transactions as treasurer and of the financial condition of the corporation. 5.11 Assistant Treasurer. The Assistant Treasurer, or if there shall be more than one, the Assistant Treasurers in the order determined by the Board of Directors (or if there be no such determination, then in the order of their election), shall, in the absence of the Treasurer or in the event of the Treasurer's inability or refusal to act, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Treasurer and shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. ARTICLE VI Certificates of Stock 6.1 Certificate. Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the Chairman of the Board (if there be such an officer appointed) or vice chairman of the Board of Directors, or by the President or any Vice President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the corporation. 6.2 Stock Legends. Every certificate for shares of stock which are subject to any restriction on transfer pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws or any agreement to which the corporation is a party, shall have conspicuously noted on the face or back of the certificate either the full text of the restriction or a statement of the existence of such restriction and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the holder of such certificate upon written request and without charge. Every certificate issued when the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock shall set forth on its face or back either the full text of the preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special and relative rights of the shares of each class and series authorized to be issued or a statement of the existence of such preferences, powers, qualifications and rights and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the holder of such certificate upon written request and without charge. 13
6.3 Signatures on Certificates. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 6.4 Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner's legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 6.5 Transfer of Stock. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. 6.6 Fixing Record Date. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action shall be at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the date on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 6.7 Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. 14
ARTICLE VII General Provisions 7.1 Dividends. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of capital stock, subject to the provisions of applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation. 7.2 Reserves to Meet Contingencies. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside, out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall deem conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created. 7.3 Checks. All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate. 7.4 Fiscal Year.

The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. ARTICLE VIII Indemnification 8.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Article VIII: (1) "authorized representative" shall mean any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, any person serving at the request of the corporation (as defined below) and any person designated as an authorized representative by the board of directors or any officer of the corporation to whom the board of directors has delegated the authority to make such designations; (2) "corporate proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, proceeding under an alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor; (3) "criminal third party proceeding" shall include any action or investigation which could or does lead to a criminal third party proceeding; 15
(4) "expenses" shall include attorneys' fees and disbursements; (5) "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (6) actions "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" shall include without limitation actions taken in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan; (7) "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; (8) "party" shall include the giving of testimony or similar involvement; (9) "serving at the request of the corporation" shall mean any person serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and (10) "third party proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal or administrative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation. 8.2 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Third Party Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any third party proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing, such third party proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any third party proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the authorized representative did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. 16
8.3 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Corporate Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any corporate proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal) such corporate proceeding, or preparing for any of the foregoing, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation except and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such corporate proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 8.4 Mandatory Indemnification of Authorized Representatives. To the extent that an authorized representative entitled to indemnification pursuant to 8.2 or 8.3 above has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any third party proceeding or corporate proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 8.5 Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article VIII, Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the board or directors that indemnification is proper in the circumstances. Such determination shall be made: A. by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding; or B. by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; or C. if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or D. by the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of the corporation's stockholders holding at least 50% of the then issued and outstanding shares of voting capital stock of the corporation. 17
8.6 Advancing Expenses. Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending a third party proceeding or corporate proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding and within thirty (30) days of receipt by the secretary of the corporation, if required by law, an undertaking by or on behalf of the authorized representative to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the authorized representative is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VIII or otherwise. Such expenses shall be so paid upon such other reasonable terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. The financial ability of any authorized representative to make a repayment contemplated by this section shall not be a prerequisite to the making of an advance. 8.7 Insurance. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an authorized representative against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. 8.8 Scope of Article VIII. The indemnification of authorized representatives and advancement of expenses, as authorized by the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an authorized representative and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 8.9 Reliance on Provisions. Each person who shall act as an authorized representative of the corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon rights of indemnification provided by this Article VIII. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the corporation or otherwise shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of an authorized representative existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 8.10 Severability. If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 8.11 Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the authorized 18
representative, who, at the request of the corporation and at its sole cost and expense, shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 8.12 Intent of Article. The intent of this Article VIII is to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. To the extent that such Section or any successor section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article VIII shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law. ARTICLE IX Amendments 9.1 By the Board of Directors. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws of the corporation. 9.2 By the Stockholders. Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, these bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least seventy percent (70%) of the shares of capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any regular meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders, acting as a single class, subject to any additional vote required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws, provided notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws shall have been stated in the notice of such meeting. ARTICLE X Voting of Securities Owned by the Corporation All stock and other securities of other corporations or entities owned or held by the corporation for itself, or for other parties in any capacity, shall be voted, and all proxies with respect thereto shall be executed, by the person authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such authorization, by the Chairman of the Board (if there be such an officer appointed), or by the President, or, subject to Section 5.7, by any Vice President. 19
ARTICLE XI Other Securities of the Corporation All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates, may be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon, shall have ceased to be such officer of the corporation before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation. 20

Exhibit 10.1 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT September 19, 2005 Eugene G. Banucci, Ph.D. 20 Shore Rd. Danbury, CT 06810 Dear Gene: ATMI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), wishes to obtain and you wish to provide your services as an employee of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. As used herein, the "ATMI Group" means the Company, Advanced Technology Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ATMI Sub"), and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This Agreement is intended to supersede your Employment Agreement with Advanced Technologies Materials, Inc., dated October 10, 1997 and any amendments thereto (the "Prior Agreement"). Upon the execution of this Agreement and the Novation Agreement included below, the Prior Agreement will be superseded and have no further effect. Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, the Company and you intending to be legally bound agree as follows: 1. Position and Responsibilities ----------------------------- 1.1 You shall serve as executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company or such other position(s) with consultative or strategic guidance responsibilities as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may designate. You shall perform your duties at the Company's Danbury, Connecticut headquarters or at such other place as you and the Company shall mutually agree. You shall travel from time to time as reasonably required in connection with the performance of your duties. You shall report directly to the Board and as requested by the Board work at the direction of the CEO of the Company. 1.2 Subject to Section 5, you will, to the best of your ability, devote your full business time and good faith efforts to the performance of your duties hereunder and to the business and affairs of the ATMI Group. You agree to perform such senior executive duties consistent with
your position as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board or the Board of Directors of ATMI Sub from time to time. 1.3 You will duly, punctually and faithfully perform and observe any and all reasonable rules and regulations that the ATMI Group may now or shall hereafter establish (if and once communicated to you) governing the conduct of the ATMI Group's business and generally applicable to similarly situated employees or officers of the ATMI Group. 2. Term of Employment ------------------ 2.1 The term of your employment shall commence on January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date"), and end on June 5, 2008 (the "Term"), provided that your employment shall automatically terminate upon your death and may be terminated at any time as provided in and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2. 2.2 The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you specifying the reason, to terminate your employment: (a) immediately for Cause (as defined in Section 2.4), subject to the cure rights set forth in Section 2.4 below, or (b) subject to Section 2.5 hereof, at any time without Cause, or (c) in the event of your total disability meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability ("LTD") program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify. 2.3 You shall have the right to terminate your employment for "Good Reason," which shall mean a resignation of your employment following: (a) any reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below; (b) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; (c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles without your consent; or (d) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option or restricted stock agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested) provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within one hundred eighty (180) days after such breach, and an opportunity to cure such breach (if curable), shall be afforded the Company and "Good Reason" shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such prior notice. 2.4 The term "Cause" shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI 2
Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board or the Board of Directors of ATMI Sub pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting "Cause" hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as "willful misconduct" if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group. 2.5 Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment due to your death, due to your total disability (pursuant to Section 2.2(c)), by the Company without Cause (pursuant to Section 2.2(b)), or by you for Good Reason (pursuant to Section 2.3): the Company shall pay to you or your estate (as the case may be) (i) your Base Salary at the time of termination for the remainder of the Term and (ii) if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall pay the premiums associated with such benefits on the same basis the Company would have paid such premiums during such period had you continued to be an active employee of the Company until the earlier of (a) such time as you are ineligible for COBRA coverage; or (b) June 5, 2008. The amounts described in clause (i) above shall be payable in a lump sum within 60 days of the termination of your employment. 2.6 Subject to Section 2.7, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 within 548 days after a "change in control" of the Company, (a) (i) unless the Board determines otherwise pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 10 of the ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") (relating to the Board's discretion to cash out or require the exercise of all vested and unvested options in connection with the change in control) or a comparable provision of any other plan, which in no event may cause the forfeiture of unvested options, all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and (ii) all restricted stock issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock; and (b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned. The amounts described in clause (b) above shall be payable within two and one half months after the end of the year in which your employment with the Company terminates. To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the 2003 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted, such shares shall not vest. In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your 3
termination of employment an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted. Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax on "excess parachute payments" under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will reimburse you for any such excise tax imposed on a "fully grossed up basis," such that you will receive the same net amount (after payment of all income, employment and excise taxes imposed with respect to such benefits and such tax reimbursements, and of any interest or penalties relating to any such excise taxes or to the income tax due on any such tax reimbursements (other than interest or penalties arising as a result of your failure to timely pay such excise or income taxes with respect to which you had previously received reimbursement)) as you would have received if such excise tax had not been imposed in the first place. Any such reimbursement by the Company shall be payable as soon as practicable after liability for the excise tax is determined but in no event later than two and one half months after the end of the year in which your employment with the Company terminates. For purposes of this Section 2.6, a "change in control" of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if: (i) a third person, including a "person" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving: individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved. 2.7 As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you (or, in the event of your death, your representative) must timely execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other executive officer of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you 4
to waive any payments or benefits due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement. 2.8 Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case of termination due to your death or pursuant to Section 2.2(b), 2.2(c), or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you (or your representative) shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating. 2.9 You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group. 3. Compensation ------------ 3.1 The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at an annual rate of $450,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your "Base Salary"). 3.2 You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. For calendar year 2005, you will have an incentive compensation ("IC") award opportunity with a target of 70% of Base Salary (threshold of 35%; stretch of 140%). For calendar year 2006, you will have an IC award opportunity with a target of 50% of Base Salary (threshold of 25%; stretch of 100%). For calendar year 2007, you will have 5
an IC award opportunity with a target of 30% of Base Salary (threshold of 15%; stretch of 60%). For January 1, 2008 through June 5, 2008, you will have an IC award opportunity with a target of 30% of Base Salary (threshold of 15%; stretch of 60%), prorated for the period January 1 to June 5, 2008. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof. It is expected that any IC awarded to you each year will be comprised of two parts. The first will be based on tasks or objectives assigned annually and measured by the Company's CEO. The second will be based on your performance as Chairman of the Board or on other duties assigned by the Board and will be measured by the Compensation Committee of the Board. 3.3 The Company's Compensation Committee has determined to grant to you as of the Effective Date, the following LTI grant pursuant to the ATMI 2003 Stock Plan: (i) an option to purchase 20,196 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price on that day in the form of Annex A (the "Option Grant Agreement"); and (ii) an award of 15,535 shares of restricted stock in the form of Annex B (the "Restricted Stock Grant Agreement"), which shall each be subject to Section 2.6 above. 3.4 The Company's Compensation Committee has determined to grant to you as of the Effective Date, the following Founder's Grant pursuant to the ATMI 2003 Stock Plan: an award of 88,871 shares of restricted stock in the form of Annex C (the "Director's Restricted Stock Grant Agreement"), which shall be subject to Section 2.6 above. 4. Other Benefits -------------- 4.1 You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy. 4.2 You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated officers or employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time. 4.3 The Company will reimburse you up to a maximum amount of $40,000 for tax, financial and legal professional fees incurred by you during calendar year 2005 in connection with this Agreement, subject to federal, state and local tax withholding. During the Term, the Company will reimburse the costs of a country club membership to the extent previously reimbursed by the Company. 4.4 Subject to Section 2.5, unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Cause or by you without Good Reason, following June 5, 2008 the Company, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, may assist you in securing health insurance coverage through the age of 70, including under the ATMI, Inc. Flexible Benefit Plan (the "Health Plan"), if then in place, or any other group health plan that ATMI may offer to its executives from time to time to 6
the extent the Health Plan or such other plan, as then in effect, provides for such post-termination coverage. You will be responsible for the entire cost of any such coverage. 4.5 You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options or restricted stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion. 4.6 You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company or ATMI Sub. 4.7 All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings. 5. Other Activities During Employment ---------------------------------- 5.1 Except with the prior written consent of the Board, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership on the Board of Zygo Corporation, membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 5.2 Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group. 5.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles. 6. Former Employment ----------------- 6.1 You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party. 7
6.2 You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company. 7. Confidentiality --------------- 7.1 You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as "Confidential Information" and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you. 7.2 Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties. 7.3 You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group. 7.4 The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement. 8. Post-Employment Activities -------------------------- 8.1 You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of 8
the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the later of (i) termination of your employment with the Company and (ii) termination of your membership on the Board of Directors of the Company, absent the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly: (a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development; (b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees; (c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Group's other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or (d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group. 8.2 Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s). 9. Remedies Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative. 9
10. Miscellaneous ------------- 10.1 This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof. 10.2 In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties expressly agree that a court may rewrite and modify such provisions so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear. 10.3 All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt) provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested, or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties): If to the Company: ATMI, Inc. 7 Commerce Drive Danbury, CT 06810 Facsimile No.: (203) 792-8040 Attention: Daniel P.

If either party shall waive any breach of any provision of this Agreement, such party shall not 10
thereby be deemed to have waived any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 10.5 The headings of the sections hereof are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof nor to affect the meaning hereof. 10.6 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed (both as to validity and performance) and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction. Any controversy arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach hereof shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the City of New York or in the State of Connecticut, pursuant to the rules and administration of JAMS. Such arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge of the United States District Court. The parties shall agree upon such arbitrator and the city in which the arbitration will take place no later than 30 days after the initiating party delivers to the other party written notice of its intention to arbitrate, which notice shall contain a detailed statement setting forth the nature of the dispute, the amount involved and the remedy sought. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator by such date, JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator who is a retired judge of the United States District Court. If the parties are unable to agree on a location by such date, the arbitration shall take place at JAMS' offices in New York, New York. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, except that in the event of any controversy relating to any violation or alleged violation of any provision of paragraph 7, 8 or 9, the Company in its sole discretion shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without any requirement to seek arbitration. Any decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any arbitral award may be enforced against the parties or their assets wherever they may be found. With regard to the adjudication of any suit, action or legal proceeding brought before a court in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, each party hereby agrees to accept the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Connecticut, and those of the United States of America situated in the State of Connecticut, and each party hereby irrevocably (1) agrees that any such suit, action or other legal proceeding may be brought in any Connecticut or United States federal court located in Connecticut; (2) consents to the jurisdiction of each such court in any such suit, action or legal proceeding; (3) waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or legal proceeding in any of such courts; and (4) agrees that Connecticut is the most convenient forum for litigation of any such suit, action or legal proceeding. 10.7 This Agreement, together with the Option Grant Agreement, the Restricted Stock Grant, the Director's Restricted Stock Grant Agreement and the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and may not be amended, supplemented, cancelled or discharged except by written instrument executed by both parties hereto. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior agreements between the Company and you with respect to the matters covered hereby. 10.8 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall constitute a complete and original instrument but all of which 11
together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and it shall not be necessary when making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart thereof to account for any other counterpart. 10.9 You acknowledge that you had the opportunity to have this Agreement reviewed by an attorney prior to your execution of this Agreement. 10.10 You will be entitled to full indemnification with respect to any and all claims and liabilities (and all related legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by you or on your behalf) asserted against you in your capacity as an officer or director of the Company or ATMI Sub or any member of the ATMI Group to the maximum extent provided in their charter documents as amended from time to time, copies of which (as to the Company and ATMI Sub) have been provided to you, and in accordance with Delaware law.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DANBURY, CT -- October 19, 2005 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of materials and materials packaging to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $69.7 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 8% from $64.4 million in the third quarter of 2004, and a 1% sequential increase from $69.3 million in the second quarter of 2005. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $8.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $6.4 million from continuing operations, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2004. Reported net income for the third quarter of 2004 was $10.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, from discontinued operations, all of which were sold during 2004, plus a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. The 2005 third quarter earnings per diluted share calculation includes the effect of the conversion of $115 million of convertible debt into an incremental 5.183 million common shares in April 2005. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, revenues were $205.1 million, an increase of 13% compared with revenues of $181.4 million for the same period of 2004. Net income was $22.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared with $16.2 million from continuing operations, or $0.51 per diluted share, last year. Reported net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $24.6 million, or $0.78 -more-

Doug Neugold, ATMI President and Chief Executive Officer, said "ATMI's third quarter revenue growth was somewhat disappointing given the strong wafer start environment and continued expansion of copper wafer production, which is now approaching 10% of all wafer starts. The reason is straightforward: our cleans materials did not ramp as we anticipated. In large part, this was a result of isolated delays in some new 90- and 65-nanometer production -- the normal fits and starts of leading and next-generation start-up manufacturing -- where we do the majority of our cleans business." Neugold continued, "As we proceed through the fourth quarter and into 2006, we are confident of ATMI's continued momentum at the leading edge. We have solid positions in the crucial copper-related materials enabling the most advanced processes. The continued ramping of 90-nanometer lines, and the expected ramp of 65-nanometer activities, should have a strong positive effect on our revenues. We anticipate revenues for the fourth quarter to be between $73 million and $78 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.22 and $0.27." Dan Sharkey, ATMI Chief Financial Officer said, "Gross margins were 50.4% for the quarter, compared with 50.6% in the third quarter of 2004, and 50.3% for the second quarter of 2005. Our leading edge materials-focused business model is now consistently generating cash. Our cash and marketable securities balances
ATMI Reports 3Q Financial Results & Announces Share Repurchase Plan -- Page 3 of 7 increased $3 million in the quarter after taking into account our $7.5 million cash investment in Anji Microelectronics in July." Share Repurchase Program Separately, ATMI announced that its Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to $75 million of ATMI common stock over the next twelve months. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. Management will determine the timing and amount of purchases under the program based upon market conditions or other factors. The program does not require ATMI to purchase any specific number or amount of shares and may be suspended or reinstated at any time at the Company's discretion and without notice.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2005 RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- FEBRUARY 8, 2006 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of specialty materials and high-purity materials handling and delivery solutions to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year 2005. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER 2005 Revenues were $76.7 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% from $64.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year, and up 10% sequentially from $69.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net income was $8.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter, compared with $6.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. Results for the fourth quarter of 2004 included earnings from continuing operations of $3.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, a gain of $3.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, on the disposal of discontinued operations, and a loss of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $8.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. RESULTS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2005 Revenues for 2005 were $281.8 million, up 14% from $246.3 million in 2004. Net income was $30.7 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in 2004, which included, on a diluted earnings per share basis, $0.64 from continuing operations, $0.10 from discontinued operations, and $0.26 from gains on disposal of discontinued operations. -- MORE --
ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2005 RESULTS -- PAGE 2 OF 6 COMMENTS Doug Neugold, ATMI's Chief Executive Officer, said, "We expect the strong growth in revenue and income from continuing operations we achieved in 2005 will continue in 2006, as a result of the expansion of 90-nanometer wafer starts by our key customers and the beginning of 65-nanometer processes ramping to volume production. For the past few years, including 2005, we have increased our joint development activities with the technology leaders across multiple semiconductor fabrication process steps. In 2006, as 65-nanometer processes begin to ramp, we expect this development work to result in higher commercial sales volume of new products." Dan Sharkey, ATMI's Chief Financial Officer, said, "ATMI's fourth quarter sequential revenue growth of 10% significantly exceeded industry growth, in line with our expectations, following relatively flat sequential growth in the previous quarter. For the full year, revenues grew 14%, about double our estimate of wafer start growth for the year of 7%." "While we were pleased with our top line growth in the fourth quarter, we are dissatisfied with our earnings performance. Although our gross margin of 50.2% for the full year was in line with our target range, our gross margin of 48.7% in the fourth quarter was about two percentage points lower than we expected. Our fourth quarter gross margin was negatively affected by unplanned freight and logistics costs to expedite product overseas, the remaining costs to complete the relocation of our liquids packaging manufacturing facility and, to a lesser extent, less favorable product mix during the period. Additionally, litigation expense and professional fees associated with Sarbanes-Oxley -- MORE --
ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2005 RESULTS -- PAGE 3 OF 6 compliance requirements caused higher selling, general, and administrative expenses than previously estimated. We expect that these costs will be considerably less in 2006," Sharkey said. As required under the new accounting rules, the company will begin to recognize expense for all its stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2006; the quarterly financial effect resulting from recognition of expense for all stock-based compensation in 2006 is estimated to be approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Commenting on the outlook for the full year 2006, CEO Doug Neugold said, "As we exit 2005, nearly 35% of our revenue comes from emerging technology nodes, which today means copper-based wafers. With copper wafer start growth estimated to be in excess of 25% in 2006, we expect to outperform our historical sales growth performance pattern of two times wafer starts. Current industry estimates indicate that overall worldwide wafer start growth will be 7%-8% in 2006. The growth and management of our product portfolio should help drive gross margin improvement such that, by the fourth quarter of 2006, our gross margin profile should be three to four percentage points higher than the gross margin level reported in this recently completed quarter. For the first quarter specifically, in a generally flat wafer start environment, we expect revenues in the $74 million to $79 million range with sequentially improved gross margin, and earnings, including the full effect of stock-based compensation of approximately $0.05 per diluted share, between $0.18 to $0.23 per diluted share." -- MORE --

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS REVENUES UP 16% ON STRONG CUSTOMER DEMAND DANBURY, CT -- APRIL 26, 2006 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of specialty materials and high-purity materials handling and delivery solutions to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $76.9 million for the first quarter of 2006, representing an increase of 16% from $66.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Net income for the quarter increased by 23% to $7.4 million, and earnings per share increased to $0.20 per diluted share, versus $0.19 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. Earnings per share includes share-based compensation expense of $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $0.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005, reflecting the adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenue growth was strong in the quarter. The 90-nanometer chip generation is starting to close in on its volume production sweet spot and 65-nanometer chip producers are at the beginning of some very steep production ramps, which bodes well for ATMI. Product development activity level with our key customers at 45-nanometer and 32-nanometer technology generations is also very high. As a result, we are enthusiastic about our growth outlook. Our focus on `innovation generation' has us in the middle of our customers' increasing demand for new, high performance semiconductor materials and materials packaging." - more -
ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS - PAGE 2 OF 6 Neugold continued, "Start-up inefficiencies while ramping a new, high-volume manufacturing line in our packaging operation negatively affected our gross margins in the quarter, more so than we expected; now, in the second quarter, that manufacturing line is rapidly approaching the efficiency levels we originally expected." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "We plan to increase shareholder value through margin expansion, not only with our consistently strong organic revenue growth, but also by driving process efficiency deeper into our, and our customers', operations. Internally, we focus on several key areas -- such as finance, supply chain management, manufacturing, shipping, and research and development -- in an effort to identify process efficiencies that will help us gain maximum operating leverage from our continuing revenue growth. Our expectation is that this will result in progressive improvement during 2006 in our profit margins and faster time-to-market for new product innovations. During the second quarter, we estimate revenues in the $77 million-$81 million range, with diluted earnings per share in the $0.21-$0.25 range." A conference call (800.289.0743) discussing financial results will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, April 26, 2006. A replay (888.203.1112, passcode 2417163) of the call will be available for 48 hours. An audio webcast of the conference call will be available for 30 days on atmi.com. 2

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ATMI REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS REVENUES UP 19% DANBURY, CT -- JULY 26, 2006 -- ATMI, INC. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of specialty materials and high-purity materials handling and delivery solutions to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $82.5 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 19% from $69.3 million in the second quarter of 2005. Net income for the quarter increased by 26% to $10.1 million from $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2005, and earnings per share increased to $0.27 per diluted share from $0.22 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005. Earnings per share includes share-based compensation expense of $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $0.01 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005, inclusive of the adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, revenues were $159.4 million, up 18% from $135.4 million in the comparable 2005 period. Net income increased 25% to $17.5 million from $14.0 million in the first half of 2005, and earnings per share increased to $0.46 per diluted share from $0.41 per diluted share for the first half of 2005. Earnings per share includes share-based compensation expense of $0.09 per share for the first half of 2006, compared to $0.02 per diluted share in the first half of 2005, inclusive of the adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our strong second quarter results reflect the momentum of both our advanced-generation chip
ATMI Reports Second Quarter 2006 Financial Results - Page 2 of 6 materials as well as our more broadly used products. We expect to see continued momentum and strong financial performance through the second half of the year as our customers continue to expand their 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer production volumes, even though global wafer start growth may flatten." Neugold continued, "Key customers are intensifying their efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and improve production throughput efficiencies, giving us significant opportunities to demonstrate how ATMI's products and technologies can improve their production yields, reduce their overall cost of manufacturing, and speed their time to market for new technology ramps." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "Strong SDS-3 volumes and higher cleaning materials shipments for advanced technology lines drove our strong revenue growth, highlighting our increasing new product sales. As expected, our gross margins for the second quarter increased sequentially from the first quarter, to 50.8% from 47.8%, in part reflecting that the inefficiencies resulting from ramping our new liquids packaging plant are behind us." Sharkey continued, "In light of our strong second quarter results and the prospect of a relatively flat wafer start environment, particularly at the foundries, we estimate third quarter revenues in the $80 to $85 million range, and diluted earnings per share in the $0.24 to $0.29 range. In the second quarter, ATMI purchased $18 million of stock under our previously announced $75 million share repurchase program, bringing the repurchase total to $42 million to date." A conference call (dial-in: 888.822.9375) discussing the company's

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ATMI REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS REVENUES UP 18% DANBURY, CT -- OCTOBER 25, 2006 -- ATMI, INC. (Nasdaq: ATMI), a supplier of specialty materials and high-purity materials handling and delivery solutions to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced revenues of $82.1 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 18% from $69.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net income for the quarter increased by 38% to $11.4 million from $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2005, and earnings per share increased to $0.31 per diluted share from $0.22 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005. Earnings per share includes a one-time $0.04 per diluted share tax benefit in 2006 and equity-based compensation expense of $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005, inclusive of the adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, revenues were $241.5 million, up 18% from $205.1 million in the comparable 2005 period. Net income increased 29% to $28.8 million from $22.3 million in the first nine months of 2005, and earnings per share increased to $0.77 per diluted share from $0.62 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2005. Earnings per share includes a one-time $0.04 per diluted share tax benefit in 2006 and equity-based compensation expense of $0.14 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2006, compared to $0.03 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2005, inclusive of the adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006.
ATMI REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- PAGE 2 of 7 Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our performance this quarter, as we achieved strong revenues during a period when flat panel display market demand temporarily softened and global wafer starts were relatively flat. We see continued strong demand for advanced generation materials, as well as materials that address some short term opportunities for the industry. In particular, we're experiencing great interest in our RegenSi(TM) wafer reclaim/ cleaning material, and our in-situ cleans technology for the implant process. Our ViaForm Extreme(TM) copper material was named a best-known process at another of our key customers, and we are seeing escalating interest for our NOWTrak(R) Radio Frequency Identification-based materials tracking solution from several of the world's leading integrated circuit producers. These are excellent examples of the importance our customers place on working with us to improve their process efficiency." Neugold continued, "We've had a fantastic response to our Asia Technology Development Center in Taiwan, which we officially opened in September during Semicon Taiwan. With Taiwan representing nearly 20% of ATMI's sales, and with more than 55% of our revenues coming from the Asia-Pacific region, the Center puts more materials expertise and support right where our customers have asked us to put it: locally." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "Revenues were up 18% year-over-year, reflecting the growth tied to our market position at the ramping 90 and 65 nanometer technology nodes. Gross margins were 51% on the strength of product mix momentum, compared with 50.4% a year ago. Operating margin has improved from 14.7% last year to 15.2% this year, even with the added effect of
ATMI REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- PAGE 3 of 7 over $2 million of equity-based compensation in 2006 pursuant to FAS 123(R). During the quarter, we recognized a non-recurring $1.7 million tax benefit, due to a provision adjustment arising from a change in certain facts and circumstances, which had a $0.04 per diluted share effect. Our balance sheet reflects continued share repurchases during the quarter, consistent with our expanded program, which added an additional $150 million authorization in August to our previous $75 million share repurchase plan. Through the end of the third quarter, we have deployed a total of $80 million on our repurchase programs." Sharkey continued, "Based on our assessment of the overall health of the industry and our market position in key sectors, despite what we believe will be a relatively flat wafer start environment, we are estimating fourth quarter revenues to range between $83 and $87 million, with diluted earnings per share in the $0.28 to $0.32 range."

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS. On December 13, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved grants of non-qualified stock options and performance-based restricted stock to Doug Neugold (CEO), Dan Sharkey (CFO), and Cynthia Shereda (CLO) under the Company's stock plans. The grants will be effective on January 2, 2007 (the "effective date"), with the number of options and shares of restricted stock (as the case may be) based on the value of the Company's common stock determined on the effective date. Mr. Neugold, Mr. Sharkey, and Ms. Shereda will receive a number of non-qualified options equal to $530,000, $200,000, and $112,500, respectively, divided by the Black-Scholes-Merton value of the Company's common stock on the effective date. The options will have an exercise price equal to the closing price on the effective date and will vest over a period of four years following the effective date in equal annual tranches. Mr. Neugold, Mr. Sharkey, and Ms. Shereda will also receive a number of shares of restricted stock with a theoretical maximum value (the "theoretical maximum") of $1,060,000, $400,000, and $225,000, respectively, based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the effective date. The restricted stock will be earned based upon the Company's achievement of operating income growth targets established annually by the Board of Directors. Actual shares earned will range from 0% to 100% of the theoretical maximum, with 50% being earned for "target" performance and 100% being earned for "stretch" performance, which will represent a significantly greater degree of difficulty over "target" and will depend upon the Company's ability to deliver growth well in excess of industry growth. Any restricted stock so earned will vest over a period of four years following the grant date in equal annual tranches. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 NASDAQ: ATMI ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- FEBRUARY 7, 2007 -- ATMI, INC. today reported revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter, revenues increased 10% to $84.4 million, compared with $76.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income increased 32% to $11.1 million, compared with $8.5 million a year earlier, while earnings per diluted share increased 41% to $0.31, compared to $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year, revenues increased 16% to $325.9 million, compared with $281.8 million in 2005. Net income for 2006 increased 30% to $40.0 million, compared with $30.7 million last year, and earnings per diluted share increased 27% to $1.08 versus $0.85 for 2005. Earnings per share results for 2006 include equity-based compensation expense of $0.03 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and $0.17 per diluted share for the full year, compared to $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $0.04 per diluted share for the full year 2005. "We continued to grow at double the rate of overall semiconductor manufacturing wafer starts in 2006, which reflects the importance our top-tier customers place on ATMI's process efficiency materials expertise and products," said Doug Neugold, Chief Executive Officer. "Key customers continue their longer term focus on advanced process technologies. As recent technical announcements -- MORE --
ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- PAGE 2 by leading device makers have made clear, semiconductor processing is about to step up to a new level of sophistication and complexity." Neugold continued, "Alongside the expansion of opportunities for ATMI in logic chips for the 45-nanometer generation, memory manufacturers are beginning to shift into copper materials, which should enhance our future growth. This year we will introduce several new process efficiency products -- like AutoClean(TM) for in-situ ion implantation chamber cleaning and RegenSi(TM) for wafer reclaim cleaning. These new processes have broad application in substantially reducing fab downtime across all technology generations, thereby offering significant value to customers and enlarging potential revenue opportunities for ATMI." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer, said, "ATMI's product sales were strong for the fourth quarter. Gross margins were 50.6% for the fourth quarter, up about 200 basis points year-over-year, although below the level we had targeted, as strong memory demand pulled through higher volumes of lower margin products." "Operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenues," Sharkey said. "Operating margins increased from 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2005 to 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006, including about $930,000 of incremental expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to FAS 123(R). We anticipate continued operating leverage from strong revenue growth resulting from our focus on new products and new value-added process efficiency solutions." "We are optimistic about our growth and performance outlook for 2007 and expect first quarter 2007 revenues in the range of $84 to $88 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.28 and $0.32." 2

EXHIBIT 991. ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ATMI REVISES FIRST QUARTER OUTLOOK DANBURY, CT -- MARCH 29, 2007 -- ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced a reduction in its first quarter financial guidance, and now estimates revenues will be between $80-$84 million and earnings per share in the $0.17-$0.21 range. The Company previously estimated revenues in the range of $84-$88 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.28-$0.32. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer said, "Our packaging business is experiencing a performance shortfall this quarter due to a manufacturing defect in one of its product lines which recently became apparent under certain use conditions. We are aggressively addressing this situation and working closely with our customers to minimize disruptions. Also contributing to our revised outlook is the incurring of certain operating expenses, e.g. litigation costs, earlier in the year than previously anticipated. Lastly, while the industry is experiencing soft seasonal wafer starts in Q1, we are achieving expected levels of sales in our materials product lines, though the product mix is contributing to a gross profit shortfall. Notwithstanding these short term issues, we remain confident about our new product initiatives and the growth outlook for our business over the balance of 2007." The Company plans to announce its first quarter financial results on April 25, 2007.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2007 FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- APRIL 25, 2007 -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATMI), today announced that revenues increased 7% to $82.2 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $76.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. Net income decreased 15% to $6.3 million, compared with $7.4 million a year ago, while earnings per diluted share were $0.18, compared with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. The results are within the revised guidance range communicated in the Company's March 29th press release. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our first quarter revenue was adversely affected by lower shipments in our packaging product line because of a product quality problem and softer-than-expected flat panel display market demand. The quality issue is being aggressively addressed, both internally and with our affected customers. However, it may have further effect on revenue in the second quarter, which is reflected in our guidance." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our first quarter profitability reflected the impact of the packaging quality issue, plus an unfavorable product mix in our materials business. In addition, certain operating expenses were incurred earlier in the year than originally anticipated, including various strategic R&D programs as well as incremental spending for ongoing patent litigation." Doug Neugold commented, "We are seeing a very high interest level in our new product offerings, and are also encouraged by the improving near-term wafer start growth expectations of many of our larger customers. For the second quarter, we estimate revenues in the $84 -$88 million range, with diluted earnings per share in the $0.22-$0.27 range." A conference call (888.822.9375) to discuss the company's first quarter financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, April 25, 2007. A replay (800.642.1687, passcode 6644185) of the call will be available for 48 hours. An audio webcast of the conference call will be available for 30 days on atmi.com. -- more --

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS DANBURY, CT -- JULY 25, 2007 -- ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced that revenues increased 12% to a record $92.4 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared with $82.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Net income decreased 8% to $9.3 million, compared with $10.1 million a year ago, while earnings per diluted share were $0.26, compared with $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, revenues were $174.6 million, up 10% from $159.4 million in the comparable 2006 period. Net income decreased 11% to $15.6 million from $17.5 million in the first half of 2006, and earnings per share decreased to $0.44 per diluted share from $0.46 per diluted share for the first half of 2006. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "This past quarter has been a good one for us. We began the quarter with a design quality problem in our packaging business and some costly, but important, ongoing patent litigation. During the quarter we solved the design problem and began refilling our supply chain with the redesigned product. On the legal front, our spending commitment for patent litigation to protect our intellectual property was rewarded by some recent success in the courts. Furthermore, the market environment for advanced logic production, which had been pretty weak since the middle of last year, strengthened noticeably in the quarter, complementing the strong memory environment of the last few quarters." Neugold continued, "Our significant R&D investments and new product efforts are generating a lot of interest. Our RegenSi(TM) wafer reclamation/cleaning materials are in use at multiple fabs by multiple -- MORE --
ATMI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2007 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- Page 2 of 6 customers. In addition, our AutoClean(TM) technology for ion implanters is delivering substantial improvements in source life, tool utilization, and throughput for multiple customers. Both products are now fully released and should contribute to our second half revenue growth." Dan Sharkey, Chief Financial Officer said, "Second quarter revenues benefited from strong end-of-quarter sales, principally driven by our SDS(R)3 product ramp, as well as healthy deposition chemistry delivery equipment sales into memory fabs. Revenues in our packaging business are also recovering. Our operating expenses were higher than we anticipated in the quarter, primarily due to a $1.1 million contingent legal fee payable as a result of the favorable ruling we achieved in June." Sharkey continued, "Initial SDS3 stocking orders were filled for several customers in the second quarter. However, SDS3 revenues in the third quarter are likely to be lower as those stocking orders are consumed and customer order patterns more closely reflect ongoing production. We estimate revenues in the $87 million to $92 million range for the third quarter, with diluted earning per share between $0.27 and $0.32." A conference call (dial-in: 888.822.9375) discussing the company's recent financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, July 25, 2007.

ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR. (a) On July 27, 2007, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") of ATMI, Inc. (the "Company"), effective as of the same date. The amendment and restatement, among other things, makes express the Company's ability to issue shares of the Company's securities in uncertificated form. By doing so, the Company has clarified its ability to meet the Direct Registration System ("DRS") requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. DRS allows shares of the Company' stock to be owned, reported and transferred electronically in uncertificated form and without the need for physical stock certificates. The amendment and restatement of the Bylaws implements certain further technical and/or clarifying changes or additions to the Bylaws, such as with respect to the transfer of uncertificated stock or the replacement of lost, stolen or destroyed share certificates with the issuance of shares in uncertificated form. The amendment and restatement of the Bylaws also makes express the authority to take certain actions through electronic transmissions, as permitted under Delaware corporate law, rather than in paper form. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, the Board or any committee thereof acting by unanimous consent, director resignations, waivers of notice and the granting of proxy authorizations. Previously, the Company's Bylaws were silent with respect to the Company's ability to issue shares in uncertificated form and the ability to take certain actions through electronic transmission. The summary above is qualified in its entirety by the Bylaws filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholder in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article IV hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). B. If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. C. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2
D. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. 2.4 Voting List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. In accordance with Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, nothing contained in this Section 2.4 shall be construed to require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network; provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (b) at the principal executive office of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of the shares held by each of them. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 2.5 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President) and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the request in writing of (a) a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office or (b) the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President). Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. 2.6 Quorum; Adjournments. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the shares represented thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a 3
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.7 Voting and Proxies. A. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting shall decide any matter brought before such meeting (subject to Section 2.5 in the case of any special meeting of stockholders), unless the matter is one upon which by an express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. B. Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum. C. Every person entitled to vote at a meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at any meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by written proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. D. Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. 2.8 No Stockholder Action By Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and no action by the stockholders may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 2.9 Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations. A. Annual Meetings of Stockholders. 4
(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) if specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.9, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.9. (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Section 2.9(A)(1)(c), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such an anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and held of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.9(A)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, at least seventy (70) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the 5
Secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. B. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 2.9(A)(2) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting, or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. C. General. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be eligible to serve as directors, and only such business as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by law or these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance herewith to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. (2) For purposes of this Section 2.9, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals 6
in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances. ARTICLE III DIRECTORS 3.1 Number; Election and Qualification. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3) nor more than fifteen (15). Thereafter, within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be increased or decreased upon the approval of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.6, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. 3.2 Classes of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible. No one class shall have more than one director more than any other class. 3.3 Terms in Office. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third succeeding annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. 3.4 Allocation of Directors Among Classes in the Event of Increases or Decreases in the Number of Directors. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of such director's current term or such director's prior death, retirement, removal or resignation and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors, subject to Section 3.2 and the following sentence. To the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the foregoing, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the full Board of Directors shall shorten the term of an incumbent director. 3.5 Tenure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. 3.6 Filling of Vacancies. Except as otherwise prescribed by law, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, or as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. A director 7
elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office, and a director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders at which directors of the class to which such position belongs are to be elected and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by law. 3.7 Powers of the Board. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled. 3.8 Resignation. Any director may resign by delivering his or her written resignation (including, without limitation, an electronic transmission) to the corporation at its principal office or to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. 3.9 Meetings. A. The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware. B. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. C. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary on five (5) days' notice to each director, either personally, by mail, by telegram, by facsimile, or by electronic mail; special meetings shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two or more directors (or one director if the Board of Directors consists of only one or two directors). Notice of any meeting may be deemed waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat. A notice or waiver of notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not specify the purposes of the meeting. 3.10 Quorum; Voting. At all meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, a majority of the directors of the full Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, except as a different vote may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or committee, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting 8
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. 3.11 Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. 3.12 Meetings by Telephone Conference Call. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.13 Committees. A. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the full Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. B. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. C. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to provisions of law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided that no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending these bylaws and, unless the resolution or the Certificate of Incorporation expressly so provides, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock. D. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. 3.14 Compensation of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors and to make grants and awards to directors under any stock option, restricted stock, or any other benefit plan in which directors may participate from time to time. Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors. 9
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, directors may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated fee as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation in connection with committee service. ARTICLE IV NOTICES 4.1 Notice to Stockholders. Whenever, under any provision of law or these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 4.2 Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in Section 4.1. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. The Secretary of the corporation shall make reasonable efforts to maintain updated contact information for each director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. 4.3 No Known Address. If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the principal executive office of the corporation. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and 10
the time at which such notice was directed to each such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained. 4.4 Timing. All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to directors by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the corporation. 4.5 Effect of Failure to Receive Notice. The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice. 4.6 Waiver. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent notice and shall constitute a waiver thereof. 4.7 Notice to the Corporation. Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation.

or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the corporation and registered in certificate form. 6.2 Stock Legends. Shares of stock which are subject to any restriction on transfer pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws or any agreement to which the corporation is a party, shall have conspicuously noted on the face or back of the certificate, or, in the case of uncertificated shares, included in each statement with respect to such shares that may be sent to the stockholder, either the full text of the restriction or a statement of the existence of such restriction and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the stockholder upon written request and without charge. When the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock, every certificate issued and every statement that may be sent to a holder of uncertificated shares, shall set forth either the full text of the preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special and relative rights of the shares of each class and series authorized to be issued or a statement of the existence of such preferences, powers, qualifications and rights and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the holder of such certificate upon written request and without charge. 6.3 Signatures on Certificates. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 6.4 Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner's legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 6.5 Transfer of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made on the books of the corporation after receipt of a request with proper evidence of succession, assignation, or authority to transfer by the record holder of such stock, or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate. Subject to the foregoing, the Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock of the corporation, and to appoint and remove transfer agents and registrars of transfers. 6.6 Fixing Record Date. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any 14
other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action shall be at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the date on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 6.7 Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VII GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1 Dividends. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of capital stock, subject to the provisions of applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation. 7.2 Reserves to Meet Contingencies.

ARTICLE VIII INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Article VIII: (1) "authorized representative" shall mean any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, any person serving at the request of the corporation (as defined below) and any person designated as an authorized representative by the board of directors or any officer of the corporation to whom the board of directors has delegated the authority to make such designations; (2) "corporate proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, proceeding under an alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor; (3) "criminal third party proceeding" shall include any action or investigation which could or does lead to a criminal third party proceeding; (4) "expenses" shall include attorneys' fees and disbursements; (5) "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (6) actions "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" shall include without limitation actions taken in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan; (7) "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; (8) "party" shall include the giving of testimony or similar involvement; (9) "serving at the request of the corporation" shall mean any person serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and (10) "third party proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal or administrative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation. 8.2 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Third Party Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the 16
corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any third party proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing, such third party proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any third party proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the authorized representative did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. 8.3 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Corporate Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any corporate proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal) such corporate proceeding, or preparing for any of the foregoing, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation except and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such corporate proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 8.4 Mandatory Indemnification of Authorized Representatives. To the extent that an authorized representative entitled to indemnification pursuant to 8.2 or 8.3 above has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any third party proceeding or corporate proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 17
8.5 Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article VIII, Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the board or directors that indemnification is proper in the circumstances. Such determination shall be made: A. by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding; or B. by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; or C. if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or D. by the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of the corporation's stockholders holding at least 50% of the then issued and outstanding shares of voting capital stock of the corporation. 8.6 Advancing Expenses. Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending a third party proceeding or corporate proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding and within thirty (30) days of receipt by the secretary of the corporation, if required by law, an undertaking by or on behalf of the authorized representative to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the authorized representative is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VIII or otherwise. Such expenses shall be so paid upon such other reasonable terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. The financial ability of any authorized representative to make a repayment contemplated by this section shall not be a prerequisite to the making of an advance. 8.7 Insurance. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an authorized representative against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. 8.8 Scope of Article VIII. The indemnification of authorized representatives and advancement of expenses, as authorized by the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an authorized representative and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 18
8.9 Reliance on Provisions. Each person who shall act as an authorized representative of the corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon rights of indemnification provided by this Article VIII. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the corporation or otherwise shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of an authorized representative existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 8.10 Severability. If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 8.11 Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the authorized representative, who, at the request of the corporation and at its sole cost and expense, shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 8.12 Intent of Article. The intent of this Article VIII is to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. To the extent that such Section or any successor section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article VIII shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS 9.1 By the Board of Directors. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws of the corporation. 9.2 By the Stockholders. Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, these bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least seventy percent (70%) of the shares of capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any regular meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders, acting as a single class, subject to any additional vote required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws, provided notice of such alteration, 19
amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws shall have been stated in the notice of such meeting. ARTICLE X VOTING OF SECURITIES OWNED BY THE CORPORATION All stock and other securities of other corporations or entities owned or held by the corporation for itself, or for other parties in any capacity, shall be voted, and all proxies with respect thereto shall be executed, by the person authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such authorization, by the Chairman of the Board (if there be such an officer appointed), or by the President, or, subject to Section 5.7, by any Vice President. ARTICLE XI OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates, may be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon, shall have ceased to be such officer of the corporation before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation. 20

(NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced revenues increased 11% to $91.1 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $82.1 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net income was $11.3 million, compared with $11.4 million a year ago, while earnings per diluted share were $0.32, compared with $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. Earnings in the third quarter of 2006 included a $1.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, tax benefit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, revenues were $265.7 million, up 10% from $241.5 million in the comparable 2006 period. Net income decreased 7% to $26.9 million compared with $28.8 million in the first nine months of 2006, and earnings per diluted share decreased to $0.76 from $0.77, which included the $0.04 per diluted share tax benefit in 2006. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Third quarter revenues reflect strength in memory, logic, and foundry semiconductor production, as well as improving materials packaging sales for flat panel applications, which have begun to rebound after a couple quarters of relatively flat results. Beyond improved wafer starts and flat panel strength, we are very encouraged by customer interest in our new, value-based process efficiency solutions." Neugold continued, "In particular, RegenSi and AutoClean are gaining customer acceptance, and we continue to expect significant revenue contribution from these and other non-node-specific products, in 2008." -- MORE --

Carlson continued, "Based on current market demand, momentum in our new product ramps, and customer penetration, we estimate revenues for the fourth quarter in the range of $91 million to $96 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.31 and $0.36." Share repurchases were $22.7 million in the third quarter and $45.6 million in the first nine months of 2007.

EXHIBIT 3.1 ----------- ATMI, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS (EFFECTIVE AS OF JULY 27, 2007) ------------------------------------------------------ ARTICLE I OFFICES 1.1 Registered Office. The registered office shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. 1.2 Other Offices. The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the board of directors of the corporation (the "Board of Directors") may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require. ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 2.1 Place of Meetings. A. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors shall be held at such place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. Meetings of stockholders for any other purpose may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. B. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting of the stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication; provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of 1
remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation. 2.2 Annual Meeting. Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held on such date no more than 13 months following the date of the preceding annual meeting (which date shall not be a legal holiday in the place where the meeting is to be held) and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which (subject to the quorum requirements set forth in Section 2.6), except as otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the stockholders shall elect, by a plurality vote of the shares represented in person or by proxy, directors to succeed those whose terms are expiring, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. 2.3 Notice of Meetings. A. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholder in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article IV hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). B. If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. C. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2
D. Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. 2.4 Voting List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. In accordance with Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, nothing contained in this Section 2.4 shall be construed to require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network; provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (b) at the principal executive office of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of the shares held by each of them. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 2.5 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President) and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the request in writing of (a) a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office or (b) the Chairman of the Board (or, if none is designated, the President). Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. 2.6 Quorum; Adjournments. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the shares represented thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a 3
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.7 Voting and Proxies. A. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting shall decide any matter brought before such meeting (subject to Section 2.5 in the case of any special meeting of stockholders), unless the matter is one upon which by an express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. B. Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum. C. Every person entitled to vote at a meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at any meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by written proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. D. Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. 2.8 No Stockholder Action By Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and no action by the stockholders may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 2.9 Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations. A. Annual Meetings of Stockholders. 4
(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) if specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.9, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.9. (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Section 2.9(A)(1)(c), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such an anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and held of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.9(A)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, at least seventy (70) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the 5
Secretary at the principal executive office of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. B. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 2.9(A)(2) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting, or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. C. General. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be eligible to serve as directors, and only such business as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by law or these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance herewith to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. (2) For purposes of this Section 2.9, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals 6
in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances. ARTICLE III DIRECTORS 3.1 Number; Election and Qualification. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3) nor more than fifteen (15). Thereafter, within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be increased or decreased upon the approval of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.6, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. 3.2 Classes of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible. No one class shall have more than one director more than any other class. 3.3 Terms in Office. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third succeeding annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. 3.4 Allocation of Directors Among Classes in the Event of Increases or Decreases in the Number of Directors. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of such director's current term or such director's prior death, retirement, removal or resignation and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors, subject to Section 3.2 and the following sentence. To the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the foregoing, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the full Board of Directors shall shorten the term of an incumbent director. 3.5 Tenure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. 3.6 Filling of Vacancies. Except as otherwise prescribed by law, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, or as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. A director 7
elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office, and a director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders at which directors of the class to which such position belongs are to be elected and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by law. 3.7 Powers of the Board. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled. 3.8 Resignation. Any director may resign by delivering his or her written resignation (including, without limitation, an electronic transmission) to the corporation at its principal office or to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. 3.9 Meetings. A. The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware. B. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. C. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary on five (5) days' notice to each director, either personally, by mail, by telegram, by facsimile, or by electronic mail; special meetings shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two or more directors (or one director if the Board of Directors consists of only one or two directors). Notice of any meeting may be deemed waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat.

At all meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, a majority of the directors of the full Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, except as a different vote may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or committee, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting 8
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. 3.11 Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. 3.12 Meetings by Telephone Conference Call. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.13 Committees.

Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. B. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. C.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, directors may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated fee as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation in connection with committee service. ARTICLE IV NOTICES 4.1 Notice to Stockholders. Whenever, under any provision of law or these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 4.2 Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in Section 4.1. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. The Secretary of the corporation shall make reasonable efforts to maintain updated contact information for each director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. 4.3 No Known Address. If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the principal executive office of the corporation. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and 10
the time at which such notice was directed to each such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained. 4.4 Timing. All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to directors by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the corporation. 4.5 Effect of Failure to Receive Notice. The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice. 4.6 Waiver. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent notice and shall constitute a waiver thereof. 4.7 Notice to the Corporation. Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation.

The Vice President shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. 5.8 Secretary.

ARTICLE VI STOCK 6.1 Certificated or Uncertificated Shares. Shares of the corporation's stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock or may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. The issuance of shares in uncertificated form shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of stock in the corporation that is represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the Chairman of the Board (if there be such an officer appointed) or vice chairman of the Board of Directors, or by the President or any Vice President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary 13
or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the corporation and registered in certificate form. 6.2 Stock Legends. Shares of stock which are subject to any restriction on transfer pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws or any agreement to which the corporation is a party, shall have conspicuously noted on the face or back of the certificate, or, in the case of uncertificated shares, included in each statement with respect to such shares that may be sent to the stockholder, either the full text of the restriction or a statement of the existence of such restriction and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the stockholder upon written request and without charge. When the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock, every certificate issued and every statement that may be sent to a holder of uncertificated shares, shall set forth either the full text of the preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special and relative rights of the shares of each class and series authorized to be issued or a statement of the existence of such preferences, powers, qualifications and rights and a statement that the corporation will furnish a copy thereof to the holder of such certificate upon written request and without charge. 6.3 Signatures on Certificates. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 6.4 Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner's legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 6.5 Transfer of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made on the books of the corporation after receipt of a request with proper evidence of succession, assignation, or authority to transfer by the record holder of such stock, or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate. Subject to the foregoing, the Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock of the corporation, and to appoint and remove transfer agents and registrars of transfers. 6.6 Fixing Record Date. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any 14
other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action shall be at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the date on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 6.7 Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VII GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1 Dividends. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting.

Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside, out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall deem conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created. 7.3 Checks. All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate. 7.4 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. 7.5 Corporate Seal.

ARTICLE VIII INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Article VIII: (1) "authorized representative" shall mean any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, any person serving at the request of the corporation (as defined below) and any person designated as an authorized representative by the board of directors or any officer of the corporation to whom the board of directors has delegated the authority to make such designations; (2) "corporate proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, proceeding under an alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor; (3) "criminal third party proceeding" shall include any action or investigation which could or does lead to a criminal third party proceeding; (4) "expenses" shall include attorneys' fees and disbursements; (5) "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (6) actions "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" shall include without limitation actions taken in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan; (7) "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; (8) "party" shall include the giving of testimony or similar involvement; (9) "serving at the request of the corporation" shall mean any person serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and (10) "third party proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing or investigation, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal or administrative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation. 8.2 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Third Party Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the 16
corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any third party proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing, such third party proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any third party proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the authorized representative did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. 8.3 Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Corporate Proceedings. As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any corporate proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal) such corporate proceeding, or preparing for any of the foregoing, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation except and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such corporate proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 8.4 Mandatory Indemnification of Authorized Representatives. To the extent that an authorized representative entitled to indemnification pursuant to 8.2 or 8.3 above has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any third party proceeding or corporate proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 17
8.5 Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article VIII, Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the board or directors that indemnification is proper in the circumstances. Such determination shall be made: A. by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding; or B. by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; or C. if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or D. by the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of the corporation's stockholders holding at least 50% of the then issued and outstanding shares of voting capital stock of the corporation. 8.6 Advancing Expenses. Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending a third party proceeding or corporate proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such third party proceeding or corporate proceeding and within thirty (30) days of receipt by the secretary of the corporation, if required by law, an undertaking by or on behalf of the authorized representative to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the authorized representative is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VIII or otherwise. Such expenses shall be so paid upon such other reasonable terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. The financial ability of any authorized representative to make a repayment contemplated by this section shall not be a prerequisite to the making of an advance. 8.7 Insurance. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an authorized representative against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. 8.8 Scope of Article VIII. The indemnification of authorized representatives and advancement of expenses, as authorized by the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an authorized representative and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 18
8.9 Reliance on Provisions. Each person who shall act as an authorized representative of the corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon rights of indemnification provided by this Article VIII. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the corporation or otherwise shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of an authorized representative existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 8.10 Severability. If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 8.11 Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the authorized representative, who, at the request of the corporation and at its sole cost and expense, shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 8.12 Intent of Article. The intent of this Article VIII is to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. To the extent that such Section or any successor section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article VIII shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS 9.1 By the Board of Directors. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws of the corporation. 9.2 By the Stockholders. Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, these bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least seventy percent (70%) of the shares of capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any regular meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders, acting as a single class, subject to any additional vote required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws, provided notice of such alteration, 19
amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws shall have been stated in the notice of such meeting. ARTICLE X VOTING OF SECURITIES OWNED BY THE CORPORATION All stock and other securities of other corporations or entities owned or held by the corporation for itself, or for other parties in any capacity, shall be voted, and all proxies with respect thereto shall be executed, by the person authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such authorization, by the Chairman of the Board (if there be such an officer appointed), or by the President, or, subject to Section 5.7, by any Vice President. ARTICLE XI OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates, may be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon, shall have ceased to be such officer of the corporation before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation. 20

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ATMI ACQUIRES LEVTECH EXTENDING DISPOSABLE TECHNOLOGIES MARKET LEADERSHIP IN LIFE SCIENCES DANBURY, CT -- JANUARY 7, 2008 -- ATMI, INC. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced it has acquired LevTech, Inc., a market-leading provider of disposable mixing technologies to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in a $27 million cash transaction. Based in Lexington, Kentucky, LevTech will be combined with ATMI's existing LifeSciences business focused on single-use bioprocess containers and processes for the biopharmaceutical industry. "The addition of LevTech's innovative products, intellectual property, and market share puts ATMI's LifeSciences business in a preeminent position for single-use manufacturing applications in the biopharmaceutical market," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer. "This transaction is indicative of our intent to focus on providing process efficiency solutions to this market as another source of significant growth for ATMI." "ATMI's experience in single-use flexible process containers is unparalleled," said Mario Philips, General Manager of ATMI LifeSciences. "We've supplied the semiconductor industry with ultra-high purity single-use containers since 1987, and, since 1999, growing customer demand has led us to extend our expertise to the biopharmaceutical industry. This acquisition supports our strategy to become the global leader in comprehensive disposable systems for the -- MORE --

"LevTech has successfully developed proprietary mixing technologies to enable critical processes in the fast-emerging single-use biopharmaceutical manufacturing market," said Jeffery Craig, LevTech Chairman. "We have secured a leading global position by providing our customers with validated and sustainable cost, capacity, contamination, and time-to-market advantages. Combining LevTech's patent-protected biomanufacturing products with ATMI's ultra-clean technology experience, single-use container manufacturing capacity, and global infrastructure will create what we believe will be the worldwide market leader in the single-use bioprocessing arena." "We expect this deal to be accretive by late 2008 as expected revenue growth and operating synergies offset anticipated intangible asset amortization and lower interest income," said Tim Carlson, ATMI Chief Financial Officer. "We expect slight near-term EPS dilution of $0.01 - $0.02 per quarter as we integrate the acquisition during the year."

DANBURY, CT -- FEBRUARY 6, 2008 -- ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007. 4TH QUARTER 2007 RESULTS Revenues increased 17% to $98.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $84.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating income increased 37% to $18.2 million, compared with $13.3 million a year ago, while earnings per diluted share were $0.40, compared with $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased by 280 basis points to 18.5%, compared with 15.7% for the fourth quarter a year earlier and 16.6% for the third quarter of 2007. 2007 FULL YEAR RESULTS For the year ended December 31, 2007, revenues were $364.1 million, up 12% from $325.9 million in 2006.

ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2007 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- PAGE 2 OF 7 Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "We dealt with some challenging business conditions early in 2007, yet ended the year with very strong momentum, both in product sales and customer relationships. We put a new customer-focused organization in place and introduced several potentially game-changing products, including AutoClean(TM) and RegenSi(TM), which have established encouraging traction as we exit 2007." "Looking forward to 2008 and beyond, there are some industry challenges that we think create significant opportunities for ATMI. The increasing technological complexity of advanced chips is driving development costs to unprecedented levels. The strategic investments we made in 2007 in high throughput research and development capabilities are helping us to transform the development process, for both materials and the processes in which they are used. To fully capitalize on this opportunity, we are aggressively expanding our capability through investment in additional toolsets from Intermolecular, Inc. as well as the formation of a broader alliance focused on multiple key customers." Neugold continued, "Leveraging ATMI's industry-leading advanced materials portfolio, supply chain, and customer relationships with Intermolecular's highly efficient and effective technology platform should enable the leading integrated circuit producers to materially improve their return on development investments through lower direct costs and significantly reduced capital investments. The benefits for ATMI should include compressed product development cycles, significant expansion of our product portfolio and increased revenues, as well as longer term efficiency in our own research and development spending."
ATMI REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2007 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- PAGE 3 OF 7 Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer said, "We finished 2007 with strong financial performance and believe the two recent strategic initiatives we've begun present great opportunities for further growth. The acquisition of LevTech expands our process efficiency expertise in single-use manufacturing reactors and consumables used in the bio-pharmaceutical market and should enable us to significantly accelerate our growth in this market." "Our high throughput research and development investment includes establishing development platforms close to our key customers in multiple global locations. This expanded investment will drive an additional $6 million of research and development expense in 2008, which will begin ramping in the second quarter. While the combined LevTech and high throughput research and development investments will reduce our 2008 earnings by approximately $0.15 per diluted share, we expect to see the positive financial effect from these investments beginning in 2009." Summarizing the outlook for 2008, Carlson concluded, "Given the anticipated market growth, the prospects for new product introductions, and the initial effect from our strategic investments, we expect our revenues to be in the $400 to $420 million range, and earnings per diluted share in the $1.32 to $1.48 range." A conference call (dial-in: 888.822.9375) discussing the company's recent financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, February 6, 2008.

Generally, a Non-Employee Director incurs a Separation from Service upon termination of service as a Non-Employee Director of the Company. For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, the Company means the Company and any company that is in the same controlled group with the Company as defined for purposes of Code ss.414(b) and (c), except that for purposes of determining whether another organization is in the same controlled group, common ownership of at least 50% shall be determinative. (m) "Unforeseeable Emergency" means a severe financial hardship to the Non-Employee Director resulting from an illness or accident of the Non-Employee Director, the Non-Employee Director's spouse, the Non-Employee Director's dependent (as defined in Code ss.152(a)), or a Beneficiary; loss of the Non-Employee Director's property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home
following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance, for example, as a result of a natural disaster); or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Non-Employee Director. (n) "Committee" means the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. III. SECTION 2.2, GRANT OF STOCK CREDITS, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: Each person who serves as a Non-Employee Director shall have his or her Stock Account credited with Stock Credits as herein described. Each Non-Employee Director may elect prior to the beginning of a calendar year to participate in the Program and to defer some or all of the Compensation such Non-Employee Director will earn during such calendar year, in accordance with the terms of this Program. Such deferral elections are irrevocable as of December 31st of the year preceding the year in which the Compensation is earned. With respect to the first year that a Non-Employee Director becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, such Non-Employee Director may elect within 30 days of becoming eligible to participate in this Program, to become a Participant in the Program and defer some or all of the Compensation such Non-Employee Director will earn during the remainder of such calendar year, in accordance with the terms of this Program. Such deferral elections are irrevocable at the end of the 30 day period and shall apply only to Compensation earned after the end of the 30 day period. The determination of whether a Non-Employee Director may elect to defer Compensation under this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Code ss.409A and related Treasury Regulations, including Treasury Regulations ss.1.409A-2(a)(7). Stock Credits with respect to Compensation shall be established on each Deferral Date in an amount equal to the (A) Compensation that would have been paid to a Participant on such Deferral Date but for the Participant's election to defer all or a portion of such Compensation pursuant to the Program, divided by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Deferral Date. IV. SECTION 3.1, TIME AND METHOD OF PAYMENT, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: Distribution of the Stock Account of a Participant shall be made to such Participant on the 15th day (or the first Business Day thereafter) of the first calendar month following such Participant's Separation from Service as a director of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as of the Separation from Service date, the Participant is a "specified employee" as defined for purposes of Code ss.409A as a result of prior or current employmenT with the Company, distribution shall be made as of the first Business Day of the first month following the date that is six months after the Participant's Separation from Service date. In no event may a Participant designate the timing or year of any payment made pursuant to this Section 3.1. Distribution of a Participant's Stock Account shall be made, subject to Section 3.4, in a single installment in that number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of Stock Credits in the Participant's Stock Account on the date of distribution, except that the value of any fractional share shall be paid in cash based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of distribution. 2
V. SECTION 3.2, SEVERE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: Notwithstanding any other Section of this Article 3, at the written request of a Participant or a Participant's legal representative, the Committee, upon a finding that, because of an Unforeseeable Emergency, continued deferral will result in a severe financial hardship to the Participant, shall cancel the deferral election of the Participant for the remainder of the then current year, and may authorize the payment of all or a part of a Participant's Stock Account, subject to Section 3.4, in shares of Common Stock, in a single installment prior to the distribution date for such Stock Account under Section 3.1 or Section 3.3. Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting the cancellation of further deferrals and a distribution under this Section 3.2 shall be determined by the Committee (other than the Participant requesting the distribution) based on the relevant facts and circumstances, but, in any case, a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under this Plan. If a distribution is approved by the Committee, the amount of the payment shall not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the need, taking into account the additional compensation that is available to the Participant as the result of cancellation of deferrals to the Plan, including amounts necessary to pay any taxes or penalties that the Participant reasonably anticipates will result from the payment. Distributions under this Section 3.2 shall be paid in a single lump sum within the 90-day period following the date the payment is approved by the Committee. In no event shall the Participant have a right to designate the taxable year of the payment. VI. SECTION 3.3, DISTRIBUTIONS UPON DEATH, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Program, upon the death of a Participant, the Committee shall authorize the Company to distribute, subject to Section 3.4 hereof, all of such Participant's Stock Account to such person or persons as the Participant may have designated. All such designations shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Committee and delivered to the Committee. A Participant may from time to time revoke or change any such designation by written notice to the Committee. If there is no designation on file with the Committee at the time of the Participant's death, or if the person or persons designated therein shall not be living or otherwise have ceased to exist as of the payment date, the distribution shall be made to the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.3, the distribution shall be made in accordance with Section 3.1, above. VII. SECTION 5.4, AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION OF THE PROGRAM, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: The Board at any time may amend or modify the Program in any respect; provided, however, that (A) no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary, including his or her rights with respect to Stock Credits credited prior to such amendment or modification, without his or her consent; and (b) no such amendment or modification shall permit the acceleration or delay of a distribution hereunder except as permitted under Code ss.409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may terminate the Program and pay Participants (or their beneficiaries) their 3
accrued benefits in a single lump sum at any time, to the extent and in accordance with Treasury Regulation ss.1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix). VIII. EFFECT AND EFFECTIVE DATE. The foregoing amendments, made on March 2, 2008, shall supersede the provisions of the Program to the extent that those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of these amendments. The provisions of the Program, as amended by this amendment, are intended to comply in all respects with, and shall be interpreted in such a manner as to comply with, Code ss.409A and regulations thereunder.

EXHIBIT 10.4 ATMI, INC. 2003 STOCK PLAN (AS AMENDED MAY 21, 2003 AND MARCH 2, 2008) SECTION 1 PURPOSE The purpose of the 2003 Stock Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for ATMI, Inc. (the "Company"), its parent (if any) and any subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "Related Companies") the benefits arising from capital stock ownership and the receipt of capital stock-based incentives by those employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies who will be responsible for the Company's future growth and continued success. The Plan will provide a means whereby (a) employees of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options which qualify as "incentive stock options" ("Incentive Stock Options") under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); (b) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options granted hereunder which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Non-Qualified Options"); (c) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (d) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may be awarded stock in the Company ("Awards"); and (e) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive shares of stock in the Company that are subject to restrictions on transferability and may be forfeited ("Restricted Stock"). Both Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Options are referred to hereafter individually as an "Option" and collectively as "Options." As used herein, the terms "parent" and "subsidiary" mean "parent corporation" and "subsidiary corporation" as those terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code. Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock are referred to hereafter individually as a "Plan Benefit" and collectively as "Plan Benefits." Directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies are referred to herein as "Participants." SECTION 2 ADMINISTRATION 2.1 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE COMMITTEE. The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company whose construction and interpretation of the terms and provisions hereof shall be final and conclusive. Any director to whom a Plan Benefit is awarded shall be ineligible to vote upon his or her Plan Benefit, but Plan Benefits may be granted to any such director by a vote of the remainder of the directors, except as limited below. The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion grant Options, issue shares upon exercise of such Options and grant SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock, all as provided in the Plan. The Board of Directors shall have authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to construe the Plan and its related agreements, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of the respective Option, SAR, Award and Restricted Stock agreements, which need not be identical, and to make all other
determinations in the judgment of the Board of Directors necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Plan, the Board may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to designate the Participants (other than such officer(s)) who will receive Options, SARs, Awards or Restricted Stock under the Plan and the size and terms of each such grant, to the fullest extent permitted by ss.157 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or any successor provision thereto). The Board of Directors may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of any such expediency. No director shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith. The Board of Directors may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to a Compensation Committee or other Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors consisting of at least two members of the Board of Directors. While it is intended that at all times that the Committee acts in connection with the Plan all the members of the Committee shall be: (i) "outside directors" as that term is defined in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(3) (or any successor regulation); and (ii) "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as such terms are interpreted from time to time, the fact that the Committee is not so comprised will not invalidate the grant of any Plan Benefit that otherwise satisfies the terms of the Plan. If the Committee is so appointed, all references to the Board of Directors herein shall mean and relate to such Committee, unless the context otherwise requires. 2.2 COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 162(M) OF THE CODE. Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits the tax deductibility to publicly held companies of compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain "covered employees" ("Covered Employees"). It is the Company's intention to preserve the deductibility of such compensation to the extent it is reasonably practicable and to the extent it is consistent with the Company's compensation objectives. For purposes of this Plan, Covered Employees of the Company shall be those employees of the Company described in Section 162(m)(3) of the Code. 2.3 COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A OF THE CODE. To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder provides for the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Code ss.409A and related regulations), other than in accordance with the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan, the material terms of the deferral, to the extent required under Treasury Regulation ss.1.409A-1(c)(3) to establish a deferred compensation plan, shall be set forth in the written documentation of the Plan Benefit (including by incorporation by reference, if applicable) prior to the effective date of such award or grant. To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder does not provide for a deferral of compensation, but may be deferred under the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (or other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of the Company), the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (or such other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of the Company) shall govern the deferral and, to the extent necessary, are incorporated herein by reference. 2
SECTION 3 ELIGIBILITY 3.1 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Participants who are employees of the Company and any Related Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options pursuant to the Plan; provided that no person shall be granted an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan who, at the time such Option is granted, owns, directly or indirectly, Common Stock of the Company possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its Related Companies, unless the requirements of Section 6.6(b) hereof are satisfied. In determining whether this 10% threshold has been reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply. Directors who are not regular employees are not eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options. 3.2 NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS, SARS, AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. Non-Qualified Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock may be granted to any Participant. 3.3 GENERALLY. The granting of Plan Benefits is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take into consideration a Participant's individual circumstances in determining whether to grant an Incentive Stock Option, a Non-Qualified Option, SAR, Award or Restricted Stock. Granting of any Plan Benefit to any Participant shall neither entitle that Participant to, nor disqualify that Participant from, participation in any other grant of Plan Benefits. SECTION 4 STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 9 and 10 hereof, the stock to be offered under the Plan shall consist of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $.01 par value, and the maximum number of shares which will be reserved for issuance, and in respect of which Plan Benefits may be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall not exceed in the aggregate 3,000,000 shares. Such shares may be authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market. If an Option or SAR granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or if a share issued or issuable pursuant to an Award or share of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited, the unpurchased or forfeited shares subject thereto shall again be available for subsequent grants of Plan Benefits under the Plan. Stock issued pursuant to the Plan may be subject to such restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights or other restrictions as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. SECTION 5 GRANTING OF OPTIONS, SARS, AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK Plan Benefits may be granted under the Plan at any time after May 21, 2003 (the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company) and prior to May 21, 2013; provided, however, that nothing in the Plan shall be construed to obligate the Company to grant Plan Benefits to a Participant or anyone claiming under or through a Participant. The date of grant of Plan Benefits under the Plan will be the date specified by the Board of Directors at the time the Board of Directors grants such Plan Benefits; provided, however, that such date shall not be prior to the date on which the Board of Directors takes such action. The Board of Directors shall have the right, with the consent of a 3
Participant, to convert an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan to a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7. Any Plan Benefit may be granted alone or in addition to other Plan Benefits granted under the Plan. SECTION 6 PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO OPTIONS AND SARS 6.1 PURCHASE PRICE AND SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTIONS AND SARS. (a) The purchase price per share of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that, except as modified in Section 6.6(b) hereof, the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of such Common Stock on the day the Option is granted. (b) Options granted under the Plan may provide for the payment of the exercise price by delivery of (i) cash or a check payable to the order of the Company in an amount equal to the exercise price of such Options, (ii) shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the Participant having a fair market value equal in amount to the exercise price of the Options being exercised, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii). The fair market value of any shares of the Company's Common Stock which may be delivered upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof. To the extent permitted by law, the Board of Directors may also permit Participants, either on a selective or aggregate basis, to simultaneously exercise Options and sell the shares of Common Stock thereby acquired, pursuant to a brokerage or similar arrangement approved in advance by the Board of Directors, and to use the proceeds from such sale as payment of the exercise price of such shares. (c) If, at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" of a share of the Company's Common Stock for a specific date shall mean (i) the average (on such date) of the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is traded, if such Common Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange; (ii) the last reported sale price (on such date) of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market if the Common Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the closing bid price (or average of bid prices) last quoted (on such date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Common Stock is not reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market. If the Company's Common Stock was not traded on the date in issue, fair market value shall be determined as of the last preceding business day for which such prices or quotes are available. However, if the Common Stock is not publicly traded at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, "fair market value" shall be deemed to be the fair value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors after taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Common Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length. 4
(d) The maximum number of shares with respect to which Options or SARs may be granted to any employee, including any transactions contemplated by Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(2)(vi), shall be limited to 112,500 shares in any calendar year. 6.2 DURATION OF OPTIONS AND SARS. Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR and all rights thereunder shall expire on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, but in no event later than ten years from the day on which the Option or SAR is granted. 6.3 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND SARS. (a) Subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times and during such period or periods as shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing such Option or SAR. To the extent that an Option or SAR is not exercised by a Participant when it becomes initially exercisable, it shall not expire but shall be carried forward and shall remain exercisable, on a cumulative basis, until the expiration of the exercise period. No partial exercise may be for less than ten (10) full shares of Common Stock (or its equivalent). (b) The Board of Directors shall have the right to accelerate the date on which any installment of any Option or SAR first becomes exercisable; provided that, without the Participant's written consent, the Board of Directors shall not accelerate the date on which any installment of any Incentive Stock Option (not previously converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7) first becomes exercisable if such acceleration would violate the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d)(1) of the Code, which provides generally that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted to any Participant are exercisable for the first time by such Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000. 6.4 NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS AND SARS. No Option or SAR granted under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Non-Qualified Options and SARs, unless the Participant's non-qualified stock option agreement granting such options (the "Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement") or the Participant's SAR agreement granting such SARs (the "SAR Agreement") provides otherwise. Unless otherwise provided by the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or the SAR Agreement, as applicable, during the life of the Participant, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable only by the Participant. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Options or SARs, other than in accordance with the applicable terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or SAR Agreement, the Participant's interest in such Options or SARs shall terminate. 6.5 EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR DEATH ON OPTIONS AND SARS. 5
(a) Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or a Related Company for any reason, including retirement but other than death, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall immediately terminate; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any portion of such Option or SAR which was otherwise exercisable on the date of termination of the Participant's employment may be exercised within the three-month period following the date on which the Participant ceased to be so employed, but in no event after the expiration of the exercise period. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any such exercise may be made only to the extent of the number of shares subject to the Option or SAR which were purchasable or exercisable on the date of such termination of employment. If the Participant dies during such three-month period, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees to the same extent and during the same period that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit. (b) Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant dies while an employee of the Company or any Related Company, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, for the purchase of or exercise relative to that number of shares and to the same extent that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, the Option or SAR or any unexercised portion thereof shall terminate unless so exercised prior to the earlier of the expiration of six months from the date of such death or the expiration of the exercise period. (c) For the purpose of the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5, a Participant shall be deemed to have ceased employment upon (i) the date the Participant ceases to be employed by, or to provide consulting services for, the Company or a Related Company, or any corporation (or any of its subsidiaries) which assumes the Participant's Options or SARs in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies; (ii) the date the Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Company; or (iii) in the case of a Participant who is, at the time of reference, both an employee or consultant and a Board member, the later of the dates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above. For purposes of clause (i) above, a Participant who continues his employment or consulting relationship with a Related Company subsequent to its sale by the Company shall have a termination of employment upon the date of such sale. The Board of Directors may in its discretion determine, in accordance with applicable laws, whether any leave of absence or absence in military or government service constitutes a cessation of employment for purposes of the Plan and the impact, if any, of any such leave of absence on Options and SARs theretofore granted under the Plan. Such determinations of the Board of Directors shall be final and conclusive. A person whose status changes from consultant, employee, or member of the Board to any other of such positions without interruption shall not be considered to have ceased employment by reason of such change. 6
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that it remains exercisable for more than three months after the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any Related Company for any reason other than death (unless death occurs within the three months following such termination of employment) or disability, or for more than one year following a Participant's ceasing to be an employee as the result of becoming disabled, even if the Participant continues to be affiliated with the Company as a director or consultant. 6.6 DESIGNATION OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS; LIMITATIONS. Options granted under the Plan which are intended to be Incentive Stock Options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code shall be designated as Incentive Stock Options and shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: (a) Dollar Limitation. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the Common Stock for which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year by any person under the Plan (and all other incentive stock option plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000. In the event that Section 422(d)(1) of the Code is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein so that following such amendment such limitation shall differ from the limitation set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the limitation of this Section 6.6(a) shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. An Option shall be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that this limitation is exceeded. (b) 10% Stockholder. If any Participant to whom an Incentive Stock Option is to be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan is on the date of grant the owner of stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Companies, then the following special provisions shall be applicable to the Incentive Stock Option granted to such individual: (i) The option exercise price per share of the Common Stock subject to such Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof; and (ii) The option exercise period shall not exceed five years from the date of grant. In determining whether the 10% threshold has been reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply. (c) Except as modified by the preceding provisions of this Section 6.6, all of the provisions of the Plan shall be applicable to Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder. 6.7 CONVERSION OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS INTO NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS; TERMINATION OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. The Board of Directors, at the written request of any Participant, may in its discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such Participant's Incentive Stock Options (or any 7
installments or portions of installments thereof) that have not been exercised on the date of conversion into Non-Qualified Options at any time prior to the expiration of such Incentive Stock Options, regardless of whether the Participant is an employee of the Company or a Related Company at the time of such conversion. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, extending the exercise period of the appropriate installments of such Options. At the time of such conversion, the Board of Directors (with the consent of the Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant's Incentive Stock Options converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Board of Directors takes appropriate action. The Board of Directors, with the consent of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any Incentive Stock Option that has not been exercised at the time of such termination. 6.8 SPECIAL RULES FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. An SAR is the right to receive, without payment, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price, multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The grant of SARs under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the express terms of the Plan, as the Board of Directors shall deem desirable: (a) Grant. SARs may be granted in tandem with, in addition to or completely independent of any other Plan Benefit. (b) Grant Price. The grant price of an SAR may be the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant or such other price as the Board of Directors may determine. (c) Exercise. An SAR may be exercised by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Board of Directors or as otherwise provided in any agreement evidencing any SARs. The Board of Directors may provide that an SAR shall be automatically exercised on one or more specified dates. (d) Form of Payment. Payment upon exercise of an SAR may be made in cash, in shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof, as the Board of Directors shall determine. (e) Fair Market Value. Fair market value shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof with reference to the date of grant or the date of exercise of an SAR, as applicable. 6.9 RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option or SAR until the date of issue of a stock certificate to the Participant for such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued. 8
6.10 SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED TO COVERED EMPLOYEES. In order for the full value of Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees to be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, the Company may intend for such Options and SARs to be treated as "qualified performance-based compensation" as described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e) (or any successor regulation). In such case, Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees shall be subject to the following additional requirements: (a) such Options and SARs shall be granted only by the Committee; and (b) the exercise price of such Options and the grant price of such SARs granted shall in no event be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock as of the date of grant of such Options or SARs, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof. SECTION 7 AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK 7.1 GRANTS OF AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. The Board of Directors may grant a Participant an Award or Restricted Stock subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, including, without limitation, restrictions on the pledging, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such shares and the requirement that the Participant forfeit all or a portion of such shares back to the Company upon termination of employment. 7.2 CONDITIONS. Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise at the time of the grant, Awards and Restricted Stock shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) A Participant shall have no rights to an Award or Restricted Stock unless the Participant executes an agreement (an "Agreement") with the Company in a form and including such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. (b) Any stock certificates evidencing shares issued pursuant to an Award or shares of Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company or such other custodian as the Company in its sole discretion may determine until such shares are free of the restrictions set forth herein. Dividends and other property paid in respect of a share issued pursuant to an Award or a share of Restricted Stock may be held by the Company or other custodian until such share is free of restrictions. (c) Certificates for shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, bear a legend to the effect that they are issued subject to specified restrictions. (d) Certificates representing the shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, be registered in the name of the Participant and shall be owned by such Participant. Such Participant shall be the holder of record of such shares for all purposes, including voting and receipt of dividends paid with respect to 9
such shares, except that such dividends may be held in escrow until the underlying share is free of restrictions, as described in paragraph (b) above. (e) If required by the Board of Directors, a Participant receiving an Award or Restricted Stock shall not make, in connection with such Award or Restricted Stock, the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code. 7.3 NONTRANSFERABILITY. An Award and shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, alienated, commuted, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of (except, subject to the provisions of such Participant's Agreement, by will or the laws of descent and distribution), or pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of any obligation, or be otherwise encumbered, and are not subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or other legal or equitable process, prior to the lapse of restrictions on such shares, and any attempt at action in contravention of this Section shall be null and void. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Award or shares of Restricted Stock prior to the lapse of the restrictions imposed on such shares, the Participant's interest in such shares shall terminate. The restrictions with respect to Awards and Restricted Stock may lapse based on the passage of a period of time or the achievement of specified performance goals. In the case of a time-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is over the three years following the date of grant, with one third of the shares of Restricted Stock becoming free of restrictions ratably over a period of no less than three (3) years from the date of grant. In the case of a performance-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is on the first anniversary of the date of grant, upon the achievement of specified performance goals with respect to that one-year period. 7.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR DEATH. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award or Restricted Stock with respect to a Participant's death, disability, retirement or similar occurrences, if, prior to the lapse of restrictions applicable to the Award or Restricted Stock, the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or the Related Companies for any reason, any Awards or shares of Restricted Stock as to which the restrictions have not lapsed shall be forfeited to the Company, effective on the date of the Participant's termination of employment. The Board of Directors may not amend an award of Restricted Stock to provide that the restrictions thereon shall lapse earlier than as provided in Sections 7.3 and 7.4 hereof. SECTION 8 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW 8.1 VIOLATIONS OF LAW. No shares shall be issued and delivered upon exercise of any Option or the payment of any SAR or the making of any Award or award of Restricted Stock unless and until, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, any applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, as applicable, on which stock of the same class is then listed, and any other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall have been fully complied with. Each Participant may, by accepting Plan Benefits, be required to represent and agree in writing, for himself or herself and for his 10
or her transferees by will or the laws of descent and distribution, that the stock acquired by him, her or them is being acquired for investment. The requirement for any such representation may be waived at any time by the Board of Directors. An Option or SAR may not be exercised if, in the determination of the Board of Directors, such exercise would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other applicable law. 8.2 COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 16B-3. The intent of this Plan is to qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent any provision of the Plan does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board of Directors and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board of Directors may exercise discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of the revised exemption or its replacement. SECTION 9 RECAPITALIZATION In the event that dividends are payable in Common Stock of the Company or in the event there are splits, sub-divisions or combinations of shares of Common Stock of the Company, the number of shares available under the Plan and the maximum number of shares with respect to which Plan Benefits may be granted to an employee in a calendar year shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, and the number of shares deliverable upon the exercise thereafter of any Award or Option previously granted shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, without change in the aggregate purchase price, and the number of shares to which granted SARs relate shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, and the grant price of such SARs shall be decreased or increased proportionately, as the case may be. SECTION 10 REORGANIZATION If the Company is merged or consolidated with another entity and the Company is not the surviving corporation in such transaction, or the property or stock of the Company is acquired by any other entity or in the case of a reorganization or liquidation of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder, shall, as to outstanding Plan Benefits, (i) make appropriate provision for the protection of any such outstanding Plan Benefits by the substitution on an equitable basis of appropriate stock of the Company or of the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity which will be issuable in respect of the shares of Common Stock of the Company; provided only that the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the Plan Benefits immediately after such substitution over the purchase or grant price thereof is not more than the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to such Plan Benefits immediately before such substitution over the purchase or grant price thereof, (ii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that all unexercised Plan Benefits must be exercised within a specified number of days of the date of such notice or such Plan Benefits will be terminated, and/or (iii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that the Company or the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity shall have the right, upon the effective date of any such merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or liquidation, to 11
purchase all Plan Benefits held by each Participant and unexercised as of that date at an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value on such date of the shares subject to the Plan Benefits held by such Participant over the aggregate purchase or grant price therefor, such amount to be paid in cash or, if stock of the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity is issuable in respect of the shares of the Common Stock of the Company, then, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, in stock of such merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity equal in fair market value to the aforesaid amount. In any such case the Board of Directors shall, in good faith, determine fair market value and may, in its discretion, advance the lapse of any waiting or installment periods and exercise dates. SECTION 11 NO SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER RIGHTS Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Plan Benefit documentation shall confer upon any Participant receiving a grant of any Plan Benefit any right with respect to the continuation of his or her employment by or other relationship with the Company (or any Related Company) or interfere in any way with the right of the Company (or any Related Company), subject to the terms of any separate employment or other written agreement to the contrary, at any time to terminate such employment or other relationship or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of any Plan Benefit. SECTION 12 AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN The Board of Directors may at any time and from time to time suspend or terminate all or any portion of the Plan or modify or amend the Plan in any respect, provided, however, that the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may not (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock subject to the Plan (except pursuant to Section 9 hereof) or (ii) otherwise amend the Plan in any material respect. The suspension or termination or any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of a Participant, affect the Participant's rights under any Plan Benefit previously granted. With the consent of the affected Participant, the Board of Directors may amend outstanding agreements relating to any Plan Benefit in a manner not inconsistent with the Plan. The Board of Directors, however, may not, without stockholder approval, amend the exercise price of any Option previously awarded pursuant to the Plan by either reducing the exercise price of such Option or canceling such Option and granting a new replacement Option with a lower exercise price. The Board of Directors hereby reserves the right to amend or modify the terms and provisions of the Plan and of any outstanding Options to the extent necessary to qualify any or all Options under the Plan for such favorable federal income tax treatment (including deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code; provided, however, that the consent of a Participant is required if such amendment or modification would cause unfavorable income tax treatment for such Participant. SECTION 13 WITHHOLDING The Company's obligation to deliver shares of stock upon the exercise of any Option or SAR or the granting of any Award or award of Restricted Stock and to make payment upon exercise of any SAR shall be subject to the satisfaction by 12
the Participant of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements. SECTION 14 EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION OF THE PLAN 14.1 EFFECTIVE DATE. The Plan is effective as of May 21, 2003 (the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company). 14.2 DURATION. Unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 12 hereof, the Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the effective date or (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been issued pursuant to any Awards or awards of Restricted Stock and the exercise of Options and SARs granted hereunder. If the date of termination is determined under (i) above, then Plan Benefits outstanding on such date shall continue to have force and effect in accordance with the provisions of the instruments evidencing such Plan Benefits. SECTION 15 GOVERNING LAW The Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 13

EXHIBIT 10.5 ATMI, INC. NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PROGRAM OF ATMI, INC. 2003 STOCK PLAN ARTICLE 1 --------- GENERAL 1.1 NAME AND PURPOSE. ATMI, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, hereby establishes the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the "Program"). The purpose of the Program is to provide Awards under the 2003 Stock Plan of ATMI, Inc. to Non-Employee Directors of the Company as a vehicle to defer receipt of all retainers and meeting fees paid to Non-Employee Directors, and to permit such deferred amounts to be credited to Stock Accounts, established at the time of each deferral, equivalent to shares of the Company's Common Stock, at prices contemporaneous with each deferral date. The Program is intended to meet the requirements of ss.409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and shall be operated and interpreted consistent with that intent. 1.2 DEFINITIONS.

(j) "Separation from Service" means a Separation from Service as defined for purposes of Code ss.409A. Generally, a Non-Employee Director incurs a Separation from Service upon termination of service as a Non-Employee Director of the Company. For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, the Company means the Company and any company that is in the same controlled group with the Company as defined for purposes of Code ss.414(b) and (c), except that for purposes of determining whether another organization is in the same controlled group, common ownership of at least 50% shall be determinative.

ARTICLE 2 --------- FEE DEFERRALS 2.1 ELIGIBILITY. Effective beginning on May 21, 2008, each Non-Employee Director serving on such date or at any time thereafter shall be eligible to participate, and shall participate, in the Program. 2.2 GRANT OF STOCK CREDITS. With respect to all periods beginning on or after May 21, 2008, each Non-Employee Director may elect prior to the beginning of a calendar year to participate in the Program and to defer some or all of the Compensation such Non-Employee Director will earn during such calendar year, in accordance with the terms of this Program. Such deferral elections are irrevocable as of December 31st of the year preceding the year in which the Compensation is earned. With respect to the first year that a Non-Employee Director becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, such Non-Employee Director may elect within 30 days of becoming eligible to participate in this Program, to become a Participant in the Program and defer some or all of the Compensation such Non-Employee Director will earn during the remainder of such calendar year, in accordance with the terms of this Program. Such deferral elections are irrevocable at the end of the 30 day period and shall apply only to Compensation earned after the end of the 30 day period. The determination of whether a Non-Employee Director may elect to defer Compensation under this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Code ss.409A and related Treasury Regulations, including Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(a)(7). Stock Credits with respect to Compensation shall be established on each Deferral Date in an amount equal to the (A) Compensation that would have been paid to a Participant on such Deferral Date but for the Participant's election to defer all or a portion of such Compensation pursuant to the Program, divided by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Deferral Date. 2.3 DIVIDENDS. As of the date any dividend is paid to holders of shares of Common Stock, such Stock Account shall be credited with additional Stock Credits equal to (A) the amount which would have been paid as dividends on that number of shares (including fractions of a share) of Common Stock equal to the number of Stock Credits attributed to such Stock Account on the record date for such dividend payment, divided by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the dividend payment date. In the case of dividends paid in property other than cash, the amount of the dividend shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property at the time of the payment of the dividend, as determined in good faith by the Committee. 3
ARTICLE 3 --------- DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS 3.1 TIME AND METHOD OF PAYMENT. Distribution of the Stock Account of a Participant shall be made to such Participant on the 15th day (or the first Business Day thereafter) of the first calendar month following such Participant's Separation from Service as a director of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as of the Separation from Service date, the Participant is a "specified employee" as defined for purposes of Code ss.409A as a result of prior or current employment with the Company, distribution shall be made as of the first Business Day of the first month following the date that is six months after the Participant's Separation from Service date. In no event may a Participant designate the timing or year of any payment made pursuant to this Section 3.1. Distribution of a Participant's Stock Account shall be made, subject to Section 3.4, in a single installment in that number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of Stock Credits in the Participant's Stock Account on the date of distribution, except that the value of any fractional share shall be paid in cash based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of distribution. 3.2 SEVERE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. Notwithstanding any other Section of this Article 3, at the written request of a Participant or a Participant's legal representative, the Committee, upon a finding that, because of an Unforeseeable Emergency, continued deferral will result in a severe financial hardship to the Participant, shall cancel the deferral election of the Participant for the remainder of the then current year, and may authorize the payment of all or a part of a Participant's Stock Account, subject to Section 3.4, in shares of Common Stock, in a single installment prior to the distribution date for such Stock Account under Section 3.1 or Section 3.3. Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting the cancellation of further deferrals and a distribution under this Section 3.2 shall be determined by the Committee (other than the Participant requesting the distribution) based on the relevant facts and circumstances, but, in any case, a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under this Plan. If a distribution is approved by the Committee, the amount of the payment shall not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the need, taking into account the additional compensation that is available to the Participant as the result of cancellation of deferrals to the Plan, including amounts necessary to pay any taxes or penalties that the Participant reasonably anticipates will result from the payment. Distributions under this Section 3.2 shall be paid in a single lump sum within the 90-day period following the date the payment is approved by the Committee. In no event shall the Participant have a right to designate the taxable year of the payment. 4
3.3 DISTRIBUTION UPON DEATH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Program, upon the death of a Participant, the Committee shall authorize the Company to distribute, subject to Section 3.4 hereof, all of such Participant's Stock Account to such person or persons as the Participant may have designated. All such designations shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Committee and delivered to the Committee. A Participant may from time to time revoke or change any such designation by written notice to the Committee. If there is no designation on file with the Committee at the time of the Participant's death, or if the person or persons designated therein shall not be living or otherwise have ceased to exist as of the payment date, the distribution shall be made to the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.3, the distribution shall be made in accordance with Section 3.1, above. 3.4 WITHHOLDING TAXES. If required by any applicable law, the Company shall deduct from all distributions under the Plan any taxes required to be withheld by federal, state, or local governments, computed on the basis of the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise distributable on the date of distribution. 3.5 ADJUSTMENT OF STOCK ACCOUNTS. If at any time the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be increased as the result of any stock dividend, stock split, subdivision or reclassification of shares, the number of Stock Credits with which the Stock Account of each Participant is credited shall be increased in the same proportion as the outstanding number of shares of Common Stock is increased. If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall at any time be decreased as the result of any combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares, the number of Stock Credits with which the Stock Account of each Participant is credited shall be decreased in the same proportion as the outstanding number of shares of Common Stock is decreased. In the event a dividend in kind is declared having a value per share of Common Stock equal to 10% or more of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Business Day prior to the public announcement of such dividend, the Committee shall make an appropriate equitable adjustment in the number of Stock Credits with which the Stock Account of each Participant is credited. In the event the Company shall at any time be consolidated with or merged into any other corporation and holders of shares of Common Stock receive shares of the capital stock of the resulting or surviving corporation (or any consideration other than shares of capital stock), there shall be credited to the Stock Account of each Participant, in place of the Stock Credits then credited thereto, new Stock Credits in an amount equal to the product of the number of shares of capital stock (or consideration other than shares of capital stock) exchanged for one share of Common Stock upon such consolidation or merger and the number of Stock Credits with which such Stock Account then is credited. 5
ARTICLE 4 --------- THE COMMITTEE 4.1 AUTHORITY. The Committee shall have full power and authority to administer the Program, including the power to (a) promulgate forms to be used with respect to the Program, (b) promulgate rules of Program administration, (c) settle any disputes as to rights or benefits arising from the Program, (d) interpret and construe the terms of the Program, including, but not limited to, determining entitlement to benefits and the amount of such benefits, and (e) make such decisions or take such action as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to aid in the proper administration of the Program. Any decision made by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company, Participants and their heirs or successors. The Committee may delegate its power and authority to administer the Program to officers and employees of the Company; provided, however, that the Committee's power and authority under Section 3.2 (regarding Severe Financial Hardship) shall not be delegated. 4.2 OPERATION. The Committee may act (a) by majority vote of its members meeting in person or by telephone, or (b) by consent in writing signed by all of the members of the Committee. 4.3 ELECTIONS, NOTICES. All elections and notices required to be provided to the Committee under the Program must be in such form or forms prescribed by, and contain such information as is required by, the Committee. ARTICLE 5 --------- MISCELLANEOUS 5.1 FUNDING. All amounts payable under the Program shall constitute a general unsecured obligation of the Company. 5.2 NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS. No benefit under the Program shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void. No such benefit, prior to receipt thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Program, shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the Participant. 6
5.3 GOVERNING LAW. This Program shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut. 5.4 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION OF THE PROGRAM. The Board at any time may amend or modify the Program in any respect; provided, however, that (A) no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary, including his or her rights with respect to Stock Credits credited prior to such amendment or modification, without his or her consent; and (b) no such amendment or modification shall permit the acceleration or delay of a distribution hereunder except as permitted under Code ss.409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may terminate the Program and pay Participants (or their beneficiaries) their accrued benefits in a single lump sum at any time, to the extent and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix). 5.5 NON-FORFEITURABILITY OF STOCK CREDITS. No Stock Credits credited to the Stock Account of a Participant shall be forfeitable for any reason. 5.6 SUCCESSORS AND HEIRS. The Program and any properly executed elections hereunder shall be binding upon the Company and Participants, and upon any assignee or successor in interest to the Company and upon the heirs, legal representatives and beneficiaries of any Participant. 5.7 STATUS OF PARTICIPANTS. Stock Credits are not, and do not constitute, shares of Common Stock. No right as a holder of shares of Common Stock shall devolve upon a Participant by reason of his or her participation in the Program until such time as shares of Common Stock are distributed in accordance with Article 3. 5.8 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. After the end of each calendar quarter, each Participant in the Program during the immediately preceding calendar quarter shall receive a statement of his or her Stock Account under the Program as of the end of such preceding calendar quarter. Such statement shall be in a form and contain such information as is deemed appropriate by the Committee. 5.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. Each Participant shall agree to be bound by the terms of the Program as set forth herein. This document contains the entire agreement of the Participant and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof. No modification or claim of waiver of any of the provisions hereof shall be valid unless in writing 7
signed by the party against whom such modification or waiver is sought to be enforced. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned officer, acting on behalf of the Company, has set his/her hand as of this ___ day of ___________, 2008. ATMI, Inc. By:___________________________________ Its 8

On April 14, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of ATMI, Inc. (the Company) approved and authorized amendments to the Company's Employment Agreements with Eugene G. Banucci, Douglas A. Neugold, Daniel P. Sharkey, Timothy C. Carlson and Ellen T. Harmon to conform them with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and, with respect to all Employment Agreements other than Dr. Banucci's, to clarify the level of accelerated vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards upon a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Employment Agreements, as amended). The amendments primarily clarify (i) the timing of severance payments and other benefits in the event that the executive experiences an involuntary separation from service, (ii) the circumstances under which an executive may be entitled to severance benefits in the event of a termination by the executive for good reason (as defined in the Employment Agreements, as amended), and (iii) with respect to all Employment Agreements other than Dr. Banucci's, the accelerated vesting of performance-based restricted stock within the first year after grant and as to which the amount earned has not yet been determined in the event of a change in control (as defined in the Employment Agreements, as amended) at the target level.

Dear Gene,
 
You and ATMI, Inc. agree that it is in our mutual best interest to amend your Employment Agreement with the Company dated September 19, 2005 as follows:
 
 
2.3       You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(b) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;
 
(d) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option or restricted stock agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested);
 
 
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice. In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
 
2.5       Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute a Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), or in the event of your death or your Disability (as defined for purposes of Code 409A), the Company shall pay to you or your estate (as the case may be) an amount equal to the amount of Base Salary (as of the date of your Separation from Service, death or Disability) that would have been paid to you had you completed the Term of this Agreement. Payment of this separation pay benefit shall be made in a single lump sum within 60 days after your Separation from Service, death or Disability, provided that in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment, and in no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer the payment to a later date.
 
In addition, if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, until the earlier of the time you are no longer eligible for COBRA coverage or June 5, 2008, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company.
 
 
2.6       Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to amounts specified in Section 2.5, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) (termination by the Company without Cause) or Section 2.3 (termination by you for Good Reason) under circumstances that constitute a Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and within 548 days after a change in control of the Company:
 
(a) (i) unless the Board determines otherwise pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 10 of the ATMI, Inc,. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) (relating to the Boards discretion to cash out or require the exercise of all vested and unvested options in connection with the change in control) or a comparable provision of any other plan, which in no event may cause the forfeiture of unvested options, all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the
 
 
 
Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and (ii) all restricted stock issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted, such shares shall not vest. In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted.
 
Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will reimburse you for any such excise tax imposed on a fully grossed up basis, such that you will receive the same net amount (after payment of all income, employment and excise taxes imposed with respect to such benefits and such tax reimbursements, and of any interest or penalties relating to any such excise taxes or to the income tax due on any such tax reimbursements (other than interest or penalties arising as a result of your failure to timely pay such excise or income taxes with respect to which you had previously received reimbursement)) as you would have received if such excise tax had not been imposed in the first place. Such reimbursement payment shall be made, if at all, by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you remit the relevant taxes to the applicable tax authorities and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.6, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if: (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes
 
 
 
 
that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a 
Transaction
), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving: individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.

2.3       You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c)), including, without limitation, any failure by the Boards of Directors of the Company or ATMI Sub to re-elect you to your position as President and Chief Executive Officer;
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;

provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice. In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
 
2.5       Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8 in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute a Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to two times your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 24 equal monthly installments.

(b) In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in 18 equal monthly installments commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
(c) In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company.

(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.

Dear Ellen,
 
You and ATMI, Inc. agree that it is in our mutual best interest to amend your Employment Agreement with the Company dated January 14, 2008 as follows:
 
 
2.3       You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c)), including, without limitation, any failure by the Boards of Directors of the Company or ATMI Sub to elect or re-elect you to your positions as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and/or Secretary thereof;
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below, or your 45% of Base Salary target incentive compensation opportunity;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;
 
(d) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or
 
 
 
 
 
(e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option or restricted stock agreement to which you are a party, unless the awards covered thereby have fully vested);
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice. In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
 
2.6       Subject to Section 2.9 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.5 in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute a Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 12 equal monthly installments.
 
(a) Payment of your separation pay benefit shall commence as of the 30th day after your Separation from Service, and shall continue in monthly installments thereafter until all 12 payments are made.
 
(b) In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in 6 equal monthly installments commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
(c) In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, (1) if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company; and (2) for a one-year period from your Separation from Service Date, the Company will provide you with disability insurance benefits on the same basis the Company would have provided you such benefits had you continued to be an employee of the Company during such period.

(a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of ATMI Commpn Stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, provided that such acceleration of vesting shall not occur if and to the extent that (i) ATMIs independent accountant has advised the Board of Directors of ATMI that such acceleration could prohibit the accounting treatment of the transaction which is a change in control as a pooling of interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 (or any successor opinion) and (ii) the Board of Directors of ATMI intends to treat such transaction as a pooling of interests, in which case options would continue to vest as permitted within the terms of the applicable stock plans and stock option award agreements;
 
(b) all restricted stock issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock, provided, however, that any restricted stock that is within its first year of grant and remains subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest only at the target level provided in the grant; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted, such shares shall not vest. In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares are granted.
 
 
 
 
Benefits payable under this Section 2.7 or Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will reimburse you for any such excise tax imposed on a fully grossed up basis, such that you will receive the same net amount (after payment of all income, employment and excise taxes imposed with respect to such benefits and such tax reimbursements, and of any interest or penalties relating to any such excise taxes or to the income tax due on any such tax reimbursements (other than interest or penalties arising as a result of your failure to timely pay such excise or income taxes with respect to which you had previously received reimbursement)) as you would have received if such excise tax had not been imposed in the first place. It is expressly understood that in calculating the amount of the reimbursement, additional taxes incurred as a result of the reimbursement shall be included in the total reimbursed hereunder. Such reimbursement payment shall be made, if at all, by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you remit the relevant taxes to the applicable tax authorities. Any and all payments made pursuant to this excise tax gross-up provision shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.7, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.7, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if: (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a 
Transaction
), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving: individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
ATMI REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2008 FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
 
DANBURY, CT  April 23, 2008
 ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced that revenues increased 13% to $92.8 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $82.2 million in the first quarter of 2007. Net income increased 64% to $10.4 million, compared with $6.3 million a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were $0.32, compared with $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007.
Operating income increased 103% to $15.2 million, compared with $7.5 million a year ago, while operating margin for the first quarter increased to 16.3%, compared with 9.1% for the first quarter a year earlier. This improvement was expected given some of the operating difficulties experienced in the first quarter of last year.
Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, Revenue for the first quarter was in line with our plan. While there is uncertainty in our primary market of integrated circuit (IC) producers, we continue to expect wafer start and device unit growth for the IC industry in 2008, and continued growth for ATMI. This outlook reflects our strategy to find node and non-node IC growth opportunities, as well as growth from new market applications. Our strategic investment in High Productivity Development has fueled significant new

customer collaborations, and the acquisition of LevTechnow part of our LifeSciences businessgives us major market share in the rapidly growing one-time use mixing segment of bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer, said, Given the industry environment, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, particularly with the operating leverage at both the gross and operating margin lines.
We completed our $225 million share repurchase program in early March, buying an additional 2.1 million shares during the quarter for about $58 million. The share repurchases, combined with the LevTech acquisition and High Productivity Development capital spending, reduced our cash balance by about $86 million. Despite the current macroeconomic uncertainties, we are maintaining our 2008 guidance and expect revenues to be in the $400 to $420 million range, and earnings per diluted share in the $1.32 to $1.48 range.
 
A conference call (888.822.9375) to discuss the companys first quarter financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, April 23, 2008.

Item 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 14, 2008, ATMI, Inc. issued a press release announcing certain preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
On July 14, 2008, ATMI, Inc. issued a press release announcing the global settlement of litigation with Praxair, Inc. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(d) 
Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
           ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced second quarter revenues will be approximately $89 million, a decline of 3% compared with the second quarter of 2007, with diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.30, an increase of 15% over the second quarter of last year. The expected results are below consensus for the quarter.
DANBURY, CT  July 14, 2008
          The Company now anticipates full year revenues between $375 and $400 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.40, compared to its prior guidance of revenues between $400-$420 million and diluted EPS between $1.32-$1.48.
          "The second quarter revenue shortfall reflects a delay in the shipment of some SDS products, reduced sales into the memory sector, and slower-than-anticipated new product adoption," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer.
     "A significant SDS product shipment to China at the end of June was delayed because of customs and security procedures associated with the upcoming Olympic Games. Management expects this shipment to be completed in the third quarter. Reduced growth in certain segments of the memory sector slowed product shipments. While we continue to make qualification progress at all important accounts around the world, the unique annuity-oriented business model we have for RegenSi and AutoClean solutions has slowed the revenue ramp of these products in the short term; sales of ATMI Lifesciences products to the biopharmaceutical market were ahead of plan."
     "During the second quarter we began to benefit from a lower overall tax liability from
 
ATMI Second Quarter 2008 Update  Page 2 of 2
foreign R&D tax credits, along with continued operational efficiency improvements. During the second half, we will benefit from reduced litigation spending because of our settlement with Praxair," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer.
     ATMI intends to release second quarter 2008 financial results before the Market opens on July 23, 2008. ATMI will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern the same day to review and discuss the results, at 888.822.9375. Interested parties may also listen to the conference call via audio streaming on the Internet at ATMI.com. A replay of the call will be available by phone for 48 hours at 800.642.1687 (access code 30943609) and on the web for one month at ATMI.com.

Exhibit 99.1
 ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced revenues of $89.5 million for the second quarter of 2008, a 3% decline compared with $92.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted share were $0.30, a 15% increase compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007.
DANBURY, Conn.  July 23, 2008
ATMI announced on July 14 that second quarter revenue would be below expectations due to shipment delays for some SDS products, reduced sales into the memory sector, and slower-than-anticipated new product adoption.
th
Operating income increased 15% to $13.4 million, compared with $11.6 million a year ago, while operating margin for the second quarter increased to 14.9%, compared with 12.6% for the second quarter a year earlier.
For the six months ended June 30, 2008 revenues increased 4% to $182.3 million, compared with $174.6 million in the first half of 2007. Earnings per diluted share were $0.62 in the first six months of 2008, a 41% increase compared with $0.44 per diluted share in the first half of 2007.
 
ATMI Reports Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results  Page 2 of 5
Operating income increased 49% to $28.5 million in the first half of 2008, compared with $19.1 million a year ago, while operating margin for the first half increased to 15.7%, compared with 11.0% in the first half of 2007. This improvement was expected given some of the operating difficulties experienced in the first half of last year.
Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "We understand what caused our shortfall in revenue in the second quarter, and are responding accordingly.. While the broad adoption of the new AutoClean and RegenSi products is taking longer than expected, we remain confident about their ultimate prospects for success. ."
Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Despite our disappointing revenue performance in the quarter, we improved our profitability. Gross margin improved to 51.7% in the second quarter from 48.9% a year ago, because of favorable product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and supply chain cost-saving initiatives. Going forward, we will benefit from reduced litigation spending now that the matters with Praxair have been settled. However, given the current economic environment, we remain cautious about the outlook for the rest of the year."
A conference call (888.822.9375) to discuss the Company's second quarter financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, July 23, 2008. A replay (800.642.1687, passcode 30943609) of the call will be available for 48 hours. An audio webcast of the conference call will be available for 30 days on atmi.com.

The information contained in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

(NASDAQ: ATMI) today announced that financial results for 2008 are expected to be below the Company's previously disclosed full year guidance for both revenue and diluted earnings per share of $375-$400 million and $1.25-$1.40.
DANBURY, CT  September 26, 2008  ATMI, Inc.
Since ATMI last updated its 2008 guidance on July 14, 2008, market conditions have significantly deteriorated. The Company's reduced revenue outlook is the result of a marked slowdown in demand across all of ATMI's semiconductor and flat panel display end markets, a trend that accelerated in the past month. The reductions in wafer starts in the foundry and memory segments are expected to have an adverse effect on the Company's near term results. Furthermore, the adoption of certain new products introduced during the year has been slower than expected, and is not expected to offset the effect of reduced wafer starts. In management's view, these market conditions are likely to continue until semiconductor manufacturer and consumer product demand recover.
As a result, third quarter revenue is now expected to be in the $85.0-$90.0 million range and diluted earnings per share in the $0.18-$0.23 range. Excluded from this third quarter earnings per share estimate is an expected favorable one-time tax benefit of approximately $4.0 million (equivalent to approximately $0.13 per diluted share), as discussed in the Company's previous Form 10Q filing. The Company will review its fourth quarter outlook in conjunction with its third quarter earnings conference call on October 22, 2008.
 
ATMI Reduces 2008 Guidance  Page 2 of 3
Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are experiencing significant changes in the markets we serve that will create the most challenging wafer start environment we have seen since 2001, and we are taking appropriate action."
Neugold continued, "This environment should also magnify the opportunity to help our customers improve their process efficiency as well as meet ongoing technology node requirements in more effective ways, areas where we are already strong. Our focus on customer-driven process efficiency requirements, high productivity research and development, and strategic customer relationships  combined with our ongoing profitability and strong balance sheet  provide ample opportunity to improve our market position and sets the stage for future growth as the industry recovers."
ATMI intends to release third quarter 2008 financial results before the Market opens on October 22, 2008. ATMI will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern the same day to review and discuss the results, at 888.822.9375. Interested parties may also listen to the conference call via audio streaming on the Internet at ATMI.com.

DANBURY, Conn.  October 22, 2008
ATMI announced on September 26 that third quarter and 2008 revenue and earnings would be below expectations primarily because of a marked slowdown in demand across all of ATMI's semiconductor and flat panel display end markets.
th
Operating income for the third quarter of 2008 was $10.0 million, compared with $15.1 million a year ago, while operating margin was 11.5%, compared with 16.6% for the third quarter a year earlier.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008 revenues increased 1.2% to $269.0 million, compared with $265.7 million in the same period of 2007. Earnings per diluted share were $0.93 in the first nine months of 2008, including the $0.10 net diluted earnings per share benefit recognized this quarter, compared with $0.76 per diluted share in the same period of 2007.
 
ATMI Reports Third Quarter 2008 Financial Results  Page 2 of 5
Operating income increased 12.2% to $38.5 million in the first nine months of 2008, compared with $34.3 million a year ago, while operating margin for the first nine months increased to 14.3%, compared with 12.9% in the first nine months of 2007.
Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "With so much in flux today, we can't accurately gauge how the economic environment will affect our customers and therefore our business in the near term, but signs point to continuing weakness through the fourth quarter and into 2009."
Neugold continued, "While we have no control over end markets, we are planning for tough market conditions, and are focusing our time and attention on operating efficiency, cost reduction, new product development, and cash generation."
A conference call (888.822.9375) to discuss the Company's third quarter financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, October 22, 2008.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority.

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at any meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by written proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.

As further set forth in this paragraph, the corporation (i) shall indemnify any director, officer, or other authorized representative who is not a director or an officer but is otherwise serving at the request of the corporation, and (ii) may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify any authorized representative not identified in clause (i) above. Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any third party proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing, such third party proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any third party proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the authorized representative did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.
Indemnification of Authorized Representatives in Third Party Proceedings

Such indemnification applies to an authorized representative who was or is a party to or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), or is threatened to be made a party to or involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any corporate proceeding by reason of the fact that such person was or is a director, an officer, an authorized representative other than a director or an officer serving at the request of the corporation, or any other authorized representative, as the case may be, of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal) such corporate proceeding, or preparing for any of the foregoing, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; , that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation except and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such corporate proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.

Such expenses shall be so paid upon such other reasonable terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. The financial ability of any authorized representative to make a repayment contemplated by this section shall not be a prerequisite to the making of an advance.
Advancing Expenses
8.7 The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an authorized representative against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.

Reliance on Provisions
8.10 . If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability
8.11 . In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the authorized representative, who, at the request of the corporation and at its sole cost and expense, shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

Exhibit 14.1
 
 
Dear Fellow ATMI Employees:
Integrity is at the heart of our ACT IT values and A-player culture, and it is the standard for the way in which we are expected to treat each other and to do business around the world. In today's competitive market, our reputation for integrity is a prized asset and one of the keys to our success.
Our commitment to integrity is reflected in the ATMI Business Code of Conduct, which states the principles that guide our behavior. Many of these principles are based upon fundamental legal requirements of the countries in which we do business. To meet the standard of integrity that we have set for ourselves, and to promote compliance with applicable laws, it is critical that all of us are familiar with and understand the provisions of our Code of Conduct.
Every employee of ATMI, including its officers, and each member of ATMI's Board of Directors, has the responsibility to comply with the principles of ATMI's Business Code of Conduct and all of the policies and procedures that have been established by the Company. I, along with the other senior managers of the Company, am committed to maintaining a culture that rewards compliance and encourages employees to raise compliance concerns to the highest level of the Company without fear of retaliation.
All new employees are asked to read and make a commitment, and all employees will be asked periodically to read and refresh their commitment, to follow the principles of ATMI's Business Code of Conduct and the Company's policies and procedures. Please read this Code carefully and use it as a guide that forms the basis of your interactions with fellow employees, customers, suppliers, other business partners, and the communities in which we operate.
 
ATMI (sometimes referred to as the "Company") has issued it's the ATMI Business Code of Conduct (sometimes referred to as "Code of Conduct" or "Code") to provide a single set of principles to help employees around the world take a consistent approach to key integrity issues. This Code contains basic information about these principles, and the responsibilities of all employees to comply, penalties for failures to comply, and how to handle an integrity concern.
What is the ATMI Business Code of Conduct?
The ATMI Business Code of Conduct states the principles that ATMI has adopted regarding key integrity issues. This is ATMI employees' guide to help identify risk areas that you may encounter in your job and to learn what to do whenever you have a question or concern.
How is the ATMI Business Code of Conduct organized?
This introduction explains the responsibilities that all employees have for complying with ATMI's Business Code of Conduct, policies and procedures, and for raising concerns about possible violations of any provision of this Code, Company policy or procedure, or applicable law. Each section of this Code has a summary of principles, the key requirements, and examples of what to watch for or "red flags." Make sure you understand each principle as it relates to your job. If necessary, talk to your manager to understand how the principles apply to your job, and for additional information about the Company policies and procedures that apply to you and your job function.
Who must follow this Code and Company policies and procedures?
ATMI's Code, policies and procedures apply to all employees, including officers, of ATMI, Inc. and its subsidiaries worldwide. The ATMI Business Code of Conduct also applies to the Directors of ATMI, Inc. Any exceptions to the ATMI Business Code of Conduct must be specifically approved by the Company's Chief Legal Officer ("CLO"). Any exceptions for Directors or Executive Officers must be specifically approved by the Board of Directors of ATMI.
The ATMI Business Code of Conduct also satisfies the Company's obligation to adopt a code of ethics that applies to certain officers of ATMI, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, under Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Which law applies?
ATMI operates in various countries around the world, with employees who are citizens of many different countries. Such operations are subject to the laws of the countries, provinces, states, and municipalities where they take place. In addition, the laws of some countries may apply to ATMI operations that take place outside of the country. An important challenge for all of us is to understand how these laws may apply to our activities and job functions.
The reality for a global company like ATMI is that there may be instances of actual or apparent conflict between the applicable laws of two or more countries. When you encounter such a conflict, you must consult with the Company's CLO to determine how to resolve that conflict properly.
 
What are an employee's responsibilities?
Each of the principles included in this Code identifies specific responsibilities. In addition to the responsibilities specifically stated in this Code, you also have the following basic obligations:
It is the Company's policy to cooperate with all government investigations and inquiries. All subpoenas, legal complaints, information document or record requests, or other inquiries should be referred to the CLO.
What are the penalties for violations of the ATMI Business Code of Conduct or Company policies and procedures?
Employees who violate, request others to violate, knowingly encourage or ignore a violation of, or retaliate against another employee for reporting a potential violation of, this Code or any Company policy or procedure are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. In determining the appropriate sanction in any particular case, the Company may consider, among other things, the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was a single or repeated occurrence, whether the violation appears to have been intentional or inadvertent, and whether the individuals involved had been advised prior to the violation as to the proper course of action (including through this Code or the Company's policies and procedures). In addition, if the violation of the Code, policy or procedure is also a violation of law, you and/or the Company may be subject to criminal penalties (fines or jail sentences) or civil sanctions (damage awards or fines).
 
Employee Certification
A certification of compliance with ATMI's Business Code of Conduct and Company policies and procedures must be signed by all newly-hired employees upon joining ATMI, and by all employees on an annual basis. Refusal by any employee to sign the certification will subject such employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
 
 
No matter how great the business pressures, ATMI will do business only by lawful and ethical means. When working with customers and suppliers in every aspect of our business, we will not compromise our commitment to integrity.
OVERVIEW
Employees should not offer anything of value to obtain any improper advantage in selling goods and services, conducting financial transactions, or representing ATMI's interests to any governmental authorities, including, without limitation, as prohibited under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This policy sets forth ATMI's standards of conduct and practices for certain kinds of payments, entertainment, and political contributions. ATMI must not authorize, involve itself in, or tolerate any business practice that does not follow this policy.
In addition to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, a violation of this policy can also result in severe civil and criminal penalties. All countries prohibit the bribery of their own public officials and many also prohibit the bribery of officials of other countries. This policy goes beyond these laws and prohibits improper payments in all of our activities, both with governments and in the private sector.

OVERVIEW
Many countries regulate international trade transactions, such as imports, exports, and international financial transactions, for a variety of reasons, including national security and foreign policy. In addition, the United States prohibits any cooperation with boycotts against countries friendly to the United States or against firms that may be "blacklisted" by certain groups or countries.
In April 2004, the United Nations Security Council called upon all member states to establish national export control systems, including restrictions on support and financing, to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. Consequently, it is likely that the number of countries with national export control systems will grow significantly. ATMI recognizes that the complexity of export controls and the growing number of different national export control systems can make compliance extremely difficult. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the CLO.

ATMI's relationships with suppliers must be based on lawful practices. We also expect our suppliers to adhere to applicable legal requirements in their business relationships, including those with their employees, their local communities, and ATMI. The quality of our supplier relationships often has a direct bearing on the quality of our customer relationships. Likewise, the quality of our suppliers' products and services affects the quality of our own products and services.

The competition laws, also sometimes know as "antitrust" laws, are a critical part of the global business environment in which ATMI operates. The laws' primary purpose is to prevent interference with the functioning of a competitive market system. They govern a wide range of business activities, including, without limitation, setting prices, and purchasing, selling and marketing goods and services. Every employee is responsible for complying with the competition laws.
OVERVIEW
ATMI is dedicated to compliance with the competition laws in all of its activities. Competition law issues may be very complex. As such issues arise, you should review this policy and discuss any issues with the Company's CLO.

All of us also have important responsibilities to each other and to the communities in which we work. Throughout ATMI, we must ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit and that working conditions comply with the law. We must also strive to provide safe environments for our employees and the communities in which we do business.
OVERVIEW
All employees have a responsibility to ensure environmental, health, and safety (sometimes referred to as "EH&S") excellence. ATMI will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business. ATMI has a comprehensive EH&S management system that is covered as part of each employee's orientation, as applicable. ATMI handles and processes many different and potentially hazardous materials with numerous laws and regulations, and Company policies and procedures that apply to various activities, products, and services. ATMI must secure all hazardous materials at all times. Unauthorized persons are not to have access to hazardous materials and hazardous materials are not to be received, shipped, or disposed of without following the applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures.
All employees are responsible to question and verify that ATMI is complying with applicable requirements relating to their respective jobs.

ATMI is committed to fair employment practices, including the prohibition of all forms of illegal discrimination, and to following applicable labor and employment laws wherever it operates. This includes observing those laws that pertain to freedom of association, privacy, recognition of the right to engage in collective bargaining, the prohibition of forced compulsory and child labor, and those laws that pertain to the elimination of any improper employment discrimination. By providing equal access and fair treatment to all employees, we improve the Company's success while enhancing the progress of individuals and the communities where we operate.

All ATMI employees have a direct role in helping to maintain the Company's financial integrity by keeping Company records accurate. We must also safeguard Company property, whether it is a piece of equipment, an electronic file, a Company trademark, or confidential information about a product or an upcoming transaction. In addition, we have a fundamental obligation to make sound business decisions on behalf of our Company that are not influenced by our individual family, financial, or other interests.
OVERVIEW
The Company recognizes that employees may take part in legitimate financial, business, and other activities outside their jobs. However, those activities must be lawful and free from conflicts with their responsibilities as ATMI employees, that is, they cannot interfere (or be reasonably thought to interfere) with the independent exercise of judgment on behalf of ATMI and in its best interests. Employees must not misuse ATMI resources or influence, or discredit ATMI's good name and reputation.
The effectiveness of this policy depends in large part upon all employees' cooperation in disclosing any situation that may be contrary to the intent of the policy and the ethical standards that it expresses.
You have an affirmative duty to seek guidance from your manager or the Company's CLO before engaging in any activity that may be of a controversial or sensitive nature.

OVERVIEW
In addition to employees' responsibility to avoid conflicts of interest, employees owe a duty to ATMI to advance the Company's legitimate business interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Business opportunities that arise through the use of ATMI's assets, property, or information, or by virtue of your position at ATMI, belong to ATMI. ATMI employees may not take for themselves, or direct to any family member, friend, or other person or entity, opportunities that are discovered through the use of ATMI's assets, property, or information, or by virtue of their position at the Company, nor may employees use ATMI's assets, property, or information, or their position at the Company, for personal gain.

Controllership is comprised of three elements that are critical to ATMI's commitment to maximize shareholder value: (1) compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies; (2) rigorous business processes designed to ensure that management decisions are based on sound economic analysis (including a prudent consideration of risks), and that the Company's physical, financial, and intellectual property assets are safeguarded and optimally employed; and (3) integrity in communications, to ensure accurate, full, fair, timely, and understandable disclosure in all of the Company's public communications, including the reporting of financial information.

OVERVIEW
ATMI is committed to fair and open markets for publicly-traded securities. We have established standards of conduct for employees and others who obtain material or price-sensitive non-public ("inside") information through their work for the Company. ATMI's directors and officers are also subject to additional responsibilities with respect to trading in ATMI stock, such as a prohibition on trading during quarterly "blackout" periods. Insider trading and stock tipping are criminal offenses in most countries where the Company does business. Our policy requires not only full compliance with applicable laws, but also avoiding the appearance of insider trading or stock tipping. This policy is not meant to restrict the freedom of employees to make appropriate personal investments or the Company's right to legitimately use and disclose inside information in the ordinary conduct of its business.
Insider trading means personally buying or selling stock or other securities of any company while in possession of material non-public information about that company. Stock tipping means disclosing inside information about a company  for example, to a relative, colleague, or friend  that enables a person to buy or sell stock or other securities of a company on the basis of such information. Information is "material" if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider such information important in arriving at a decision to buy, sell, or hold securities, including, without limitation, earnings estimates or financial results of a company before public release, a significant expansion or curtailment of operations, a significant increase or decline in business, a significant merger or acquisition proposal or agreement, the purchase or sale of substantial assets, a substantial new contract or loss of contract, a major litigation or investigation, and any extraordinary management developments. This list is not exhaustive. Other types of information may be material at any particular time, depending upon the circumstances. If you have any doubt as to whether certain information is or is not material, contact the CFOCLO or the CFO.

Restriction on Trading in ATMI Securities by Directors and Officers
ATMI has implemented the following additional requirements applicable to (i) all directors of ATMI, and their Affiliates (which is defined to include spouses, minor children, other relatives living in their homes, trusts or other accounts in which they or relatives living in their homes have a beneficial interest, and trusts or other accounts over which they exercise control or investment influence), and (ii) all officers of ATMI subject to Section 16 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and their Affiliates (as defined above):
. Purchases, sales, gifts, or other transfers of ATMI securities may not be made during the period beginning on the sixteenth day of the third calendar month of any fiscal quarter (i.e., March 16, June 16, September 16 and December 16) and ending at the close of business on the second trading day after the release of that fiscal quarter's financial results (the ""); and
Blackout Period
Blackout Period
. Prior to initiating any transaction in ATMI securities outside of the Blackout Period, a director or officer must first notify ATMI's CFO or, if he or she is not available, the CLO or Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), in writing of the desire to so transact. The CFO, CLO, or CEO will determine whether or not the proposed transaction may be undertaken and will promptly advise the director or officer of the decision (""). Such preclearance to transact may not be sought if the director or officer is then in possession of "inside" information. If clearance to buy, sell, gift, or otherwise transfer the stock is given, the transaction should be completed by the end of the second trading day thereafter, or new clearance must be obtained. If the CFO, CLO, or CEO determines that the transaction should not be made because of circumstances at ATMI (which circumstances need not be revealed to the requester), the decision shall be final and be adhered to by the director or officer. This determination remains in effect until subsequent clearance is received. If you have been denied clearance to transact, you should not disclose this to others.
Preclearance
Preclearance
Restriction on Trading in ATMI Securities by Other Designated Senior Employees
Certain other employees, because of their access to certain "inside" information on a regular basis, may also be required to comply with the Blackout Period and Preclearance provisions. This requirement will also apply to Affiliates (as defined above) of such designated employees. The employees in this category will change from time to time. If you are in this category, you will be notified individually.
OVERVIEW
Among our most valuable assets is our intellectual property  patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, and other proprietary information. It is ATMI's policy to establish, protect, maintain, and defend its rights with respect to its intellectual property and to use those rights in responsible ways. All employees must take steps to safeguard these assets.
In addition to protecting the Company's intellectual property rights, the Company respects the valid intellectual property rights of others. Unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of others may expose the Company to civil law suits and damages. In many countries, theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other intellectual property may result in significant fines and criminal penalties to both the Company and to the individual. ATMI's products, services, and processes, and any proposed use of the intellectual property of others, should be timely and reasonably reviewed for infringement by intellectual property counsel in the Company's Legal organization.
 
 
ATMI employees who create records and data must always use care to make them accurate, complete, and not misleading.
Employees are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and Company policies and procedures relating to the management, preservation and disposal of records. Records include all hard-copy and electronically-stored information that is created or received by ATMI in the course of its business. Records include, but are not limited to, documents, papers, handwritten notes, faxes, photographs, drawings, emails, Word documents, spreadsheets, Power Point presentations, and electronic databases.
Special requirements regarding the retention of Company records may apply if there is pending or threatened litigation, regulatory proceeding or investigation, or if ATMI has received a subpoena or other request pursuant to law to produce records. In these circumstances, you will receive a notification from the Legal organization that certain records are subject to a "legal hold." If a legal hold applies, you are required to preserve all relevant records and to suspend any regular or other destruction processes or procedures that would otherwise apply to such records until you receive notification from the Legal organization that the legal hold no longer applies. Employees must notify the Company's CLO if they become aware that records subject to a legal hold have been altered or destroyed while the legal hold is in effect.
 
ATMI has a cross-functional Compliance Committee, comprised of representatives of Finance (including Internal Audit), Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, International Trade Control, EH&S, and other functional, business or geographic organizations designated from time to time by the Executive Team or the Compliance Committee. A list of the current members of the Compliance Committee is posted on the Company's internal website, or may be obtained from ATMI's Legal organization.
The purpose of the Compliance Committee is to support (i) the conduct of business globally by ATMI in a manner that is legal, ethical and consistent with the ATMI Business Code of Conduct; (ii) ATMI's compliance activities worldwide; and (iii) the collection and reporting of information about these matters. The Compliance Committee Charter is posted on the Company's internal website, or may be obtained from ATMI's Legal organization.
The Compliance Committee is chaired by the Company's CLO, who is also the Company's Chief Compliance Officer. As Chief Compliance Officer, the CLO has overall responsibility for the Company's ethics and compliance program.
Any employee with a question or concern about an ethics or compliance matter, may consult the CLO or any member of the Compliance Committee. An employee who wants to report a possible violation of law, or of Company policy or procedure, may report that matter to the CLO or any member of the Compliance Committee. This is in addition to the ability of employees to raise concerns or make reports with their managers, any attorney in the Company's Legal organization, or the Director of Internal Audit, or by using the Company's Ethics and Compliance Hotline (see "Ethics and Compliance Hotline" below), which gives employees the option of reporting concerns anonymously.
 
Unless specifically authorized by the Company's CEO, CFO, or CLO, or required by law, no employee shall make statements or provide any information on behalf of or about ATMI or its business, customers, or suppliers to the press or any other media, investors, or government representatives, or a representative of any quasi-governmental or regulatory agency, nor shall any ATMI employee on behalf of ATMI, or otherwise, issue any press release or make any other public announcement concerning ATMI or its business, customers, or suppliers.
 
The Company has established an Ethics and Compliance Hotline (sometimes referred to as the "Hotline"), operated by an independent third-party hotline service vendor. The Hotline is one of the ways that can be used by employees to raise concerns or make reports regarding possible violations of laws or regulations, or of the Company's Code, policies or procedures including, but not limited to, concerns or reports regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters. The Hotline offers employees the option of raising their concerns or making their reports anonymously. The Hotline should be used if an employee is uncomfortable raising a concern or reporting a possible violation to his or her manager, the CLO, the Director of Internal Audit or a member of the Compliance Committee.
Raising a concern or making a report, anonymously or otherwise, will not have any adverse consequences for any employee who does so in good faith. This Code and Company policies prohibit retaliation of any kind against any employee who acts in good faith to raise a concern or report a possible violation of laws or regulations or the Company's Code, policies or procedures.
Details regarding the Hotline, and how to access it, are posted on the Company's internal website.

(d) 
Exhibit
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008.
DANBURY, Conn.  February 4, 2009  ATMI, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATMI)
Revenues decreased 29% to $70.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $98.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were approximately $6.3 million of incremental revenues related to a multi-year take-or-pay agreement with a large customer and a contractual settlement with a distributor. Earnings per diluted share were $0.10, compared with $0.40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008 included a net benefit of $0.19 associated with the take-or-pay agreement, the distributor settlement, the settlement of an outstanding insurance claim, and various tax benefits, partially offset by severance costs incurred. The results in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a net benefit of $0.02 from the take-or-pay agreement.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, revenues were $339.1 million, a decrease of 7% from $364.1 million in 2007. Earnings per diluted share decreased to $1.04, from $1.16.
"The fourth quarter turned out far differently than we anticipated. Our key customers experienced weak demand, with many reporting utilization rates well below 50%. We expect this trend to continue at least through the first quarter of 2009," said Doug Neugold, ATMI's Chief Executive Officer. "Accordingly, we have implemented further cost reductions to lower our breakeven point. Although we are responding to the near term challenge of reduced volumes, we remain confident about our long-term strategic growth initiatives and, absent further degradation of conditions, intend to maintain our 2009 R&D spending plans."
"We continue to aggressively manage our expense structure, reviewing it on a regular basis," said Tim Carlson, ATMI's Chief Financial Officer. "We have contingency plans to make further expense reductions, depending on the length and severity of the current global industry decline. Our primary financial objective during this downturn is to maintain our strong balance sheet, which gives us financial flexibility and preserves our strategic options in the current challenging business environment."
"With extremely limited end market visibility, and considering the turmoil and uncertainty in the global economy, we are not currently in a position to provide meaningful earnings guidance near term, or for the full year 2009."
A conference call (dial-in: 888.822.9375) discussing the company's recent financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, February 4, 2009.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Exhibit 99.1.       Press release dated April 22, 2009
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
* 1Q revenues:  $37.4 million * 1Q diluted loss per share: $0.59, including $0.23 of unusual   charges
DANBURY, Conn., April 22, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATMI) today announced that revenues decreased 60% to $37.4 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $92.8 million in the first quarter of 2008. Net loss was $18.4 million, including unusual non-cash pretax charges of $11.2 million, compared with net income of $10.4 million a year ago. Loss per diluted share was $0.59, including $0.23 resulting from the unusual charges, compared with earnings of $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008.
The $11.2 million of unusual charges consists of these non-cash pre-tax items:
- $6.2 million impairment on certain manufacturing, research, and   administrative fixed assets - $2.4 million other-than-temporary-impairment in the market value of   an auction rate security - $1.5 million increase in reserve for bad debts given the effect of   the global economic environment - $1.1 million increase in inventory reserves because of reduced   global demand
"Consistent with the overall semiconductor industry, our first quarter results were affected by record low manufacturing capacity utilization and by aggressive inventory management throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain. The decline in our revenues was further exacerbated by excess inventory in the SDS(r) distribution channel," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer. "We took actions based on our view of the global and industry downturn, but did not anticipate the severe SDS product inventory reductions in the first quarter, which may continue into the second quarter."
"Despite the severe market conditions, ATMI generated positive cash flow from operations during the first quarter and maintained our strong balance sheet," said Tim Carlson, ATMI Chief Financial Officer. "While we have recently seen increased customer activity turn into order rate increases for several of our consumable materials, we do not yet feel confident that a sustainable and meaningful recovery is underway. As a result, we have implemented additional cost reduction and deferral actions to further control near term spending while continuing to allow for investment in strategic opportunities that we believe will lead to sustainable growth as the economy recovers."
A conference call (dial-in: 888.822.9375) discussing the Company's financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, April 22, 2009.

EXHIBIT 99.1
* 2Q revenues: $60.1 million * 2Q diluted loss per share: $0.06
DANBURY, Conn., July 22, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATMI) today announced that revenues were $60.1 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $89.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. Net loss was $1.7 million, including $1.3 million of unusual pretax charges associated with our April cost reduction activities, compared with net income of $9.7 million a year ago. Loss per diluted share was $0.06 compared with earnings of $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, revenues were $97.5 million, compared with $182.3 million in the same period of 2008. Loss per diluted share was $0.64 for the first six months of 2009, including $0.25 loss per share due to $12.5 million of unusual pretax charges, compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.62 in the same period of 2008.
"Improved manufacturing capacity utilizations, particularly within the foundries, drove increased demand for all of our products during the second quarter, in contrast to the significant order contraction we experienced in the first quarter. While our revenues continued to be negatively affected by excess inventory in the SDS(r) distribution channel, we think most of this is behind us," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer and President.
"Our cost reduction programs are on track," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "However, our margins were impacted by the negative product mix associated with lower SDS revenues." Carlson continued, "With limited visibility beyond the third quarter, we remain uncertain whether the recent trend of increasing capacity utilization will continue through the fourth quarter."

    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
-- 3Q revenues:  $72.6 million -- 3Q diluted earnings per share: $0.21
DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 21, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATMI) today announced that revenues were $72.6 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $86.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. Net income was $6.5 million, compared with net income of $10.1 million a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were $0.21, which included $0.04 per diluted share of tax benefits, compared with earnings of $0.32 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008, which included a net benefit of $0.10 per diluted share, primarily from taxes.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, revenues were $170.1 million, compared with $269.0 million in the same period of 2008. Loss per diluted share was $0.43 for the first nine months of 2009, including a net $0.21 loss per diluted share from $12.6 million of unusual pretax charges and the $0.04 net diluted earnings per share tax benefit recognized this quarter, compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the same period of 2008, including the $0.10 net diluted earnings per share benefit.
"Our performance in the quarter was largely consistent with the market. Revenues from our major product lines improved sequentially, reflecting higher wafer starts and improved utilization rates. Combined with our cost control efforts, this enabled us to achieve a solid level of profitability at this stage in the recovery," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer and President. "During the recent downturn we continued to invest in our High Productivity Development capabilities, and believe we have improved our position in emerging technology node-driven opportunities. While industry forecasts point to a more or less flat wafer start environment in the fourth quarter and early 2010, we expect leading customers to begin ramping production at the most advanced nodes, and we remain confident about our long term growth opportunities."
"Our sequential revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong demand for our copper materials and improved revenue contribution from our SDS(R) product line," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "We have executed our cost reduction plans and, in line with the recovery, are beginning to selectively incur certain expenses that had previously been deferred."

We were fortunate to enter the downturn in a strong position, which allowed us to maintain the pace of our strategic investments, in particular, keeping R&D spending consistent year over year," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer and President. "With the support of key customers, we increased and improved our High Productivity Development semiconductor R&D capabilities. Given the opportunities available in the advanced technology generations, for 2010 we are planning for an $8 - $10 million increase in R&D spend. For ATMI, differentiated growth should come from the high-end, very high-performing devices where our customers need the advanced materials and process integration expertise that ATMI offers, and which is the focus of our High Productivity Development investments. 2010 should be a year of growth, with many forecasters predicting healthy wafer start increases that should help strengthen our base business. We expect to s ee the pace of new technology adoption accelerate as we move through 2010."
"Greater-than-market revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong demand for our products used in copper processes as well as our NOWPak products, which are primarily used in flat panel display applications," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "We exited what was a very difficult year having achieved our cost reduction and deferral targets and having generated cash from operations. We maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue business development opportunities."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., April 9, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATMI) reported today in its Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Mr. Frederick C. Flynn, Jr. decided to not seek reelection as a Director of the Company.
Dr. Eugene Banucci, ATMI Chairman, said, "Mr. Flynn joined our Board five years ago. He recently accepted the position of Director of Administration of the City of Stamford, CT, a very demanding and time-consuming role. As a result of this development and considering his other outside Board activities, he felt that his restricted availability currently precludes him from continuing to devote the time required to also be ATMI's Audit Committee chairman and an actively involved Board member of the Company. During his tenure, Fred's experience, ideas, and passion helped improve the practices of the Company's Audit Committee. I speak for the whole Board in wishing him well in his new endeavors."
Mr. Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer, said, "Starting from his election as a Director, Fred's broad business experience and pragmatic approach enabled him to make valuable contributions to the Company and our management team. His contributions are greatly appreciated, and we will miss the insights and the mentoring he provided, especially to our Finance team."

1Q revenues of $85.3 million; earnings per diluted share of $0.27
DANBURY, Conn., April 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATMI, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported revenues of $85.3 million for the first quarter of 2010, which represents significant growth compared to $37.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. Revenue growth across all product lines was driven by higher consumer electronics demand, resulting in increased wafer starts and fab utilization during the first quarter versus the reduced demand associated with the global economic downturn in 2009. Net income was $8.7 million, compared to a net loss of $18.4 million a year ago that included unusual non-cash pretax charges of $11.2 million. Earnings per diluted share was $0.27, including $0.02 of one-time benefit associated with an investment gain and a tax adjustment, compared with a loss per diluted share of $0.59 in the first quarter of 2009 that included $0.23 from unusual charges.
"Customer and end-use device demand was stronger than expected this quarter," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer and President. "There are encouraging signs that support a sustained rebound in the semiconductor industry, and we have confidence that our lower cost infrastructure established during the downturn provides more efficient capacity to handle the increased demand. We are enthusiastic about the near term prospects for our traditional products as well as those for the many products we are developing for leading edge processes."
"We believe our revenues during the quarter grew at a rate greater than the overall market, due to strength in our life sciences products and evidence of some localized SDS inventory stocking," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "Volume, favorable product mix and continued cost control resulted in an increase in gross margin to 48.9%. We generated $19.5 million in cash from operations. Our business model and strong balance sheet provide us financial and strategic flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. As previously announced, increased research and development investment related to our high productivity development platform will cause quarterly R&D spending to increase by approximately $3 million for the remaining quarters of 2010."

DANBURY, Conn., July 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported revenues of $91.0 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $60.1 million in the second quarter of 2009.

3Q revenues: $95.0 million
3Q earnings per diluted share: $0.30, including a $0.05 per diluted share gain from the partial sale of an investment
DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 20, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported revenues of $95.0 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to $72.6 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net income was $9.5 million for the quarter, compared to net income of $6.5 million for the prior year period. Earnings per diluted share were $0.30, including a $0.05 per diluted share gain from the partial sale of an investment, compared to $0.21 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, which included $0.04 per diluted share of tax benefits.
ATMI, Inc.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, revenues were $271.3 million, compared with $170.1 million in the same period of 2009. Net income was $25.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the nine months, including the $0.05 per diluted share gain. For the same period in 2009, net loss was $13.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, which included $0.21 per diluted share of unusual pretax charges and a net tax benefit of $0.04 per diluted share.
"Our strong performance in the quarter is mostly a reflection of semiconductor demand and our well-established position in materials used in advanced processes," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chief Executive Officer and President. "While we had good results across the majority of our businesses, these advanced nodes show the most strength and resiliency. Differentiated growth for ATMI is coming from the ramping of technology generations that use our leading-edge products. Combined with the use of our development capabilities to resolve capacity constraints in existing advanced nodes, we see significant opportunity for ATMI to increase market penetration in both the short- and long-term."
"We realized gross margins of just over 48% due to favorable product mix, and added another $23 million in cash to our balance sheet during the quarter," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "Operating expenses increased from the prior quarter as a result of continued investment in growth markets."

.
As part of the transaction, the Artelis executive team has assumed new roles within ATMI LifeSciences. Additionally, researchers and scientists on staff at Artelis will continue their cell culture research and development as part of ATMI LifeSciences' research and development team.
"Artelis represents a compelling strategic fit for us and expands ATMI's commitment to the life sciences market," said Mario Philips, Senior Vice President and General Manager of ATMI LifeSciences. "While they're still at an early stage from a commercial ramp standpoint, their close collaboration with customers and world-class results in cell line development and cell culture technology allow us to provide the biopharmaceutical sector with the industry's most comprehensive single-use solutions and technical support."

2010 revenues: $367.3 million; earnings per diluted share $1.24, including $0.31 per diluted share from one-time items
DANBURY, Conn., Feb. 2, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues were $96.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, 13% growth compared with $84.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings per diluted share were $0.43, including $0.24 per diluted share from an investment gain and net tax benefits, compared with $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenues were $367.3 million, 44% growth compared with $254.7 million in 2009. Earnings per diluted share were $1.24, including $0.31 per diluted share in investment gains and net tax benefits, compared with a loss per diluted share of $0.21 in 2009, that included $0.23 per diluted share of non-recurring expenses.
"2010 was a year characterized by rebounding revenue and continued investment in ATMI's future growth," said Doug Neugold, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. "Our strong fourth quarter revenue performance is reflective of the strong performance by our key customers and initial commercial success with new cleans products developed with our High Productivity Platform. With several product wins and process of record designations, most notably with our PlanarClean post-chemical mechanical planarization product, we are poised to see meaningful new product revenue in 2011."
Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our fourth quarter revenue growth over the prior year was driven by our copper-related materials, SDS, and LifeSciences products. Our expenses for the quarter were a bit higher than prior quarters due primarily to increased costs related to expedited product shipments and the integration and on-going operating expenses associated with the recently acquired Artelis life sciences business."
"We generated $84 million of cash from operations, ending 2010 with over $150 million in cash and marketable securities. Our strong balance sheet and cash generating business model continue to provide us with the flexibility to pursue strategic investments to drive long-term growth."

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A corrects certain information in our previous Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2011 (the Prior Report).  Exhibit 99.1 to the Prior Report, a press release dated February 2, 2011 issued by ATMI, Inc., stated that we generated $84 million of cash from operations in 2010.  After further consideration of ASC 230, and related interpretive guidance, on February 11, 2011, we determined that it was appropriate  to exclude from our statement of cash flows the $18 million impact of specific operating asset and liability accounts acquired in the November 2, 2010 Artelis S.A. transaction.  This resulted in an $18 million reduction in cash provided by operating activities from the level previously disclosed in the Prior Report.  There was no change in our cash balance, as cash used for investing activities was also reduced by $18 million.  We have, therefore, concluded that net cash provided from operating activities for 2010 was $66 million.  No other data or information in the Prior Report was impacted by this correction.
Statement of Cash Flows,
 
The complete consolidated statement of cash flows will be filed as part of the audited financial statements to be included in ATMIs 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
The information contained in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A is furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., April 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported record revenues of $100.7 million, for the first quarter of 2011 compared with $85.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. Net income was $8.0 million, compared with $8.7 million for the first quarter last year. Earnings per diluted share were $0.25, compared with $0.27 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.
ATMI, Inc.
"The wafer start environment in the first quarter was slightly stronger than we expected it to be, and our base business reflected that strength across the product spectrum. We anticipate this trend to continue into the second quarter," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. "Our new product expectations for 2011 are intact for both our semiconductor and life sciences product lines, and we are working aggressively to accelerate revenue growth from our Artelis acquisition."
Neugold continued, "The investments we have made in High Productivity Development capabilities over the last few years are starting to show tangible returns as leading foundry, memory, and integrated device manufacturers begin to ramp technology nodes where our products are process of record."
"We generated better-than-market revenue growth during the quarter and kept operating expenses flat compared to last quarter," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "Operating expenses increased from the prior year quarter, to $36.4 million. This increase is principally due to our investments in our High Productivity Development platform and operating activities associated with our Artelis acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2010."

EXHIBIT 99.1
2Q revenues: $104.0 million
2Q earnings per diluted share: $0.34; includes $0.05 per diluted share of unusual items
DANBURY, Conn., July 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported record revenues of $104.0 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $91.0 million in the second quarter of 2010. Net income was $11.1 million for the quarter, compared to $7.6 million for the prior year period. Earnings per diluted share were $0.34, including $0.05 per diluted share for an earnout valuation adjustment and a capital-based state tax credit, compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010.
ATMI, Inc.
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, revenues were $204.8 million, compared with $176.3 million in the same period of 2010. Net income was $19.1 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.59 for the six months, including $0.05 per diluted share resulting from the unusual items summarized above, compared to $16.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the same period in 2010.
"We are pleased with the strong growth in revenue and earnings compared with a year ago. Part of that growth comes from growing momentum in 28-nanometer wafer start demand, and the new products we are supplying for that chip generation," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. "However, we agree with reports that suggest there may be incremental softening in overall wafer starts in the second half of 2011. ATMI's focus on leading-edge solutions should help minimize the impact of any industry softness in the second half."
"The sequential revenue growth in the second quarter was driven primarily by sales of our copper materials products to the advanced nodes," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer of ATMI. "We've kept our operating expenses in check, driving increased leverage from the record revenues that were recognized, and we benefited from a $2.1 million reduction in operating expenses in the quarter due to an earnout valuation adjustment and a capital-based state tax credit."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 19, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported revenues of $95.0 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $95.0 million in the third quarter of 2010. Net income was $8.0 million for the quarter, compared to $9.5 million for the prior year period. Earnings per diluted share were $0.25, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.30 in the third quarter of 2010, which included a $0.05 per diluted share gain from the sale of an investment.
ATMI, Inc.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, revenues were $299.8 million, compared with $271.3 million in the same period of 2010. Net income was $27.2 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, including a $0.05 per diluted share gain from unusual items. For the same period in 2010, net income was $25.7 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the nine months, including a $0.05 per diluted share gain from the sale of an investment.
"In the third quarter, our semiconductor customers began decreasing wafer starts and managing inventories, which was reflected in our base business," said Doug Neugold, ATMI Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. "While the overall wafer start environment is a reflection of general economic conditions, we continue to strengthen development interactions and collaborations with the leading customers. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing meaningful growth in 28 nanometer wafer starts, where we have won multiple process-of-record designations, and we are also seeing the expected growth in our LifeSciences product lines."
"Despite a down wafer start environment, ATMI's revenues during the quarter were flat versus the prior year, a result of our strong position in materials used in advanced copper processes. Revenues from these products grew 7%, and represented more than 50% of our total revenues during the quarter," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer of ATMI. "Gross margins declined during the quarter due to unfavorable product mix as our SDS and display product revenues were negatively affected by distribution channel inventory management. ATMI continues to generate significant cash from operations, even in the face of current forecasts that show a temporary dampening in demand."
A conference call (dial-in: 877.766.0748) discussing the Company's financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, October 19, 2011.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On January 19, 2012, ATMI, Inc. (ATMI or the Company) implemented a series of changes to its senior executive compensation structure to closely align executive compensation with Company performance and update senior executive compensation programs and agreements to marketplace best practices.
These changes include:
Total Shareholder Return Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreements
Commencing in 2012, we are replacing the restricted stock portion of our senior executive compensation program  which formerly consisted of a combination of time-vested restricted stock and performance-vested restricted stock based on corporate performance metrics  with market performance restricted stock units that vest based on relative total stockholder return of ATMI stock versus the performance of the Russell 2000 index.  Grants made in 2014 and thereafter will have vesting based solely on three-year Relative Total Shareholder Return and will also have a time-vesting component (with shares earned based on Relative Total Shareholder Return vesting 50% initially and the remaining 50% one year thereafter).  During an initial transition period, grants made in 2012 and 2013 will vest based entirely on Relative Total Shareholder Return versus the Russell 2000 index for one-year, two-year and three-year performance periods, with shares earned vesting at the end of the applicable performance period.
The foregoing description of the Total Shareholder Return Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Agreements, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.5 and 10.6 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference.
Employment Agreement Amendments
On January19, 2012, ATMI entered into Amended and Restated Employment Agreements (the Amended Agreements) with each of: Douglas A. Neugold, its Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Timothy C. Carlson, its Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Daniel P. Sharkey, its Executive Vice President, Business Development and Ellen T. Harmon, its Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary.  The Amended Agreements, which amend and restate each executives existing agreement and amendments into one document, (i) delete the existing tax gross-up provisions that formerly provided for a Company gross-up of any excise taxes that would have been owed by the executive following a change of control pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and replace it with a best net benefit provision requiring the executive to pay any excise taxes due, (ii) reflect certain other changes to conform the agreements to previously implemented and disclosed matters (such as changes of title and the expiration of the initial terms of the agreements), (iii) delete references to perks which are no longer provided, (iv) reflect annual adjustments in base salary levels effective January 1, 2012 (Mr. Neugold  from $525,000 to $550,000; Mr. Carlson  from $318,000 to $328,000; Mr. Sharkey  from $318,000 to $324,000; and Ms. Harmon  from $305,000 to $314,000) and (v) reflect the vesting logistics of Total Shareholder Return Performance Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted under the new senior executive compensation structure in the event of severance following a change of control.
The foregoing description of the Amended Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Amended Agreements, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On January 19, 2012, the Company implemented the ATMI, Inc. Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executives and Directors (the Stock Ownership Guidelines).  The Stock Ownership Guidelines will apply to the Companys independent directors, the Chief Executive Officer, and certain other executives of the Company as may be from time to time determined by the CEO and the Board.
Within five years of becoming subject to the Stock Ownership Guidelines, it is recommended that:
If an individual subject to the Stock Ownership Guidelines has not achieved the applicable goal by the end of the five year time period, the Company may consider that fact in connection with future equity grants.
The foregoing description of the Stock Ownership Guidelines does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Stock Ownership Guidelines, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

(c) in the event of your total disability, meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability (LTD) program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify.
 
2.3           You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c)), including, without limitation any failure by the Boards of Directors of the Company or ATMI Sub to re-elect you to your position as Chief Executive Officer and President;
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;
 
 
2
 
(d) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or
 
(e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option, restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested);
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) days after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice.  In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
 
2.4           The term Cause shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board of Directors of ATMI or ATMI Sub pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting Cause hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as willful misconduct if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group.
 
 
2.5           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to two times your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 24 equal monthly installments.
 
(a)  Payment of your separation pay benefit shall commence on the 30th day after your Separation from Service, and shall continue in monthly installments thereafter until all 24 payments are made; provided that you shall have executed and not revoked the release provided in Section 2.7 on or before such 30th day.
 
 
3
 
(b)  In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in 18 equal monthly installments, without interest, commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
(c)  In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company.
 
2.6           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to amounts specified in Section 2.5, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and within 548 days after a change in control of the Company:
 
(a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and all restricted stock and restricted stock units issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement concerning such restricted stock units; provided, however, that any restricted stock granted prior to December 31, 2011 that is within its first year of grant and remains subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest only at the target level provided in the grant; and provided, further, that any restricted stock units granted after December 31, 2011 that remain subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest based on performance through the date of such Separation of Service; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock or restricted stock units, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan), Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (the 2010 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted, such shares or units shall not vest.  In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Involuntary Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares or restricted stock units that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan, Section 6.1(c) of the 2010 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted.

Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax (the Excise Tax) on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Code).  In the event that you become entitled to any such payments and/or benefits or any other amounts in the nature of compensation upon or following a change in control, (all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits provided under this Employment Agreement, as amended, being hereinafter called Total Payments) that would be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Total Award shall be reduced, if and to the extent provided below, so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.  The reduction provided in the foregoing sentence shall only occur if (i) the net present value of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net present value of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments).  In the event that the Total Award is reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence, such reduction shall first be applied to cash payments to which you are entitled to receive under this Employment Agreement, as amended, and, to the extent such cash payments are not sufficient to satisfy the Excise Tax, then such reduction shall apply to Company equity or equity-linked awards then held by you.  All determinations required to be made under this section shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with any advisors it shall deem appropriate.  If any portion of the Total Payments becomes subject to the Excise Tax, you acknowledge and agree that the payment of such tax, together with any interest and penalties, shall be your sole responsibility.
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.6, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if:  (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a Transaction), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving:  individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.
 
 
5
 
2.7           As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you must execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, within the timeframe specified in Section 2.5, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other executive officer of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you to waive any payments or benefits due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement.
 
2.8           Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating.
 
 
6
 
2.9           You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group.
 
3.           .
Compensation
 
3.1           The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at an annual rate of $550,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your Base Salary).
 
3.2           You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof.
 
4.           .
Other Benefits
 
4.1           You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy.
 
4.2           You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated officers or employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
 
4.3           You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion.
 
4.4           You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company and/or ATMI Sub.  All reimbursements of expenses provided for under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year shall not affect expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (ii) reimbursement shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement of an in-kind benefit (if any) shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
 
7
 
4.5           All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings.
 
5.           .
Other Activities During Employment
 
5.1           Except with the prior written consent of the Companys Board of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
5.2           Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group.
 
5.3           Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles.
 
6.           .
Former Employment
 
6.1           You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party.
 
6.2           You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company.
 
7.           .
Confidentiality
 
7.1           You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as Confidential Information and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you.
 
 
8
 
7.2           Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties.
 
 
7.3           You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group.
 
 
7.4           The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement.
 
8.           .
Post-Employment Activities
 
8.1           You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, absent the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly:
 
 
9
 
(a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development;
 
(b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees;
 
(c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Group's other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or
 
(d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group.
 
8.2           Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s).
 
9.           .
Remedies
 
Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative.
 
 
10
 
10.           .
Miscellaneous
 
10.1           This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
10.2           In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties expressly agree that a court may rewrite and modify such provisions so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.
 
10.3           All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested; or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties):

10.8           This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall constitute a complete and original instrument but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and it shall not be necessary when making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart thereof to account for any other counterpart.

You will be entitled to coverage as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub pursuant to director and officer liability insurance coverage obtained by members of the ATMI Group on the same basis as such coverage is made available to similarly situated officers of ATMI Group companies.

Term of Employment
 
2.1           Your employment is at will, subject to the Company's obligations as hereinafter provided in this Section 2, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (as then in effect) shall continue. Section 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 will apply to termination of your employment by the Company without Cause (other than pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or by you pursuant to Section 2.3.
 
2.2           The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you specifying the reason, to terminate your employment:
 
(a) immediately for Cause (as defined in Section 2.4), subject to the cure rights set forth in Section 2.4 below, or
 
(b) subject to Section 2.5 hereof, at any time without Cause, or
 
(c) in the event of your total disability, meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability (LTD) program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify.
 
2.3           You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c));
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;
 
(d) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or
 
 
2
 
(e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option, restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested);
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) days after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice.  In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
2.4           The term Cause shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board of Directors of ATMI or ATMI Sub or their CEOs pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting Cause hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as willful misconduct if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group.
 
2.5           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 12 equal monthly installments.
 
(a)  Payment of your separation pay benefit shall commence on the 30th day after your Separation from Service, and shall continue in monthly installments thereafter until all 12 payments are made; provided that you shall have executed and not revoked the release provided in Section 2.7 on or before such 30th day.
 
(b)  In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in six equal monthly installments, without interest, commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
 
3
 
(c)  In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company.
 
2.6           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to amounts specified in Section 2.5, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and within 548 days after a change in control of the Company:
 
(a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and all restricted stock and restricted stock units issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement concerning such restricted stock units; provided, however, that any restricted stock granted prior to December 31, 2011 that is within its first year of grant and remains subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest only at the target level provided in the grant; and provided, further, that any restricted stock units granted after December 31, 2011 that remain subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest based on performance through the date of such Separation of Service; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock or restricted stock units, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan), Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (the 2010 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted, such shares or units shall not vest.  In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Involuntary Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares or restricted stock units that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan, Section 6.1(c) of the 2010 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted.

Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax (the Excise Tax) on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Code).  In the event that you become entitled to any such payments and/or benefits or any other amounts in the nature of compensation upon or following a change in control, (all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits provided under this Employment Agreement, as amended, being hereinafter called Total Payments) that would be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Total Award shall be reduced, if and to the extent provided below, so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.  The reduction provided in the foregoing sentence shall only occur if (i) the net present value of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net present value of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments).  In the event that the Total Award is reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence, such reduction shall first be applied to cash payments to which you are entitled to receive under this Employment Agreement, as amended, and, to the extent such cash payments are not sufficient to satisfy the Excise Tax, then such reduction shall apply to Company equity or equity-linked awards then held by you.  All determinations required to be made under this section shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with any advisors it shall deem appropriate.  If any portion of the Total Payments becomes subject to the Excise Tax, you acknowledge and agree that the payment of such tax, together with any interest and penalties, shall be your sole responsibility.
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.6, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if:  (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a Transaction), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the
 
 
5
 
following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving:  individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.
 
2.7           As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you must execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, within the timeframe specified in Section 2.5, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other similarly situated employee of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you to waive any payments or benefits due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement.
 
2.8           Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating.
 
2.9           You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group.

3.           .
Compensation
 
3.1           The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at the annual rate of $328,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your Base Salary).
 
3.2           You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof.
 
4.           .
Other Benefits
 
4.1           You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy.
 
4.2           You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
 
4.3           You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion.
 
4.4           You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company and/or ATMI Sub.  All reimbursements of expenses provided for under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year shall not affect expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (ii) reimbursement shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement of an in-kind benefit (if any) shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

4.5           All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings.
 
5.           .
Other Activities During Employment
 
5.1           Except with the prior written consent of the Companys Board of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
5.2           Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group.
 
5.3           Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles.
 
6.           .
Former Employment
 
6.1           You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party.
 
6.2           You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company.
 
7.           .
Confidentiality
 
7.1           You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as Confidential Information and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you.
 
 
8
 
7.2           Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties.
 
7.3           You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group.
 
7.4           The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement.
 
8.           .
Post-Employment Activities
 
8.1           You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, absent the prior approval of the Companys Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly:
 
(a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development;
 
 
9
 
(b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees;
 
(c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Groups other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or
 
(d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group.
 
8.2           Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s).
 
9.           .
Remedies
 
Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative.
 
10.           .
Miscellaneous
 
10.1           This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
 
10
 
10.2           In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties expressly agree that a court may rewrite and modify such provisions so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.
 
10.3           All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested; or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties):

10.10           You will be entitled to full indemnification with respect to any and all claims and liabilities (and all related legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by you or on your behalf) asserted against you in your capacity as an officer or director of the Company or ATMI Sub or any member of the ATMI Group to the maximum extent provided in their charter documents as amended from time to time, copies of which (as to the Company and ATMI Sub) have been provided to you, and in accordance with Delaware law. You will be entitled to coverage as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub pursuant to director and officer liability insurance coverage obtained by members of the ATMI Group on the same basis as such coverage is made available to similarly situated employees of ATMI Group companies.

Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, effective the date of this Agreement, the Company and you intending to be legally bound agree as follows:
 
1.           .
Position and Responsibilities
 
1.1           You shall serve as Executive Vice President, Business Development of the Company.

You agree to serve as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub, if elected by their respective Boards of Directors, and to perform such executive duties consistent with your position as Executive Vice President, Business Development of the Company as may be reasonably assigned to you by their respective CEOs and Boards of Directors from time to time.
 
1.3           You will duly, punctually and faithfully perform and observe any and all reasonable rules and regulations that the ATMI Group may now or shall hereafter establish (if and once communicated to you) governing the conduct of the ATMI Group's business and generally applicable to similarly situated employees or officers of the ATMI Group.
 
 
 
 
2.           .
Term of Employment
 
2.1           Your employment is at will, subject to the Company's obligations as hereinafter provided in this Section 2, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (as then in effect) shall continue. Section 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 will apply to termination of your employment by the Company without Cause (other than pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or by you pursuant to Section 2.3.
 
2.2           The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you specifying the reason, to terminate your employment:
 
(a) immediately for Cause (as defined in Section 2.4), subject to the cure rights set forth in Section 2.4 below, or
 
(b) subject to Section 2.5 hereof, at any time without Cause, or
 
(c) in the event of your total disability, meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability (LTD) program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify.
 
2.3           You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c));
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;

2
 
(e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option, restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested);
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) days after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice.  In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
2.4           The term Cause shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board of Directors of ATMI or ATMI Sub or their CEOs pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting Cause hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as willful misconduct if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group.
 
2.5           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 12 equal monthly installments.
 
(a)  Payment of your separation pay benefit shall commence on the 30th day after your Separation from Service, and shall continue in monthly installments thereafter until all 12 payments are made; provided that you shall have executed and not revoked the release provided in Section 2.7 on or before such 30th day.
 
(b)  In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in six equal monthly installments, without interest, commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
 
3
 
(c)  In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company.
 
2.6           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to amounts specified in Section 2.5, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and within 548 days after a change in control of the Company:
 
(a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and all restricted stock and restricted stock units issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement concerning such restricted stock units; provided, however, that any restricted stock granted prior to December 31, 2011 that is within its first year of grant and remains subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest only at the target level provided in the grant; and provided, further, that any restricted stock units granted after December 31, 2011 that remain subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest based on performance through the date of such Separation of Service; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock or restricted stock units, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan), Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (the 2010 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted, such shares or units shall not vest.  In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Involuntary Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares or restricted stock units that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan, Section 6.1(c) of the 2010 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted.

Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax (the Excise Tax) on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Code).  In the event that you become entitled to any such payments and/or benefits or any other amounts in the nature of compensation upon or following a change in control, (all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits provided under this Employment Agreement, as amended, being hereinafter called Total Payments) that would be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Total Award shall be reduced, if and to the extent provided below, so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.  The reduction provided in the foregoing sentence shall only occur if (i) the net present value of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net present value of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments).  In the event that the Total Award is reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence, such reduction shall first be applied to cash payments to which you are entitled to receive under this Employment Agreement, as amended, and, to the extent such cash payments are not sufficient to satisfy the Excise Tax, then such reduction shall apply to Company equity or equity-linked awards then held by you.  All determinations required to be made under this section shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with any advisors it shall deem appropriate.  If any portion of the Total Payments becomes subject to the Excise Tax, you acknowledge and agree that the payment of such tax, together with any interest and penalties, shall be your sole responsibility.
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.6, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if:  (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a Transaction), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving:  individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.

2.7           As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you must execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, within the timeframe specified in Section 2.5, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other executive officer of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you to waive any payments or benefits due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement.
 
2.8           Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating.
 
2.9           You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group.

3.           .
Compensation
 
3.1           The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at the annual rate of $324,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your Base Salary).
 
3.2           You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof.
 
4.           .
Other Benefits
 
4.1           You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy.
 
4.2           You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated officers or employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
 
4.3           You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion.
 
4.4           You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company and/or ATMI Sub.  All reimbursements of expenses provided for under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year shall not affect expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (ii) reimbursement shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement of an in-kind benefit (if any) shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

4.5           All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings.
 
5.           .
Other Activities During Employment
 
5.1           Except with the prior written consent of the Companys Board of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
5.2           Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group.
 
5.3           Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles.
 
6.           .
Former Employment
 
6.1           You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party.
 
6.2           You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company.
 
7.           .
Confidentiality
 
7.1           You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as Confidential Information and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you.
 
 
8
 
7.2           Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties.
 
7.3           You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group.
 
7.4           The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement.
 
8.           .
Post-Employment Activities
 
8.1           You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, absent the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly:
 
(a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development;
 
 
9
 
(b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees;
 
(c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Group's other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or
 
(d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group.
 
8.2           Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s).
 
9.           .
Remedies
 
Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative.
 
10.           .
Miscellaneous
 
10.1           This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
 
10
 
10.2           In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties expressly agree that a court may rewrite and modify such provisions so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.
 
10.3           All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested; or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties):

Dear Ellen:
 
ATMI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), wishes to obtain and you wish to provide your services as an employee of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. As used herein, the ATMI Group means the Company, Advanced Technology Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation (ATMI Sub), and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
This Agreement is intended to amend and restate in its entirety your existing Employment Agreement with the Company, dated January 14, 2008, as previously amended April 14, 2008.
 
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, effective the date of this Agreement, the Company and you intending to be legally bound agree as follows:
 
1.           .
Position and Responsibilities
 
1.1           You shall serve as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary of the Company and ATMI Sub. You shall perform your duties at the Companys Danbury, Connecticut headquarters or at such other place as you and the Company shall mutually agree. You shall travel from time to time as reasonably required in connection with the performance of your duties. You shall report directly to the CEO of the Company and ATMI Sub.
 
1.2           Subject to Section 5, you will, to the best of your ability, devote your full business time and good faith efforts to the performance of your duties hereunder and to the business and affairs of the ATMI Group. You agree to serve as an officer of the Company and ATMI Sub, if elected by their respective Boards of Directors, and to perform such executive duties consistent with your position as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary of the Company as may be reasonably assigned to you by their respective CEOs and Boards of Directors from time to time.
 
1.3           You will duly, punctually and faithfully perform and observe any and all reasonable rules and regulations that the ATMI Group may now or shall hereafter establish (if and once communicated to you) governing the conduct of the ATMI Group's business and generally applicable to similarly situated employees or officers of the ATMI Group.
 
 
 
 
2.           .
Term of Employment
 
2.1           Your employment is at will, subject to the Company's obligations as hereinafter provided in this Section 2, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (as then in effect) shall continue. Section 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 will apply to termination of your employment by the Company without Cause (other than pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or by you pursuant to Section 2.3.
 
2.2           The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you specifying the reason, to terminate your employment:
 
(a) immediately for Cause (as defined in Section 2.4), subject to the cure rights set forth in Section 2.4 below, or
 
(b) subject to Section 2.5 hereof, at any time without Cause, or
 
(c) in the event of your total disability, meaning that, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, a mental or physical condition renders you unable or incompetent to carry out the essential functions of your position (with reasonable accommodation to the extent required pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; provided that, if the ATMI Group's long-term disability (LTD) program now or later requires a disability to continue for more than 90 days to be eligible for LTD benefit coverage, you shall be allowed to take unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination under Section 2.2(b) or (c) until such time as you qualify for LTD benefits if such leave will enable you to so qualify.
 
2.3           You shall have the right to terminate your employment for Good Reason, which shall mean a resignation of your employment and your Separation from Service (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) within less than two years following the initial existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without your consent:
 
(a) any material reduction in your position, duties or authority as described herein (except in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or (c)), including, without limitation, any failure by the Boards of Directors of the Company or ATMI Sub to elect or re-elect you to your positions as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary thereof;
 
(b) any material reduction in your Base Salary under Section 3.1 below;
 
(c) any relocation of your primary place of employment more than 50 miles;
 
 
2
 
(d) any other material breach by the Company of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement; or
 
(e) any failure of the Company to have any successor to all or substantially all of the business and properties of the Company assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Company under this Agreement (and any stock option, restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement referred to herein, unless such awards have fully vested);
 
provided, in each case, that a prior written notice specifying the reasons within ninety (90) days after the initial existence of the condition and an opportunity to cure such condition (if curable) shall be afforded the Company, and that Good Reason shall exist only if the Company shall fail to cure such condition within 31 days after its receipt of such prior written notice.  In addition, until your actual Separation from Service you must remain willing and able to continue to perform services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and you must not be in breach of any of your obligations hereunder.
 
2.4           The term Cause shall mean (i) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the ATMI Group but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring you or the ATMI Group into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) your engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the ATMI Group or yourself; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of your duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board of Directors of ATMI or ATMI Sub or their CEOs pursuant to this Agreement; or (v) a material breach by you of any provision of this Agreement or the published policies of the ATMI Group, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), you shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting Cause hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, you shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice. For purposes of this Section 2.4, an action or inaction shall not be treated as willful misconduct if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the ATMI Group.
 
2.5           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to any amounts specified in Section 2.8, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the Company shall pay to you a separation pay benefit equal to your annual Base Salary as of the date of your Separation from Service and paid in 12 equal monthly installments.
 
(a)  Payment of your separation pay benefit shall commence on the 30th day after your Separation from Service, and shall continue in monthly installments thereafter until all 12 payments are made; provided that you shall have executed and not revoked the release provided in Section 2.7 on or before such 30th day.
 
 
3
 
(b)  In the event the value of the separation pay benefit shall exceed two times the lesser of your annualized compensation or the maximum amount that may be taken into account for qualified plan purposes (in each case, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), the excess shall not be paid as provided in (a), above, but instead shall be paid in six equal monthly installments, without interest, commencing as of the first of the month after the date that is six months after your Separation from Service date.
 
(c)  In no event shall payments be accelerated, nor shall you be eligible to defer payments to a later date.
 
In addition, (1) if you elect COBRA continuation of your medical and/or dental insurance benefits, the Company shall contribute to cost of such benefits on the same basis the Company would have contributed to the cost of your coverage had you continued to be an active employee of the Company and (2) for a one-year period from your Separation of Service date, the Company will provide you with disability insurance benefits on the same basis as the Company would have provided you with such benefits had you continued to be an employee of the Company during such period.
 
2.6           Subject to Section 2.7 and in addition to amounts specified in Section 2.5, in the event of the termination of your employment pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 under circumstances that constitute an Involuntary Separation from Service with the Company (as defined for purposes of 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and within 548 days after a change in control of the Company:
 
(a) all stock options held by you to purchase shares of the Company common stock shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for no less than one year after such termination, notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions of any stock option award agreement concerning such options but subject to the expiration date provided in such option agreement without regard to a termination of employment, and all restricted stock and restricted stock units issued to you in connection with your employment shall be fully vested notwithstanding the vesting provisions of any restricted stock agreement concerning such restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement concerning such restricted stock units; provided, however, that any restricted stock granted prior to December 31, 2011 that is within its first year of grant and remains subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest only at the target level provided in the grant; and provided, further, that any restricted stock units granted after December 31, 2011 that remain subject to a performance component which has not yet been determined shall vest based on performance through the date of such Separation of Service; and
 
(b) you will be entitled at a minimum to the target amount under any bonus plans then in effect as if fully earned, which amount shall be paid to you within two and one-half months after the end of the year in which your Separation from Service occurs.
 
 
4
 
To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your restricted stock or restricted stock units, as provided in the preceding sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan), Section 7.3 of the ATMI Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (the 2010 Plan) or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted, such shares or units shall not vest.  In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten (10) days after your Involuntary Separation from Service an amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of the date of your termination of employment of those restricted shares or restricted stock units that do not vest, determined pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan, Section 6.1(c) of the 2010 Plan or a comparable provision of any other plan under which such shares or units are granted.
 
Benefits payable under this Section 2.6 or Section 2.5 or Section 2.8 upon or following a change in control may subject you to an excise tax (the Excise Tax) on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Code).  In the event that you become entitled to any such payments and/or benefits or any other amounts in the nature of compensation upon or following a change in control, (all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits provided under this Employment Agreement, as amended, being hereinafter called Total Payments) that would be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the Total Award shall be reduced, if and to the extent provided below, so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.  The reduction provided in the foregoing sentence shall only occur if (i) the net present value of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net present value of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments).  In the event that the Total Award is reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence, such reduction shall first be applied to cash payments to which you are entitled to receive under this Employment Agreement, as amended, and, to the extent such cash payments are not sufficient to satisfy the Excise Tax, then such reduction shall apply to Company equity or equity-linked awards then held by you.  All determinations required to be made under this section shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with any advisors it shall deem appropriate.  If any portion of the Total Payments becomes subject to the Excise Tax, you acknowledge and agree that the payment of such tax, together with any interest and penalties, shall be your sole responsibility.
 
With respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6, in no event shall you have the right to designate the year of payment.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.6, a change in control of the Company shall be deemed to have taken place if:  (i) a third person, including a person as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of the directors of the Company; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of assets or one or more contested elections, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a Transaction), the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or of any successor to the Company; (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis) in one or more related transactions to a person other than such a sale to a subsidiary of the Company which does not involve a change in the equity holdings of the Company; or (iv) the following individuals cease, for any reason (other than an act of God), to constitute a majority of the number of directors of the Company then serving:  individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment or election or nomination for election was previously so approved.
 
 
5
 
2.7           As a condition to your receipt of any payments and benefits provided for in Section 2.5, you must execute a general release agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, within the timeframe specified in Section 2.5, releasing any and all claims arising out of or related to your employment (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.7), provided that such requirement shall not apply after a change in control of the Company as defined in Section 2.6 above. The form and terms of such release shall not be unreasonable, and shall be no less favorable to you than those applied to any other executive officer of the Company during the preceding two year period. Such release shall not require you to waive any payments or benefits due or other rights upon termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.3 as expressly provided in this Agreement or in respect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or benefit plans and arrangements as expressly provided in this Agreement, or, as expressly provided in the applicable documents governing such plans or arrangements. The terms of such release shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not impose any financial, non-compete or non-solicit obligations or conditions on you that are not already expressly imposed by this Agreement.
 
2.8           Upon termination of your employment for any reason, (i) you shall be entitled to receive accrued salary to the date of termination of employment plus any previously awarded but not yet paid bonus for any completed fiscal year; (ii) you shall be entitled to reimbursement for business expenses incurred through the date of termination consistent with and subject to the Company's policies and the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) your rights under employee benefits plans and arrangements of any members of the ATMI Group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plans and arrangements and applicable law except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides otherwise. Upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any other payment or compensation from any member of the ATMI Group in respect of your employment or the termination thereof except (in the case termination pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.3) as provided in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (if applicable). No later than ten (10) days after the date of termination of your employment for any reason, you shall return to the Company all records and other personal property of the ATMI Group in your possession or control, including all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group but you shall not be required to return copies of this Agreement, any other agreements between you and any member of the ATMI Group and any materials describing the benefit plans or arrangements in which you are participating.
 
 
6
 
2.9           You shall have no duty to mitigate the severance amounts or any other amounts payable to you hereunder, and such amounts shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation or benefits received by you from employment in any capacity or other source following the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group.
 
3.           .
Compensation
 
3.1           The Company shall pay to you for the services to be rendered hereunder a Base Salary at the annual rate of $314,000. Such Base Salary shall be payable periodically in conformity with the Company's payroll practices for executives as modified from time to time but not less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary may be increased but not decreased from time to time as determined by the Company in its discretion (such base salary as it is so increased, your Base Salary).
 
3.2           You shall be entitled to participate in the ATMI Management Incentive Compensation Plan and any other incentive compensation programs for similarly situated executives of the ATMI Group. In connection with this incentive compensation opportunity, it is expected that you will receive a letter on or about January 1 of each year, reflecting your MBO goals for such year. The actual amount of any incentive compensation award to you will be in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee thereof.
 
4.           .
Other Benefits
 
4.1           You shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the vacation policy of the ATMI Group applicable to similarly situated executives as the same may be in effect from time to time, but no less than four weeks per year, without loss of compensation or other benefits to which you are entitled under this Agreement, to be taken at such times as you may reasonably select with carryover to the extent permitted by Company policy.
 
4.2           You will be eligible to participate in all other employee benefits and perquisites generally available to similarly situated officers or employees of the ATMI Group, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
 
4.3           You shall be eligible to receive additional compensation, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion.
 
4.4           You shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of your duties hereunder provided that you shall, as a condition of reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in accordance with the reimbursement policy from time to time adopted by the Company and/or ATMI Sub.  All reimbursements of expenses provided for under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year shall not affect expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (ii) reimbursement shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement of an in-kind benefit (if any) shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
 
7
 
4.5           All compensation payable to you in connection with your employment hereunder shall be subject to all legally required and customary withholdings.
 
5.           .
Other Activities During Employment
 
5.1           Except with the prior written consent of the Companys Board of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, you will not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment or occupation. This provision shall not be deemed to preclude membership in professional societies, lecturing or the acceptance of honorary positions, or participation in charitable and other community activities that are in any case incidental to your employment by the Company, which are not adverse or antagonistic to or competitive with the ATMI Group, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise and are consistent with your obligations regarding the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
5.2           Subject to Section 5.3, during the term of your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the ATMI Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, representative or otherwise, provide services to or have a financial interest in any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever that directly competes with the ATMI Group, in any part of the world, in any line of business engaged in (or planned to be engaged in) by the ATMI Group.
 
5.3           Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall not prohibit you from owning (i) as a passive investor only, an aggregate of not more than one percent (1%) of the total stock or equity interests or publicly-traded options to purchase stock of any publicly-traded company or partnership (and employee stock options of a former employer currently held by you), or (ii) stock or equity interests owned in publicly-available mutual funds or other similar investment vehicles.
 
6.           .
Former Employment
 
6.1           You represent and warrant that your employment by the Company and performance of your obligations hereunder will not conflict with any agreement to which you are a party.
 
6.2           You agree that you will not wrongfully use any confidential information obtained from any prior employment or service relationship in connection with your employment by the Company.
 
 
8
 
7.           .
Confidentiality
 
7.1           You recognize that during the course of your employment hereunder, you will have access to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, business documents or information, research and marketing data, customer lists, computer programs, processes, techniques, know-how, trade secrets, formulae, manufacturing processes and inventions, as well as certain information concerning employees, partners or customers of the ATMI Group. This information shall be known as Confidential Information and shall include all information described in the preceding sentence, whether previously existing, now existing or arising hereafter, whether conceived or developed by others or by you alone or with others, and whether or not conceived or developed during regular business hours. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly known or generally known within the ATMI Group's industry in either case without wrongful disclosure by you.
 
7.2           Subject to Section 7.4, you will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, remove, disclose or cause the disclosure of any Confidential Information except as removal or disclosure may be required or appropriate in connection with your work for the Company. You will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Confidential Information in your possession will not become known to third parties without the Company's prior approval except in the proper conduct of your duties.
 
7.3           You will not, either during the term of your employment with the Company or thereafter, directly or indirectly, without authorization which after your term of employment shall be in writing, use or cause or permit the use of Confidential Information either for your own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ATMI Group.
 
7.4           The provisions of this Section 7 shall not prohibit you from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation or any court order or any government or administrative agency order provided that, in the event that any such disclosure is required, you give the Company prompt notice thereof and cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company with any actions to limit or prevent such disclosure or to obtain a protective order or similar arrangement.
 
8.           .
Post-Employment Activities
 
8.1           You understand and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the ATMI Group and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with the Company, you will have access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the ATMI Group, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of the ATMI Group, there would be a substantial risk to the ATMI Group of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of the ATMI Group and access to the employees and customers of the ATMI Group, solicitation of employees and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to the ATMI Group. Based on the foregoing, for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, absent the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you will not directly or indirectly:
 
 
9
 
(a) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of the ATMI Group in existence or under development;
 
(b) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of the ATMI Group to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by the ATMI Group at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with the ATMI Group; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been terminated by the ATMI Group or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI Group employees;
 
(c) entice, induce or encourage any of the ATMI Group's other employees or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this Section 8; or
 
(d) otherwise wrongfully interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of the ATMI Group.
 
8.2           Upon your written request to the Company specifying the activities proposed to be conducted by you, the Company may in its discretion, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, give you written approval(s) to engage personally in any activity or render services referred to in Section 8.1 upon receipt of written assurances (satisfactory to the Company and its counsel in their discretion) from you and from your prospective employer(s) that the integrity of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8.1 will not in any way be jeopardized or violated by such activities; provided, however, the burden of so establishing the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Company and said counsel shall be upon you and your prospective employer(s).
 
9.           .
Remedies
 
Your duties under Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of your employment with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that any breach by you of any of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of Section 7 or Section 8.1 would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach, without any requirement of proving actual damages or posting of bond. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies are cumulative.
 
 
10
 
10.           .
Miscellaneous
 
10.1           This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors of the Company by reorganization, merger, consolidation or other business combinations and any assignee of all or substantially all of its business and properties or the business or properties of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof, but, except as to any such successor or assignee of the Company, neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned by the Company or you. The foregoing shall not limit the entitlement of your estate upon your death (or your legal representative in the event of your disability) to enforce your rights hereunder (including but not limited to your right to payment of amounts provided hereunder) in accordance with the terms hereof.

(a) The RSUs granted hereby represent the right to potentially receive Common Stock based upon threshold, target and stretch levels determined by the Committee (with the threshold amount reflecting 25% of TNS and the stretch or maximum amount reflecting 175% of TNS) determined as specified below.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be earned by the Participant pursuant to this grant agreement over the performance period determined by the Committee and set forth in the Grant Summary is defined herein as .
MNS
 
 
(b) Common Stock may be earned by the Participant based upon the relative total shareholder return of the Companys Common Stock versus the Russell 2000 Index, as described below:
 
 
(i) a straight-line basis ranging from 25% to 175% of the TNS, with 25% of TNS to be earned for at least threshold RTSR (as defined below) of 25 percentile performance and 175% of TNS to be earned for stretch RTSR of 75 percentile (or greater) performance; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Award would otherwise vest in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) but the annualized return on Common Stock during the applicable performance period is negative, then the Award shall only be earned, in the event of RTSR of 75 percentile (or greater) performance, at 100% of the TNS (subject to negative discretion by the Board of Directors); or
th
th
th
 
(ii) if RTSR is below the 25 percentile but the annualized return on Common Stock during the applicable performance period is above 10%, the Award shall be earned at 25% of the TNS.
th
Promptly following the close of the performance period, the Committee shall determine and certify the level of RTSR performance attained in accordance with the foregoing. Any RSUs that are not earned at the conclusion of the performance period in accordance with either clause (i) or clause (ii) above, based on the level of performance attained and certified, shall thereupon be immediately cancelled.
Upon certification by the Committee of the RTSR actually attained during the performance period, the Common Stock earned thereby based on the level of performance achieved shall thereupon be vested, provided that the Participant has remained continuously employed throughout the performance period, and such number of shares of Common Stock so determined shall be paid to the Participant in a single sum in all events within 74 days following the end of the performance period.
(c) For purposes of this Agreement,  shall mean the percentile within the Russell 2000 of the performance of the Companys Common Stock during the applicable performance period (assuming dividend reinvestment), with the baseline determined by reference to the average price during the 60 trading days prior to the commencement of the applicable performance period versus the average price during the 60 trading days prior to the completion of the applicable performance period.  With respect to the Russell 2000 index such baseline and end point shall be determined on a

If the Participant attempts to dispose of or encumber the Participants RSU, such RSU, together with any property in respect of such shares held by the custodian pursuant to Section 8 hereof, shall be forfeited as of the date of such attempted transfer.

6. .
Termination of Employment
 
(a) .  In the event that the Participants employment with the Company or one of the Companys subsidiaries terminates for any reason (other than by the Company without Cause, as defined below), all unvested RSUs, together with any property in respect of such shares held by the custodian pursuant to Section 8 hereof, shall be forfeited as of the date of such termination of employment. For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed to have a terminated employment or incurred a termination of employment upon (i) the date the Participant ceases to be employed by, or to provide consulting services for, the Company or any Company subsidiary; or (ii) the date the Participant ceases to be a Board member, provided, however, that if the Participant (x) at the time of reference is both an employee or consultant and a Board member, or (y) ceases to be engaged as an employee, consultant or Board member and immediately is engaged in another of such relationships with the Company or any Company subsidiary, the Participant shall not be deemed to have a termination of employment until the last of the dates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above. The Committee, in its discretion, may determine whether any leave of absence constitutes a termination of employment for purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that this Agreement is subject to Code Section 409A, any reference to termination of employment, separation from service or similar terminology in this Agreement shall mean separation from service as defined under the default rules of Treasury regulations issued under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, termination of employment shall not be considered to occur until there is a termination of employment within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii), where the Participants services permanently decrease to less than 20% of the average level of services performed over the preceding 36 month perio

is determined and certified in accordance with Section 4(b), and thereupon the Participant shall vest in that number of RSUs that would otherwise have vested in accordance with Section 4(b) had such employment not been terminated, multiplied by the percentage of which the numerator shall represent (x) the days during the applicable vesting period prior to termination of employment and the denominator of which shall represent (y) the total number of days in the applicable performance period.  The number of shares of Common Stock determined and certified by the Committee to have been earned under this RSU Award shall be paid to the Participant in a single sum in all events within 74 days following the end of the performance period.
 
 
(c)  For purposes of this Agreement,  shall mean (i) the Participants conviction of or plea of with respect to any crime constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved (whether or not involving the Company or its subsidiaries but excluding traffic offenses which do not bring the Participant or the Company or its subsidiaries into disgrace or disrepute); (ii) the Participants engaging in any wrongful act or act of moral turpitude that would be reasonably likely to materially harm the business or reputation or business relationships of the Company or its subsidiaries or the Participant; (iii) willful misconduct or gross neglect in the performance of the Participants duties; (iv) any willful failure or refusal to perform such duties as may reasonably be assigned to the Participant by the Board of Directors; or (v) a material breach by the Participant of any provision of any applicable employment agreement or the published policies of the Company, as amended from time to time; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), the Participant shall have received written notice from the Company setting forth the alleged act or failure to act constituting "Cause" hereunder, and, if such act or failure to act is susceptible of cure, the Participant shall not have cured such act or failure to act within thirty (30) days of such notice.  For purposes of this definition, an action or inaction shall not be treated as "willful misconduct" if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or taken in the good faith belief that it was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Cause
nolo contendere
 
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6, to the extent that this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and Common Stock becomes distributable on account of the Participants separation from service at a time when the Participant is a Specified Employee (as defined in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(h) and 1.409A-1(i), respectively) such Common Stock shall not be distributed until six months and one day following the Participants separation from service.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties that this Agreement either be exempt from, or comply with, Section 409A of the Code, and all regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and this Agreement and the payments of any benefits hereunder will be operated and administered accordingly.  However, neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to any person in the event Section 409A of the Code applies to this Award or any payments hereunder in a transaction that result in adverse tax consequences to the RSU holder or any beneficiaries or transferees.

(e) .  In the event of a change in control as described in Section 10 of the Plan, (A) the Committee shall, notwithstanding the applicable performance period, determine the level of RTSR performance achieved in accordance with Section 4(a) as if the effective date of such change in control represented the end date of the performance period of this RSU Award and the Participant shall be vested in that portion of this Award subject to Section 4(b) to the extent such performance is certified as having been achieved; and (B) the shares of Common Stock underlying the Award, to the extent vested in accordance with this Section 6(e) shall be distributed in a single sum to the Participant upon the change in control.  To the extent that this Agreement is subject to, and not exempt from, Code Section 409A, no payment shall be made unless the change in control constitutes a Change in Control as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).

(b) The Company may require as a condition of the delivery of stock certificates, or book entry, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof that the Participant remit to the Company an amount sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy any federal, state and other governmental tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of the shares represented by such certificate or book entry.
 
 
(c) The Participant shall not be deemed for any purpose to be, or have rights as, a shareholder of the Company by virtue of the RSU grant, except to the extent a stock certificate is issued, or book entry made, as the case may be, therefor pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, and then only from the date such certificate is issued or book entry made.

Exhibit A
SECTION 1           
Purpose
The purpose of the 2010 Stock Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for ATMI, Inc. (the "Company"), its parent (if any) and any subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "Related Companies") the benefits arising from capital stock ownership and the receipt of capital stock-based incentives by those employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies who will be responsible for the Company's future growth and continued success.
The Plan will provide a means whereby (a) employees of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options which qualify as "incentive stock options" ("Incentive Stock Options") under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); (b) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options granted hereunder which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Non-Qualified Options"); (c) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (d) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may be awarded stock in the Company ("Awards"); and (e) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive shares of stock in the Company that are subject to restrictions on transferability and may be forfeited ("Restricted Stock"). Both Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Options are referred to hereafter individually as an "Option" and collectively as "Options." As used herein, the terms "parent" and "subsidiary" mean "parent corporation" and "subsidiary corporation" as those terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code. Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock are referred to hereafter individually as a "Plan Benefit" and collectively as "Plan Benefits." Directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies are referred to herein as "Participants."
SECTION 2           
Administration
          .  The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company whose construction and interpretation of the terms and provisions hereof shall be final and conclusive. Any director to whom a Plan Benefit is awarded shall be ineligible to vote upon his or her Plan Benefit, but Plan Benefits may be granted to any such director by a vote of the remainder of the directors, except as limited below. The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion grant Options, issue shares upon exercise of such Options and grant SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock, all as provided in the Plan. The Board of Directors shall have authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to construe the Plan and its related agreements, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the
2.1
Board of Directors and the Committee
 
- 1 -
 
terms and provisions of the respective Option, SAR, Award and Restricted Stock agreements, which need not be identical, and to make all other determinations in the judgment of the Board of Directors necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Plan, the Board may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to designate the Participants (other than such officer(s)) who will receive Options, SARs, Awards or Restricted Stock under the Plan and the size and terms of each such grant, to the fullest extent permitted by ss.157 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or any successor provision thereto). The Board of Directors may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of any such expediency. No director shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith. The Board of Directors may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to a Compensation Committee or other Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors consisting of at least two members of the Board of Directors. While it is intended that at all times that the Committee acts in connection with the Plan all the members of the Committee shall be: (i) "outside directors" as that term is defined in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(3) (or any successor regulation); and (ii) "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as such terms are interpreted from time to time, the fact that the Committee is not so comprised will not invalidate the grant of any Plan Benefit that otherwise satisfies the terms of the Plan. If the Committee is so appointed, all references to the Board of Directors herein shall mean and relate to such Committee, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
           .  Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits the tax deductibility to publicly held companies of compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain "covered employees" ("Covered Employees"). It is the Company's intention to preserve the deductibility of such compensation to the extent it is reasonably practicable and to the extent it is consistent with the Company's compensation objectives. For purposes of this Plan, Covered Employees of the Company shall be those employees of the Company described in Section 162(m)(3) of the Code.
2.2
Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code
             To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder provides for the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Code 409A and related regulations), other than in accordance with the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan, the material terms of the deferral, to the extent required under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(c)(3) to establish a deferred compensation plan, shall be set forth in the written documentation of the Plan Benefit (including by incorporation by reference, if applicable) prior to the effective date of such award or grant.  To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder does not provide for a deferral of compensation, but may be deferred under the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (or other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of the Company), the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (or such other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of
2.3
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code
.
 
- 2 -
 
the Company) shall govern the deferral and, to the extent necessary, are incorporated herein by reference.
 
SECTION 3           
Eligibility
           .  Participants who are employees of the Company and any Related Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options pursuant to the Plan; provided that no person shall be granted an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan who, at the time such Option is granted, owns, directly or indirectly, Common Stock of the Company possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its Related Companies, unless the requirements of Section 6.6(b) hereof are satisfied. In determining whether this 10% threshold has been reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply. Directors who are not regular employees are not eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options.
3.1
Incentive Stock Options
           .  Non-Qualified Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock may be granted to any Participant.
3.2
Non-Qualified Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock
           .  The granting of Plan Benefits is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take into consideration a Participant's individual circumstances in determining whether to grant an Incentive Stock Option, a Non-Qualified Option, SAR, Award or Restricted Stock. Granting of any Plan Benefit to any Participant shall neither entitle that Participant to, nor disqualify that Participant from, participation in any other grant of Plan Benefits.
3.3
Generally
SECTION 4           
Stock Subject to Plan
Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 9 and 10 hereof, the stock to be offered under the Plan shall consist of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $.01 par value, and the maximum number of shares which will be reserved for issuance, and in respect of which Plan Benefits may be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall not exceed in the aggregate 3,000,000 shares. Such shares may be authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market. If an Option or SAR granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or if a share issued or issuable pursuant to an Award or share of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited, the unpurchased or forfeited shares subject thereto shall again be available for subsequent grants of Plan Benefits under the Plan. Stock issued pursuant to the Plan may be subject to such restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights or other restrictions as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 5           
Granting of Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock
Plan Benefits may be granted under the Plan at any time after May 26, 2010 (the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company) and prior to May 26, 2020; , that nothing in the Plan shall be construed to obligate the
provided, however
 
- 3 -
 
Company to grant Plan Benefits to a Participant or anyone claiming under or through a Participant. The date of grant of Plan Benefits under the Plan will be the date specified by the Board of Directors at the time the Board of Directors grants such Plan Benefits; , that such date shall not be prior to the date on which the Board of Directors takes such action. The Board of Directors shall have the right, with the consent of a Participant, to convert an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan to a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7. Any Plan Benefit may be granted alone or in addition to other Plan Benefits granted under the Plan.
provided, however
 
SECTION 6           
Provisions Applicable to Options and SARs
           .
6.1
Purchase Price and Shares Subject to Options and SARs
(a)           The purchase price per share of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors; , that, except as modified in Section 6.6(b) hereof, the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of such Common Stock on the day the Option is granted.
provided, however
(b)           Options granted under the Plan may provide for the payment of the exercise price by delivery of (i) cash or a check payable to the order of the Company in an amount equal to the exercise price of such Options, (ii) shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the Participant having a fair market value equal in amount to the exercise price of the Options being exercised, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii). The fair market value of any shares of the Company's Common Stock which may be delivered upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof. To the extent permitted by law, the Board of Directors may also permit Participants, either on a selective or aggregate basis, to simultaneously exercise Options and sell the shares of Common Stock thereby acquired, pursuant to a brokerage or similar arrangement approved in advance by the Board of Directors, and to use the proceeds from such sale as payment of the exercise price of such shares.
(c)           If, at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" of a share of the Company's Common Stock for a specific date shall mean (i) the closing reported sale price per share of Common Stock on the national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is principally traded, for the relevant date (or, if there is no such closing sales price reported on the relevant date, then on the immediately preceding day on which a closing sales price was reported), or (ii) if the shares of Common Stock are then traded in an over-the-counter market, the average of the closing reported bid and asked prices for the shares of Common Stock in such over-the-counter market for the relevant date (or, if there are no such closing bid and asked prices reported on the relevant date, then on the immediately preceding day on which closing bid and asked prices were reported), or (iii) if the shares of Common Stock are not then listed on a national securities exchange or traded in
 
- 4 -
 
an over-the-counter market, such value as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
 
(d)           The maximum number of shares with respect to which Options or SARs may be granted to any employee, including any transactions contemplated by Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(2)(vi), shall be limited to 112,500 shares in any calendar year.
           .  Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR and all rights thereunder shall expire on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, but in no event later than ten years from the day on which the Option or SAR is granted.

Duration of Options and SARs
           .
6.3
Exercise of Options and SARs
(a)           Subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times and during such period or periods as shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing such Option or SAR. To the extent that an Option or SAR is not exercised by a Participant when it becomes initially exercisable, it shall not expire but shall be carried forward and shall remain exercisable, on a cumulative basis, until the expiration of the exercise period. No partial exercise may be for less than one (1) full share of Common Stock (or its equivalent).
(b)           The Board of Directors shall have the right to accelerate the date on which any installment of any Option or SAR first becomes exercisable; provided that, without the Participant's written consent, the Board of Directors shall not accelerate the date on which any installment of any Incentive Stock Option (not previously converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7) first becomes exercisable if such acceleration would violate the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d)(1) of the Code, which provides generally that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted to any Participant are exercisable for the first time by such Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000.
           .  No Option or SAR granted under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Non-Qualified Options and SARs, unless the Participant's non-qualified stock option agreement granting such options (the "Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement") or the Participant's SAR agreement granting such SARs (the "SAR Agreement") provides otherwise. Unless otherwise provided by the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or the SAR Agreement, as applicable, during the life of the Participant, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable only by the Participant. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Options or SARs, other than in accordance with the
6.4
Nontransferability of Options and SARs
 
- 5 -
 
applicable terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or SAR Agreement, the Participant's interest in such Options or SARs shall terminate.
 
           .
6.5
Effect of Termination of Employment or Death on Options and SARs
(a)           Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or a Related Company for any reason, including retirement but other than death, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall immediately terminate; , that, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any portion of such Option or SAR which was otherwise exercisable on the date of termination of the Participant's employment may be exercised within the three-month period following the date on which the Participant ceased to be so employed, but in no event after the expiration of the exercise period. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any such exercise may be made only to the extent of the number of shares subject to the Option or SAR which were purchasable or exercisable on the date of such termination of employment. If the Participant dies during such three-month period, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees to the same extent and during the same period that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit.
provided, however
(b)           Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant dies while an employee of the Company or any Related Company, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, for the purchase of or exercise relative to that number of shares and to the same extent that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, the Option or SAR or any unexercised portion thereof shall terminate unless so exercised prior to the earlier of the expiration of six months from the date of such death or the expiration of the exercise period.
(c)           For the purpose of the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5, a Participant shall be deemed to have ceased employment upon (i) the date the Participant ceases to be employed by, or to provide consulting services for, the Company or a Related Company, or any corporation (or any of its subsidiaries) which assumes the Participant's Options or SARs in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies; (ii) the date the Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Company; or (iii) in the case of a Participant who is, at the time of reference, both an employee or consultant and a Board member, the later of the dates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above. For purposes of clause (i) above, a Participant who continues his employment or consulting relationship with a Related Company subsequent to its sale by the Company shall have a termination of employment upon the date of
 
- 6 -
 
such sale. The Board of Directors may in its discretion determine, in accordance with applicable laws, whether any leave of absence or absence in military or government service constitutes a cessation of employment for purposes of the Plan and the impact, if any, of any such leave of absence on Options and SARs theretofore granted under the Plan. Such determinations of the Board of Directors shall be final and conclusive. A person whose status changes from consultant, employee, or member of the Board to any other of such positions without interruption shall not be considered to have ceased employment by reason of such change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that it remains exercisable for more than three months after the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any Related Company for any reason other than death (unless death occurs within the three months following such termination of employment) or disability, or for more than one year following a Participant's ceasing to be an employee as the result of becoming disabled, even if the Participant continues to be affiliated with the Company as a director or consultant.
 
           .  Options granted under the Plan which are intended to be Incentive Stock Options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code shall be designated as Incentive Stock Options and shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:
6.6
Designation of Incentive Stock Options; Limitations
(a)           .  The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the Common Stock for which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year by any person under the Plan (and all other incentive stock option plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000. In the event that Section 422(d)(1) of the Code is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein so that following such amendment such limitation shall differ from the limitation set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the limitation of this Section 6.6(a) shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. An Option shall be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that this limitation is exceeded.
Dollar Limitation
(b)           .  If any Participant to whom an Incentive Stock Option is to be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan is on the date of grant the owner of stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Companies, then the following special provisions shall be applicable to the Incentive Stock Option granted to such individual:
10% Stockholder
(i)           The option exercise price per share of the Common Stock subject to such Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof; and
(ii)           The option exercise period shall not exceed five years from the date of grant. In determining whether the 10% threshold has been
 
- 7 -
 
reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply.
 
(c)           Except as modified by the preceding provisions of this Section 6.6, all of the provisions of the Plan shall be applicable to Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder.
           .  The Board of Directors, at the written request of any Participant, may in its discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such Participant's Incentive Stock Options (or any installments or portions of installments thereof) that have not been exercised on the date of conversion into Non-Qualified Options at any time prior to the expiration of such Incentive Stock Options, regardless of whether the Participant is an employee of the Company or a Related Company at the time of such conversion. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, extending the exercise period of the appropriate installments of such Options. At the time of such conversion, the Board of Directors (with the consent of the Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant's Incentive Stock Options converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Board of Directors takes appropriate action. The Board of Directors, with the consent of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any Incentive Stock Option that has not been exercised at the time of such termination.
6.7
Conversion of Incentive Stock Options into Non-Qualified Options; Termination of Incentive Stock Options
           .  An SAR is the right to receive, without payment, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price, multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The grant of SARs under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the express terms of the Plan, as the Board of Directors shall deem desirable:
6.8

(c)           .  An SAR may be exercised by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Board of Directors or as otherwise provided in any agreement evidencing any SARs. The Board of Directors may provide that an SAR shall be automatically exercised on one or more specified dates.

Fair Market Value
           .  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option or SAR until the date of issue of a stock certificate to the Participant for such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.
6.9
Rights as a Stockholder
           .  In order for the full value of Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees to be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, the Company may intend for such Options and SARs to be treated as "qualified performance-based compensation" as described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e) (or any successor regulation). In such case, Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees shall be subject to the following additional requirements:
6.10
Special Provisions Applicable to Options and SARs Granted to Covered Employees
(a)           such Options and SARs shall be granted only by the Committee; and
(b)           the exercise price of such Options and the grant price of such SARs granted shall in no event be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock as of the date of grant of such Options or SARs, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof.
SECTION 7           
Awards and Restricted Stock
           .  The Board of Directors may grant a Participant an Award or Restricted Stock subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, including, without limitation, restrictions on the pledging, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such shares and the requirement that the Participant forfeit all or a portion of such shares back to the Company upon termination of employment.

Grants of Awards and Restricted Stock
           .  Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise at the time of the grant, Awards and Restricted Stock shall be subject to the following conditions:
7.2

(b)           Any stock certificates evidencing shares issued pursuant to an Award or shares of Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company or such other custodian as the Company in its sole discretion may determine until such shares are free of the restrictions set forth herein. Dividends and other property paid in respect of a share issued pursuant to an Award or a share of Restricted Stock may be held by the Company or other custodian until such share is free of restrictions.
(c)           Certificates for shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, bear a legend to the effect that they are issued subject to specified restrictions.
(d)           Certificates representing the shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, be registered in the name of the Participant and shall be owned by such Participant. Such Participant shall be the holder of record of such shares for all purposes, including voting and receipt of dividends paid with respect to such shares, except that such dividends may be held in escrow until the underlying share is free of restrictions, as described in paragraph (b) above.
(e)           If required by the Board of Directors, a Participant receiving an Award or Restricted Stock shall not make, in connection with such Award or Restricted Stock, the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code.
           .  An Award and shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, alienated, commuted, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of (except, subject to the provisions of such Participant's Agreement, by will or the laws of descent and distribution), or pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of any obligation, or be otherwise encumbered, and are not subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or other legal or equitable process, prior to the lapse of restrictions on such shares, and any attempt at action in contravention of this Section shall be null and void. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Award or shares of Restricted Stock prior to the lapse of the restrictions imposed on such shares, the Participant's interest in such shares shall terminate. The restrictions with respect to Awards and Restricted Stock may lapse based on the passage of a period of time or the achievement of specified performance goals.  In the case of a time-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is in pro rata installments over three years from the date of grant, unless restrictions lapse sooner by virtue of an event specified by the Board of Directors other than the passage of time. In the case of a performance-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is on the first anniversary of the date of grant, upon the achievement of specified performance goals with respect to that one-year period.

The Board of Directors may not amend an award of Restricted Stock to provide that the restrictions thereon shall lapse earlier than as provided in Sections 7.3 and 7.4 hereof.
 
SECTION 8           
Requirements of Law
           .  No shares shall be issued and delivered upon exercise of any Option or the payment of any SAR or the making of any Award or award of Restricted Stock unless and until, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, any applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange on which stock of the same class is then listed, and any other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall have been fully complied with. Each Participant may, by accepting Plan Benefits, be required to represent and agree in writing, for himself or herself and for his or her transferees by will or the laws of descent and distribution, that the stock acquired by him, her or them is being acquired for investment. The requirement for any such representation may be waived at any time by the Board of Directors. An Option or SAR may not be exercised if, in the determination of the Board of Directors, such exercise would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other applicable law.
8.1
Violations of Law

In any such case the Board of Directors shall, in good faith, determine fair market value and may, in its discretion, advance the lapse of any waiting or installment periods and exercise dates.
SECTION 11         
No Special Employment or Other Rights
Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Plan Benefit documentation shall confer upon any Participant receiving a grant of any Plan Benefit any right with respect to the continuation of his or her employment by or other relationship with the Company (or any Related Company) or interfere in any way with the right of the Company (or any Related Company), subject to the terms of any separate employment or other written agreement to the contrary, at any time to terminate such employment or other relationship or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of any Plan Benefit.
SECTION 12         
Amendment of the Plan
The Board of Directors may at any time and from time to time suspend or terminate all or any portion of the Plan or modify or amend the Plan in any respect, , that the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may not (i)
provided, however

With the consent of the affected Participant, the Board of Directors may amend outstanding agreements relating to any Plan Benefit in a manner not inconsistent with the Plan. The Board of Directors, however, may not, without stockholder approval, (i) amend the exercise price of any Option previously awarded pursuant to the Plan by either reducing the exercise price of such Option or canceling such Option and granting a new replacement Option with a lower exercise price or (ii) amend the grant price of any SAR previously awarded pursuant to the Plan by either reducing the grant price of such SAR or canceling such SAR and granting a new replacement SAR with a lower grant price. The Board of Directors hereby reserves the right to amend or modify the terms and provisions of the Plan and of any outstanding Options to the extent necessary to qualify any or all Options under the Plan for such favorable federal income tax treatment (including deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code; , that the consent of a Participant is required if such amendment or modification would cause unfavorable income tax treatment for such Participant.
provided, however
 
SECTION 13         
Withholding

Termination of Employment
 
(a) .  In the event that the Participants employment with the Company or one of the Companys subsidiaries terminates for any reason (other than by the Company without Cause, as defined below), all unvested RSUs, together with any property in respect of such shares held by the custodian pursuant to Section 8 hereof, shall be forfeited as of the date of such termination of employment. For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed to have a terminated employment or incurred a termination of employment upon (i) the date the Participant ceases to be employed by, or to provide consulting services for, the Company or any Company subsidiary; or (ii) the date the Participant ceases to be a Board member, provided, however, that if the Participant (x) at the time of reference is both an employee or consultant and a Board member, or (y) ceases to be engaged as an employee, consultant or Board member and immediately is engaged in another of such relationships with the Company or any Company subsidiary, the Participant shall not be deemed to have a termination of employment until the last of the dates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above. The Committee, in its discretion, may determine whether any leave of absence constitutes a termination of employment for purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that this Agreement is subject to Code Section 409A, any reference to termination of employment, separation from service or similar terminology in this Agreement shall mean separation from service as defined under the default rules of Treasury regulations issued under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, termination of employment shall not be considered to occur until there is a termination of employment within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-

Effect of Termination by the Company without Cause
 
 
(i) In the event that the Participants employment with the Company or one of the Companys subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause during the performance period, this grant shall remain in effect until the RTSR level of performance is determined and certified in accordance with Section 4(b), and thereupon the Participant shall vest in that number of RSUs that would otherwise have vested in accordance with Section 4(b) and Section 4(c) had such employment not been terminated, multiplied by the percentage of which the numerator shall represent (x) the days during the applicable vesting period prior to termination of employment and the denominator of which shall represent (y) the total number of days in the applicable performance period.  The number of shares of Common Stock determined and certified by the Committee to have been earned under this RSU Award shall be paid to the Participant in a single sum in all events within 74 days following the end of the performance period.
 
 
(ii) In the event that the Participants employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated without Cause following the closure of the performance period associated with this Award, then that portion of the Award that is subject to Section 4(c) hereof shall be immediately vested upon the Participants termination of employment, and shall be paid together with any unpaid portion of the vested Award determined and certified under Section 4(b), in a single sum within 74 days following the Participants separation from service.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6, to the extent that this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and Common Stock becomes distributable on account of the Participants separation from service at a time when the Participant is a Specified Employee (as defined in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(h) and 1.409A-1(i), respectively) such Common Stock shall not be distributed until six months and one day following the Participants separation from service.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties that this Agreement either be exempt from, or comply with, Section 409A of the Code, and all regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and this Agreement and the payments of any benefits hereunder will be operated and administered accordingly.  However, neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to any person in the event Section 409A of the Code applies to this Award or any payments hereunder in a transaction that result in adverse tax consequences to the RSU holder or any beneficiaries or transferees.

To the extent that this Agreement is subject to, and not exempt from, Code Section 409A, no payment shall be made unless the change in control constitutes a Change in Control as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).
 
 
(ii)           In the event of a change in control as described in Section 10 of the Plan in which the counterparty assumes the Plan and this Agreement, (A) the Committee shall, notwithstanding the applicable performance period, determine the level of RTSR performance achieved in accordance with Section 4(b) as if the effective date of such change in control represented the end date of the performance period of this RSU Award and the Participant shall be vested in that portion of this Award subject to Section 4(a) to the extent such performance is certified as having been achieved; (B) in such case, that portion of this RSU Award that is subject to additional one years time vesting shall continue to vest in accordance with this Agreement provided that the Participant remains continuously employed during the one year period following the change in control; (C) the shares of Common Stock underlying the Award, to the extent vested in accordance with this Section 6(e)(ii)(A) shall be distributed in a single sum to the Participant upon

Exhibit A
SECTION 1           
Purpose
The purpose of the 2010 Stock Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for ATMI, Inc. (the "Company"), its parent (if any) and any subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "Related Companies") the benefits arising from capital stock ownership and the receipt of capital stock-based incentives by those employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies who will be responsible for the Company's future growth and continued success.
The Plan will provide a means whereby (a) employees of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options which qualify as "incentive stock options" ("Incentive Stock Options") under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); (b) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may purchase stock in the Company pursuant to options granted hereunder which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Non-Qualified Options"); (c) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (d) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may be awarded stock in the Company ("Awards"); and (e) directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies may receive shares of stock in the Company that are subject to restrictions on transferability and may be forfeited ("Restricted Stock"). Both Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Options are referred to hereafter individually as an "Option" and collectively as "Options." As used herein, the terms "parent" and "subsidiary" mean "parent corporation" and "subsidiary corporation" as those terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code. Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock are referred to hereafter individually as a "Plan Benefit" and collectively as "Plan Benefits." Directors, employees and consultants of the Company and any Related Companies are referred to herein as "Participants."
SECTION 2           
Administration
           .  The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company whose construction and interpretation of the terms and provisions hereof shall be final and conclusive. Any director to whom a Plan Benefit is awarded shall be ineligible to vote upon his or her Plan Benefit, but Plan Benefits may be granted to any such director by a vote of the remainder of the directors, except as limited below. The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion grant Options, issue shares upon exercise of such Options and grant SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock, all as provided in the Plan. The Board of Directors shall have authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to construe the Plan and its related agreements, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the
2.1
Board of Directors and the Committee
 
- 1 -
 
terms and provisions of the respective Option, SAR, Award and Restricted Stock agreements, which need not be identical, and to make all other determinations in the judgment of the Board of Directors necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Plan, the Board may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to designate the Participants (other than such officer(s)) who will receive Options, SARs, Awards or Restricted Stock under the Plan and the size and terms of each such grant, to the fullest extent permitted by ss.157 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or any successor provision thereto). The Board of Directors may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of any such expediency. No director shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith. The Board of Directors may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to a Compensation Committee or other Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors consisting of at least two members of the Board of Directors. While it is intended that at all times that the Committee acts in connection with the Plan all the members of the Committee shall be: (i) "outside directors" as that term is defined in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(3) (or any successor regulation); and (ii) "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as such terms are interpreted from time to time, the fact that the Committee is not so comprised will not invalidate the grant of any Plan Benefit that otherwise satisfies the terms of the Plan. If the Committee is so appointed, all references to the Board of Directors herein shall mean and relate to such Committee, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
           .  Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits the tax deductibility to publicly held companies of compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain "covered employees" ("Covered Employees"). It is the Company's intention to preserve the deductibility of such compensation to the extent it is reasonably practicable and to the extent it is consistent with the Company's compensation objectives. For purposes of this Plan, Covered Employees of the Company shall be those employees of the Company described in Section 162(m)(3) of the Code.
2.2
Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code
             To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder provides for the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Code 409A and related regulations), other than in accordance with the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan, the material terms of the deferral, to the extent required under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(c)(3) to establish a deferred compensation plan, shall be set forth in the written documentation of the Plan Benefit (including by incorporation by reference, if applicable) prior to the effective date of such award or grant.  To the extent any Plan Benefit hereunder does not provide for a deferral of compensation, but may be deferred under the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (or other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of the Company), the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Program of ATMI, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (or such other nonqualified deferred compensation plan or program of

the Company) shall govern the deferral and, to the extent necessary, are incorporated herein by reference.
 
SECTION 3           
Eligibility
           .  Participants who are employees of the Company and any Related Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options pursuant to the Plan; provided that no person shall be granted an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan who, at the time such Option is granted, owns, directly or indirectly, Common Stock of the Company possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its Related Companies, unless the requirements of Section 6.6(b) hereof are satisfied. In determining whether this 10% threshold has been reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply. Directors who are not regular employees are not eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options.
3.1
Incentive Stock Options
           .  Non-Qualified Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock may be granted to any Participant.
3.2
Non-Qualified Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock
           .  The granting of Plan Benefits is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take into consideration a Participant's individual circumstances in determining whether to grant an Incentive Stock Option, a Non-Qualified Option, SAR, Award or Restricted Stock. Granting of any Plan Benefit to any Participant shall neither entitle that Participant to, nor disqualify that Participant from, participation in any other grant of Plan Benefits.
3.3
Generally
SECTION 4           
Stock Subject to Plan
Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 9 and 10 hereof, the stock to be offered under the Plan shall consist of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $.01 par value, and the maximum number of shares which will be reserved for issuance, and in respect of which Plan Benefits may be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall not exceed in the aggregate 3,000,000 shares. Such shares may be authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market. If an Option or SAR granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or if a share issued or issuable pursuant to an Award or share of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited, the unpurchased or forfeited shares subject thereto shall again be available for subsequent grants of Plan Benefits under the Plan. Stock issued pursuant to the Plan may be subject to such restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights or other restrictions as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 5           
Granting of Options, SARs, Awards and Restricted Stock
Plan Benefits may be granted under the Plan at any time after May 26, 2010 (the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company) and prior to May 26, 2020; , that nothing in the Plan shall be construed to obligate the
provided, however
 
- 3 -
 
Company to grant Plan Benefits to a Participant or anyone claiming under or through a Participant. The date of grant of Plan Benefits under the Plan will be the date specified by the Board of Directors at the time the Board of Directors grants such Plan Benefits; , that such date shall not be prior to the date on which the Board of Directors takes such action. The Board of Directors shall have the right, with the consent of a Participant, to convert an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan to a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7. Any Plan Benefit may be granted alone or in addition to other Plan Benefits granted under the Plan.
provided, however
 
SECTION 6           
Provisions Applicable to Options and SARs
           .
6.1
Purchase Price and Shares Subject to Options and SARs
(a)           The purchase price per share of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors; , that, except as modified in Section 6.6(b) hereof, the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of such Common Stock on the day the Option is granted.
provided, however
(b)           Options granted under the Plan may provide for the payment of the exercise price by delivery of (i) cash or a check payable to the order of the Company in an amount equal to the exercise price of such Options, (ii) shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the Participant having a fair market value equal in amount to the exercise price of the Options being exercised, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii). The fair market value of any shares of the Company's Common Stock which may be delivered upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof. To the extent permitted by law, the Board of Directors may also permit Participants, either on a selective or aggregate basis, to simultaneously exercise Options and sell the shares of Common Stock thereby acquired, pursuant to a brokerage or similar arrangement approved in advance by the Board of Directors, and to use the proceeds from such sale as payment of the exercise price of such shares.
(c)           If, at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" of a share of the Company's Common Stock for a specific date shall mean (i) the closing reported sale price per share of Common Stock on the national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is principally traded, for the relevant date (or, if there is no such closing sales price reported on the relevant date, then on the immediately preceding day on which a closing sales price was reported), or (ii) if the shares of Common Stock are then traded in an over-the-counter market, the average of the closing reported bid and asked prices for the shares of Common Stock in such over-the-counter market for the relevant date (or, if there are no such closing bid and asked prices reported on the relevant date, then on the immediately preceding day on which closing bid and asked prices were reported), or (iii) if the shares of Common Stock are not then listed on a national securities exchange or traded in
 
- 4 -
 
an over-the-counter market, such value as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
 
(d)           The maximum number of shares with respect to which Options or SARs may be granted to any employee, including any transactions contemplated by Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e)(2)(vi), shall be limited to 112,500 shares in any calendar year.
           .  Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR and all rights thereunder shall expire on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, but in no event later than ten years from the day on which the Option or SAR is granted.
6.2
Duration of Options and SARs
           .
6.3
Exercise of Options and SARs
(a)           Subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, each Option and SAR granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times and during such period or periods as shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing such Option or SAR. To the extent that an Option or SAR is not exercised by a Participant when it becomes initially exercisable, it shall not expire but shall be carried forward and shall remain exercisable, on a cumulative basis, until the expiration of the exercise period. No partial exercise may be for less than one (1) full share of Common Stock (or its equivalent).
(b)           The Board of Directors shall have the right to accelerate the date on which any installment of any Option or SAR first becomes exercisable; provided that, without the Participant's written consent, the Board of Directors shall not accelerate the date on which any installment of any Incentive Stock Option (not previously converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to Section 6.7) first becomes exercisable if such acceleration would violate the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d)(1) of the Code, which provides generally that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted to any Participant are exercisable for the first time by such Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000.
           .  No Option or SAR granted under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Non-Qualified Options and SARs, unless the Participant's non-qualified stock option agreement granting such options (the "Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement") or the Participant's SAR agreement granting such SARs (the "SAR Agreement") provides otherwise. Unless otherwise provided by the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or the SAR Agreement, as applicable, during the life of the Participant, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable only by the Participant. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Options or SARs, other than in accordance with the
6.4
Nontransferability of Options and SARs
 
- 5 -
 
applicable terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement or SAR Agreement, the Participant's interest in such Options or SARs shall terminate.
 
           .
6.5
Effect of Termination of Employment or Death on Options and SARs
(a)           Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or a Related Company for any reason, including retirement but other than death, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall immediately terminate; , that, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any portion of such Option or SAR which was otherwise exercisable on the date of termination of the Participant's employment may be exercised within the three-month period following the date on which the Participant ceased to be so employed, but in no event after the expiration of the exercise period. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, any such exercise may be made only to the extent of the number of shares subject to the Option or SAR which were purchasable or exercisable on the date of such termination of employment. If the Participant dies during such three-month period, the Option or SAR shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees to the same extent and during the same period that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death, except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit.
provided, however
(b)           Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, if a Participant dies while an employee of the Company or any Related Company, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable by the Participant's personal representatives, heirs or legatees, for the purchase of or exercise relative to that number of shares and to the same extent that the Participant could have exercised the Option or SAR on the date of his or her death. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Plan Benefit, the Option or SAR or any unexercised portion thereof shall terminate unless so exercised prior to the earlier of the expiration of six months from the date of such death or the expiration of the exercise period.
(c)           For the purpose of the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5, a Participant shall be deemed to have ceased employment upon (i) the date the Participant ceases to be employed by, or to provide consulting services for, the Company or a Related Company, or any corporation (or any of its subsidiaries) which assumes the Participant's Options or SARs in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies; (ii) the date the Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Company; or (iii) in the case of a Participant who is, at the time of reference, both an employee or consultant and a Board member, the later of the dates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above. For purposes of clause (i) above, a Participant who continues his employment or consulting relationship with a Related Company subsequent to its sale by the Company shall have a termination of employment upon the date of
 
- 6 -
 
such sale. The Board of Directors may in its discretion determine, in accordance with applicable laws, whether any leave of absence or absence in military or government service constitutes a cessation of employment for purposes of the Plan and the impact, if any, of any such leave of absence on Options and SARs theretofore granted under the Plan. Such determinations of the Board of Directors shall be final and conclusive. A person whose status changes from consultant, employee, or member of the Board to any other of such positions without interruption shall not be considered to have ceased employment by reason of such change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that it remains exercisable for more than three months after the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any Related Company for any reason other than death (unless death occurs within the three months following such termination of employment) or disability, or for more than one year following a Participant's ceasing to be an employee as the result of becoming disabled, even if the Participant continues to be affiliated with the Company as a director or consultant.
 
           .  Options granted under the Plan which are intended to be Incentive Stock Options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code shall be designated as Incentive Stock Options and shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

Designation of Incentive Stock Options; Limitations
(a)           .  The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the Common Stock for which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year by any person under the Plan (and all other incentive stock option plans of the Company and any Related Companies) shall not exceed $100,000. In the event that Section 422(d)(1) of the Code is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein so that following such amendment such limitation shall differ from the limitation set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the limitation of this Section 6.6(a) shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. An Option shall be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that this limitation is exceeded.
Dollar Limitation
(b)           .  If any Participant to whom an Incentive Stock Option is to be granted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan is on the date of grant the owner of stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Companies, then the following special provisions shall be applicable to the Incentive Stock Option granted to such individual:
10% Stockholder
(i)           The option exercise price per share of the Common Stock subject to such Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof; and
(ii)           The option exercise period shall not exceed five years from the date of grant. In determining whether the 10% threshold has been

reached, the stock attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply.
 
(c)           Except as modified by the preceding provisions of this Section 6.6, all of the provisions of the Plan shall be applicable to Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder.
           .  The Board of Directors, at the written request of any Participant, may in its discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such Participant's Incentive Stock Options (or any installments or portions of installments thereof) that have not been exercised on the date of conversion into Non-Qualified Options at any time prior to the expiration of such Incentive Stock Options, regardless of whether the Participant is an employee of the Company or a Related Company at the time of such conversion. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, extending the exercise period of the appropriate installments of such Options. At the time of such conversion, the Board of Directors (with the consent of the Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant's Incentive Stock Options converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Board of Directors takes appropriate action. The Board of Directors, with the consent of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any Incentive Stock Option that has not been exercised at the time of such termination.
6.7
Conversion of Incentive Stock Options into Non-Qualified Options; Termination of Incentive Stock Options
           .  An SAR is the right to receive, without payment, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price, multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The grant of SARs under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the express terms of the Plan, as the Board of Directors shall deem desirable:
6.8
Special Rules for Stock Appreciation Rights
(a)           .  SARs may be granted in tandem with, in addition to or completely independent of any other Plan Benefit.
Grant
(b)           .  The grant price of an SAR shall be not less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.
Grant Price
(c)           .  An SAR may be exercised by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Board of Directors or as otherwise provided in any agreement evidencing any SARs. The Board of Directors may provide that an SAR shall be automatically exercised on one or more specified dates.

Fair Market Value
           .  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option or SAR until the date of issue of a stock certificate to the Participant for such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.
6.9
Rights as a Stockholder
           .  In order for the full value of Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees to be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, the Company may intend for such Options and SARs to be treated as "qualified performance-based compensation" as described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.162-27(e) (or any successor regulation). In such case, Options and SARs granted to Covered Employees shall be subject to the following additional requirements:
6.10
Special Provisions Applicable to Options and SARs Granted to Covered Employees
(a)           such Options and SARs shall be granted only by the Committee; and
(b)           the exercise price of such Options and the grant price of such SARs granted shall in no event be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock as of the date of grant of such Options or SARs, determined in accordance with Section 6.1(c) hereof.
SECTION 7           
Awards and Restricted Stock
           .  The Board of Directors may grant a Participant an Award or Restricted Stock subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, including, without limitation, restrictions on the pledging, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such shares and the requirement that the Participant forfeit all or a portion of such shares back to the Company upon termination of employment.

(b)           Any stock certificates evidencing shares issued pursuant to an Award or shares of Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company or such other custodian as the Company in its sole discretion may determine until such shares are free of the restrictions set forth herein. Dividends and other property paid in respect of a share issued pursuant to an Award or a share of Restricted Stock may be held by the Company or other custodian until such share is free of restrictions.
(c)           Certificates for shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, bear a legend to the effect that they are issued subject to specified restrictions.
(d)           Certificates representing the shares issued pursuant to an Award and shares of Restricted Stock shall, as applicable, be registered in the name of the Participant and shall be owned by such Participant. Such Participant shall be the holder of record of such shares for all purposes, including voting and receipt of dividends paid with respect to such shares, except that such dividends may be held in escrow until the underlying share is free of restrictions, as described in paragraph (b) above.
(e)           If required by the Board of Directors, a Participant receiving an Award or Restricted Stock shall not make, in connection with such Award or Restricted Stock, the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code.
           .  An Award and shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, alienated, commuted, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of (except, subject to the provisions of such Participant's Agreement, by will or the laws of descent and distribution), or pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of any obligation, or be otherwise encumbered, and are not subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or other legal or equitable process, prior to the lapse of restrictions on such shares, and any attempt at action in contravention of this Section shall be null and void. If any Participant should attempt to dispose of or encumber the Participant's Award or shares of Restricted Stock prior to the lapse of the restrictions imposed on such shares, the Participant's interest in such shares shall terminate. The restrictions with respect to Awards and Restricted Stock may lapse based on the passage of a period of time or the achievement of specified performance goals.  In the case of a time-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is in pro rata installments over three years from the date of grant, unless restrictions lapse sooner by virtue of an event specified by the Board of Directors other than the passage of time. In the case of a performance-based lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, the earliest that the restrictions may lapse is on the first anniversary of the date of grant, upon the achievement of specified performance goals with respect to that one-year period.
7.3
Nontransferability
           .  Except as otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award or Restricted Stock with respect to a
7.4

- 10 -
 
Participant's death, disability, retirement or similar occurrences, if, prior to the lapse of restrictions applicable to the Award or Restricted Stock, the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or the Related Companies for any reason, any Awards or shares of Restricted Stock as to which the restrictions have not lapsed shall be forfeited to the Company, effective on the date of the Participant's termination of employment. The Board of Directors may not amend an award of Restricted Stock to provide that the restrictions thereon shall lapse earlier than as provided in Sections 7.3 and 7.4 hereof.
 
SECTION 8           
Requirements of Law
           .  No shares shall be issued and delivered upon exercise of any Option or the payment of any SAR or the making of any Award or award of Restricted Stock unless and until, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, any applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange on which stock of the same class is then listed, and any other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall have been fully complied with. Each Participant may, by accepting Plan Benefits, be required to represent and agree in writing, for himself or herself and for his or her transferees by will or the laws of descent and distribution, that the stock acquired by him, her or them is being acquired for investment. The requirement for any such representation may be waived at any time by the Board of Directors. An Option or SAR may not be exercised if, in the determination of the Board of Directors, such exercise would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other applicable law.
8.1
Violations of Law
           .  The intent of this Plan is to qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent any provision of the Plan does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board of Directors and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board of Directors may exercise discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of the revised exemption or its replacement.

In the event that dividends are payable in Common Stock of the Company or in the event there are splits, sub-divisions or combinations of shares of Common Stock of the Company, the number of shares available under the Plan and the maximum number of shares with respect to which Plan Benefits may be granted to an employee in a calendar year shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, and the number of shares deliverable upon the exercise thereafter of any Award or Option previously granted shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, without change in the aggregate purchase price, and the number of shares to which granted SARs relate shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as the case may be, and the grant price of such SARs shall be decreased or increased proportionately, as the case may be.
SECTION 10         
Reorganization
 
- 11 -
 
If the Company is merged or consolidated with another entity and the Company is not the surviving corporation in such transaction, or the property or stock of the Company is acquired by any other entity or in the case of a reorganization or liquidation of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder, shall, as to outstanding Plan Benefits, (i) make appropriate provision for the protection of any such outstanding Plan Benefits by the substitution on an equitable basis of appropriate stock of the Company or of the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity which will be issuable in respect of the shares of Common Stock of the Company; provided only that the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the Plan Benefits immediately after such substitution over the purchase or grant price thereof is not more than the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to such Plan Benefits immediately before such substitution over the purchase or grant price thereof, (ii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that all unexercised Plan Benefits must be exercised within a specified number of days of the date of such notice or such Plan Benefits will be terminated, and/or (iii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that the Company or the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity shall have the right, upon the effective date of any such merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or liquidation, to purchase all Plan Benefits held by each Participant and unexercised as of that date at an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value on such date of the shares subject to the Plan Benefits held by such Participant over the aggregate purchase or grant price therefor, such amount to be paid in cash or, if stock of the merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity is issuable in respect of the shares of the Common Stock of the Company, then, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, in stock of such merged, consolidated, acquiring or otherwise reorganized entity equal in fair market value to the aforesaid amount. In any such case the Board of Directors shall, in good faith, determine fair market value and may, in its discretion, advance the lapse of any waiting or installment periods and exercise dates.
SECTION 11         
No Special Employment or Other Rights
Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Plan Benefit documentation shall confer upon any Participant receiving a grant of any Plan Benefit any right with respect to the continuation of his or her employment by or other relationship with the Company (or any Related Company) or interfere in any way with the right of the Company (or any Related Company), subject to the terms of any separate employment or other written agreement to the contrary, at any time to terminate such employment or other relationship or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of any Plan Benefit.
SECTION 12         
Amendment of the Plan
The Board of Directors may at any time and from time to time suspend or terminate all or any portion of the Plan or modify or amend the Plan in any respect, , that the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may not (i)

With the consent of the affected Participant, the Board of Directors may amend outstanding agreements relating to any Plan Benefit in a manner not inconsistent with the Plan. The Board of Directors, however, may not, without stockholder approval, (i) amend the exercise price of any Option previously awarded pursuant to the Plan by either reducing the exercise price of such Option or canceling such Option and granting a new replacement Option with a lower exercise price or (ii) amend the grant price of any SAR previously awarded pursuant to the Plan by either reducing the grant price of such SAR or canceling such SAR and granting a new replacement SAR with a lower grant price. The Board of Directors hereby reserves the right to amend or modify the terms and provisions of the Plan and of any outstanding Options to the extent necessary to qualify any or all Options under the Plan for such favorable federal income tax treatment (including deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code; , that the consent of a Participant is required if such amendment or modification would cause unfavorable income tax treatment for such Participant.
provided, however
 
SECTION 13         
Withholding
The Company's obligation to deliver shares of stock upon the exercise of any Option or SAR or the granting of any Award or award of Restricted Stock and to make payment upon exercise of any SAR shall be subject to the satisfaction by the Participant of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements.

EXHIBIT 99.1
SDS Direct Transaction Included in Results
Q4 2011 revenues $90.3 million; loss per diluted share $1.49, including a contract termination charge of $1.68 per diluted share for the SDS Direct transaction.
FY2011 revenues $390.1 million; loss per diluted share $0.63, including a contract termination charge of $1.67 per diluted share for the SDS Direct transaction.
DANBURY, Conn., Feb. 1, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011, which included the effects of terminating a license, manufacturing, and distribution agreement associated with ATMI's proprietary Safe Delivery Source, or SDS, gas storage and delivery system and related technologies, in exchange for a $95.0 million cash payment. ATMI recognized a one-time $84.6 million charge ($1.68 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2011 associated with the contract termination. Additionally, as anticipated, revenues were unfavorably impacted by the transaction by $6.9 million, associated with the reversal of previously recognized product shipments into the prior distributor's channel, and inventory burn in regions where the distributor continues to sell product while ATMI secures the appropriate licenses and permits to fully conduct business, partially offset by incremental revenues from the transaction.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues were $90.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, down 6% compared with $96.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly because of the $6.9 million impact from the transaction noted above. The loss per diluted share of $1.49 includes the contract termination charge of $1.68 per diluted share and a $0.14 reduction in earnings per diluted share due to activities associated with the SDS Direct transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings per diluted share were $0.43, including $0.24 per diluted share from an investment gain and net tax benefits.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenues were $390.1 million, after the $6.9 million reduction caused by the SDS Direct transaction as noted above, up 6% compared with $367.3 million in 2010. Loss per diluted share for 2011 was $0.63, including the contract termination charge of $1.67 per diluted share and a $0.15 reduction in earnings per diluted share associated with the SDS Direct transaction. In 2010, earnings per diluted share were $1.24, including $0.31 per diluted share in investment gains and net tax benefits.
The attached tables contain a reconciliation of the U.S. GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, excluding the impact from the SDS Direct transaction.
"2011 was a landmark year for ATMI, despite significant industry headwinds in the second half," said Doug Neugold, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. "We're excited to have completed our SDS Direct transaction, which gives ATMI control of all facets of the safety and productivity standard for implant gas delivery. The transition is progressing as expected and we have already begun to realize numerous benefits from interacting directly with our customers regarding SDS."
"In our leading-edge materials development and commercialization efforts, we have made significant progress with key customers. Our ability to apply great speed and insight to next-generation chip development programs  such as 28-nanometer  is paying off with deeper customer roadmap engagements and growing new product revenue streams. For 2012, although the weak wafer start trends of the second half have carried over to the first quarter, we anticipate revenue growth in excess of industry rates as we further leverage our development, manufacturing, logistics, and support capabilities."
"We generated strong growth in an environment where wafer starts only grew 1-3%, due to the adoption of our wet cleans products in the leading-edge chip generations and our single-use technologies in LifeSciences," said Tim Carlson, Chief Financial Officer. "Our full-year operating margins, excluding the impact from the SDS Direct transaction, improved 200 basis points over the prior year as we continue to leverage our global infrastructure."
"We ended 2011 with $114 million in cash and marketable securities, after spending $95 million for the SDS Direct transaction and $3 million for SDS inventories, giving us ample flexibility to pursue additional strategic growth opportunities. Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the anticipated softness in the first quarter, we are excited about our opportunities for growth given the incremental revenues and cash that are expected to be generated from the SDS Direct transaction and new product revenues in both our Microelectronics and LifeSciences product lines as our customers continue to ramp to volume production."
A conference call (dial-in: 877.766.0748) discussing the Company's financial results and business outlook will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, February 1, 2012. A replay of the call will be available for 48 hours at 855.859.2056 (access code 41878153). An audio webcast of the conference call will be available for 30 days on atmi.com.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

ATMI presents such amounts related to the SDS Direct transaction in a separate column following the dollar amounts shown for the applicable period's results, booked in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and then by presenting a third column showing the non-GAAP results excluding the effect of the SDS Direct transaction.

Exhibits -
99.1. Press release dated April 25, 2012 issued by ATMI, Inc.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., April 25, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2012, which include the effects of the SDS Direct Transaction.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues were $92.6 million for the first quarter of 2012  including a $2.5 million negative effect from the SDS Direct Transaction  down 8% compared with $100.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per diluted share were $0.12, including a $0.04 reduction in earnings per diluted share due to activities associated with the SDS Direct Transaction, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.25 in the first quarter of 2011.
The attached tables contain a reconciliation of the U.S. GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures for the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, excluding the effect from the SDS Direct Transaction. A table containing segment information also is attached.
"Overall, the first quarter was a bit softer than expected in both our Microelectronics and LifeSciences businesses. On the Microelectronics side, excluding the impact of SDS, the decline in first quarter revenue reflected lower sales of trailing edge technology products resulting principally from slower than expected wafer starts at certain customers, and a decline in sales to the display panel market. In our LifeSciences business, the revenue shortfall was the result of timing issues related to the ramping of new single-use production lines," said Doug Neugold, chairman, chief executive officer and president.Looking forward we believe wafer starts are increasing and are confident that our Microelectronics business will improve consistent with anticipated growth in wafer starts, as well as from the expected impact of SDS and ramping new product sales. Across the board, we see the strongest demand at technology's leading edge where our customers are producing as many chips as their capacity will allow. Our focus on solving their materials process issues is vitally important to them as they work hard to ramp additional 28-nanometer volume and capacity to meet customer demand."
"
Neugold continued, "Our SDS Direct integration work and incremental transition spending is rapidly nearing conclusion. With the exception of China, we have moved all of the planned business directly under the ATMI umbrella.  The feedback from customers has been very reinforcing, and we have already initiated collaboration discussions with end users and OEMs focused on improving their processes, validating one of our primary reasons for the deal."
"The Microelectronics industry softness in the quarter was reflected in our results," said Tim Carlson, chief financial officer. "Our Microelectronics revenues were consistent with the industry bottoming during the quarter, particularly with certain foundry customers.  We continued to make additional investments in LifeSciences, to speed product introductions and increase market share, and beginning this quarter, we began reporting segment results, which increases visibility of our LifeSciences activities."
Carlson continued, "We had $2.3 million of SDS integration, transition and operational spending during the quarter and anticipate completing the China business transition during the second quarter.  Once completed, we anticipate incremental revenues of $7 million to $8 million per quarter and $0.08 to $0.09 of incremental quarterly earnings per diluted share as compared to our pre-transaction run-rate."

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
ATMI believes that a breakdown, presented on an income statement line-item basis, of how the SDS Direct transaction contributed to the change in net income and other line items is useful to an understanding of the overall change in the consolidated results of operations for ATMI from one reporting period to another. ATMI presents such amounts related to the SDS Direct transaction in a separate column following the dollar amounts shown for the applicable period's results, booked in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and then by presenting a third column showing the non-GAAP results excluding the effect of the SDS Direct transaction.

Exhibit Index
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., July 25, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2012.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues grew to $105.9 million during the second quarter of 2012 compared with $104.0 million last year, primarily due to the positive contribution from the SDS Direct transaction completed last year and single-use consumables growth in LifeSciences. Net income for the quarter was $11.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $11.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, during the prior year period. The SDS Direct transaction added net revenues of $5.8 million and net income of $2.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.
"In Microelectronics, the positive contribution from our SDS Direct transaction offset lower revenues for display and some older copper products," said Doug Neugold, Chief Executive Officer. "While the overall market environment is uncertain, we continue to see momentum at the leading edge, notably in areas supporting smartphone and tablet demand. In addition to this, we achieved significant LifeSciences growth as our customers continued to migrate towards single-use technology, driving demand for our consumable mixers and bioreactors."
Gross margin was 50.5 percent during the second quarter compared with 47.5 percent last year as a result of SDS Direct. Operating margin was 16.0 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 14.8 percent last year. Net cash provided by operating activities improved 79 percent to $22.6 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $12.7 million in the second quarter a year ago.
Segment Results (all comparisons to same period in 2011)
Microelectronics
Revenues were unchanged at $94.6 million
SDS growth offset by lower revenues for display and some older copper products
Operating income grew more than 7 percent due to SDS impact
LifeSciences
Revenues surged 19 percent to $11.2 million
Demand for higher margin consumable products continues to grow as customers migrate to high-volume manufacturing using single-use technology
Operating loss reduced as higher volumes in consumables and resulting favorable mix improved margins
Outlook
"While we pay close attention to the growing uncertainty as it relates to second half demand, we remain confident in our ability to achieve meaningful growth for the balance of the year," commented Neugold. "We see wafer starts for 2012 modestly stronger than 2011, with typical seasonal patterns expected during the second half. Our customers are continuing to ramp and develop leading-edge technology nodes, and we are working with them to help them solve their material challenges. The SDS Direct transition is behind us and we should experience full-quarter benefits going forward. Our LifeSciences customers continue to move to high-volume production using our single-use technology, although the third quarter is typically affected by the seasonal business cycle in Europe."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 24, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported record revenues and net income for the third quarter of 2012.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues were $108.8 million during the third quarter of 2012 compared with $95.0 million last year, due to the positive contribution from last year's SDS Direct transaction, strong demand for single-use equipment in LifeSciences, and royalties recognized in the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $14.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with $8.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, during the prior year period.
"We clearly encountered a bit of a headwind in the Microelectronics markets that impacted wafer starts during the third quarter," said Doug Neugold, Chief Executive Officer. "Against that backdrop, our SDS Direct transaction continued to perform in line with expectations and our customers are moving forward with production plans for the 28nm and 20nm nodes, where we are well positioned with leading-edge products. LifeSciences revenues, while down from the previous quarter as expected given the European seasonal effect, were strong versus the prior year as customers continue to adopt our single-use technology."
Segment Results (all comparisons to same period in 2011)
Microelectronics
Revenues grew 15 percent to $98.5 million
Results included $7.4 million incremental revenues from SDS Direct and a $2.6 million royalty
Operating income grew 41 percent due to revenue growth, the royalty, and completion of a collaborative development agreement
LifeSciences
Revenues improved 13 percent to $10.4 million
Strong demand for single-use equipment, which will benefit future periods as consumables ramp when customers begin high-volume manufacturing
Operating loss due to continued investment in new product development
Market Environment
"Consistent with external data points, we anticipate wafer starts to be down seasonally in the fourth quarter, impacting Microelectronics," commented Neugold. "However, longer term trends remain favorable as customers increase production at advanced nodes. We are investing in a new manufacturing facility in Korea to work more closely with our Asian customers. LifeSciences is on track for a strong finish to the year after the seasonally soft third quarter, with long-term growth driven by the move to high-volume production using single-use technology. Given the macroeconomic uncertainties, we will continue to closely monitor and control our discretionary cost structures in the near term."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., Feb. 6, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI) today reported revenues and net income for the fourth quarter of 2012.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues improved 11 percent to $100.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $90.3 million during the prior year period. Net income for the quarter was $12.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, including a gain of $0.07 per diluted share for a contingent consideration adjustment, compared with a loss of $47.2 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, during the prior year period due to a one-time $84.6 million pre-tax charge ($1.68 per diluted share) related to the SDS Direct transaction.
"Fourth quarter revenues grew as the incremental contribution from our SDS Direct transaction last year more than offset the negative effects of lower wafer starts," said Doug Neugold, Chief Executive Officer. "Demand for other products in Microelectronics was down as lower wafer starts were coupled with our customers' efforts to manage inventory at the end of the year. LifeSciences revenues grew 20% over the prior year quarter as customers continue to make progress toward launching high-volume manufacturing using our single-use technologies."
Cash, including marketable securities, was $168.5 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of $29.3 million from the third quarter of 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.8 million due to strong earnings and effective working capital management. Capital expenditures were $10.9 million as spending increased on the new manufacturing plant in Korea.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
Microelectronics
Revenues were $89.1 million, up 10 percent compared with last year
Incremental contribution from SDS Direct offset lower wafer starts and inventory management by our customers
Operating income was $23.4 million
LifeSciences
Revenues improved 20 percent compared with last year to $10.9 million
Continued demand for single-use products drove the improvement
Operating income of $1.3 million includes a contingent consideration benefit of $2.4 million related to a reduction in the earnout associated with the 2010 Artelis acquisition
Market Environment
"We expect wafer starts to grow modestly for the full year of 2013, with most growth occurring during the second half of the year after declining sequentially in the first quarter due to seasonal patterns," commented Neugold. "As always, our intent is to grow more rapidly than wafer starts by focusing on new products for leading-edge technology nodes. In LifeSciences, while there is uncertainty in the timing associated with ramping a new technology, we believe growth should be within our long-term expectations as customers continue to ramp manufacturing processes incorporating our single-use mixing and bioreactor systems. Finally, as we continue to generate cash we are well positioned to invest in growth opportunities and create value for our shareholders."

:  You understand and acknowledge that the provisions contained in this section are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of ATMI and are fair and reasonable for numerous reasons, including your receipt of the consideration expressed in this Agreement. In addition, as a result of your executive position with ATMI, you have been given access to significant confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of ATMI, so that, if you were employed by a competitor of ATMI, its subsidiaries or affiliates, there would be a substantial risk to ATMI of your use of its confidential, proprietary or trade secret information. Likewise, you acknowledge that given your access to confidential and proprietary information of ATMI and access to the employees and customers of ATMI, your solicitation of customers or employees, and other activities of the type described in this Section could be particularly damaging to ATMI.

Covenant Not to Compete
 
(i) render any services to, or engage in any activities for, any other person, firm, corporation or business organization which is a supplier of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, which services or activities relate to any product, process, technology or service in existence or under development which substantially resembles or competes with a product, process, or service of ATMI, it subsidiaries or affiliates in existence or under development;

(iii) solicit, induce or encourage any employee of ATMI, its subsidiaries, or affiliates to leave his or her employ or offer or cause to be offered employment to any person who is or was employed by ATMI, its subsidiaries, or affiliates at any time during the six (6) months prior to the termination of your employment with ATMI; the foregoing does not apply to employees who have been involuntarily terminated by ATMI or to your use of general advertising which is not specifically directed at ATMI employees;
 
(iii) entice, induce or encourage any employee of ATMI, its subsidiaries or affiliates or any other person or entity to engage in any activity which, were it done by you, would violate any provision of this section (Covenant Not to Compete); or
 
(iv) otherwise interfere with or disrupt the business or activities of ATMI, its subsidiaries or affiliates.
 
You acknowledge and agree that a breach of your obligations under this paragraph shall cause ATMI, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, therefore, you further acknowledge and agree that in the event of any such breach ATMI shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief without bond from a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
:  The terms of this Agreement, including all facts, circumstances, statements and documents relating thereto, shall not be admissible or submitted as evidence in any litigation in any forum for any purpose other than to secure enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein.
Non-Admissibility
 
:  The validity and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, excluding the conflict of laws principles thereof.  The parties agree that any dispute concerning the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement shall be submitted to a state or federal court in Connecticut for resolution, and to the extent necessary all parties or beneficiaries of this Agreement submit to the jurisdiction of the Connecticut courts and agree to waive any challenge to personal jurisdiction.

:  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and ATMI as to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, supersedes any and all prior oral and written agreements between you and ATMI or any of its predecessors, affiliates or related entities as to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may not be altered, amended or modified except by a further writing signed by you and an authorized representative of ATMI.
Entire Agreement/Amendments
 
:  If any of the provisions, terms or clauses of this Agreement are declared illegal, unenforceable or ineffective by an authority of competent jurisdiction, those provisions, terms and clauses shall be deemed severable, such that all other provisions, terms and clauses of this Agreement shall remain valid and binding upon both parties, , that if the release provisions of this Agreement are deemed illegal, unenforceable or ineffective by an authority of competent jurisdiction, ATMI shall be relieved of any remaining payment obligations hereunder and may seek recovery or offset of any payments made in connection with this Agreement.
Severability
provided however
 
 
 
 
:  You represent and agree that ATMI has provided you with at least twenty-one (21) days to consider this Agreement before signing (although you may opt to sign it sooner), and has encouraged you, and hereby does encourage you in writing, to consult an attorney regarding this Agreement before signing it.  You fully understand your right to consult an attorney regarding your rights and obligations hereunder, including your waiver of all claims.  You may revoke this Agreement by providing written notice to the undersigned on or before the close of business on the seventh day following your execution of this Agreement.  In the event you exercise this right of revocation, this Agreement shall become null and void and you shall receive none of the benefits provided for hereunder.
Review and Revocation Rights
 
 
:  You agree and acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes a knowing and voluntary waiver of all rights or claims you have or may have against ATMI, its employees, agents, officers, directors, predecessors and affiliated entities, or any of them, arising out of your employment by ATMI, or the termination thereof, and that you have no physical or mental impairment of any kind which has interfered with your ability to read and understand the meaning of this Agreement or its terms, and that you are voluntarily entering into this Agreement and in doing so are not acting under coercion or duress, or under the influence of any medication or mind altering chemical of any type.
Knowing and Voluntary Waiver
 
:  You represent and acknowledge that in executing this Agreement you have not relied upon any representation or statement made by ATMI or by any agents, representatives or attorneys of ATMI with regard to the subject matter, basis or effect of this Agreement or otherwise, other than as specifically stated in this written Agreement.
No Extra-Contractual Representations
 
 
Sincerely,
 
ATMI, INC.

C. if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or

Such expenses shall be so paid upon such other reasonable terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.

Scope of Article VIII
8.9 . Each person who shall act as an authorized representative of the corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon rights of indemnification provided by this Article VIII. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the corporation or otherwise shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of an authorized representative existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
Reliance on Provisions
8.10 . If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability
8.11 . In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the authorized
Subrogation

Hillas contributed expertise in financial analysis and technology based business development, along with substantial experience as a director and senior executive of public and private companies in various industries. He helped guide ATMI from a technology-focused start-up company into a global technology company serving microelectronics, life sciences and emerging opportunities in resource and energy fields. He also provided great leadership in his role as chairman of the audit committee. In addition to his service on the Board of ATMI, Hillas has served as the Chief Financial Officer of investment adviser Harding, Loevner LLC, as a Senior Advisor and Partner at private equity firm Warburg Pincus, LLC, and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Envirogen, Inc., an environmentally focused life sciences company.

He was also critical in ensuring smooth leadership transitions as the company grew through many phases. His service and contributions have been substantial, greatly influencing the company on its journey to become what we are today.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DANBURY, Conn., April 24, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:ATMI), a global technology company, today reported revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2013.
ATMI, Inc.
Revenues during the first quarter of 2013 were $99.4 million, a 7 percent increase compared with $92.6 million during the same period last year. Net income was $8.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with $3.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2012.
"We achieved solid revenue growth, despite a challenging demand environment in Microelectronics, due to growth in implant and strong demand for single-use biopharmaceutical products," said Chief Executive Officer Doug Neugold. "Implant benefitted from a full quarter of the SDS Direct transaction, which was transitioning during the first quarter of last year. This was partially offset by material-usage improvements by our customers in copper materials, resulting in modest Microelectronics growth. LifeSciences growth was strong, climbing 24 percent on increased equipment and consumable sales."
Total operating expense decreased 4 percent to $36.4 million due to planned spending reductions and effective cost management. Two significant items during the quarter were the recognition of $0.03 per diluted share of employee separation costs offset by $0.03 per diluted share for tax benefits related to certain 2012 retroactive provisions.
First Quarter 2013 Segment Results
Microelectronics
Revenues were $88.1 million, up 6 percent compared with last year
Growth in implant offset material-usage improvements by customers for our copper materials
Operating income was $25.2 million, an increase of 20 percent due to lower operating expense
LifeSciences
Revenues improved 24 percent compared with last year to $11.3 million
Continued demand for single-use products drove the improvement, with strong growth in both equipment and consumables
Operating loss of $1.3 million compared with a loss of $2.1 million last year
Market Environment
"We are becoming more confident in our 2013 growth outlook," commented Neugold. "Our expectation of modest wafer start growth, with a majority of it occurring during the second and third quarters of the year, seems to be confirmed by customer commentary and industry analysis. While it is clear that advanced devices for mobility applications have momentum, there is commentary that indicates some segments are not as strong. Even with this mix in demand trends for various devices, our focus on the leading edge should allow us to outgrow the market. LifeSciences has begun the year on a strong note, and we expect this will continue throughout the year, with some possible near-term fluctuations associated with customers' ramp patterns for this new technology. As volumes improve, and we maintain our focus on profitability and cash management, we anticipate results will improve through the year."
