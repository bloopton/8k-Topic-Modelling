(b)
                                 
If any Lender or any Issuing Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Lender (or its Lending Office) or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, or any corporation controlling the Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, with any Capital Adequacy Regulation; affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Lender or such Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling the Lender or such Issuing Lender and (taking into consideration such Lender's, such Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's, such Issuing Lender's or corporation's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitments, loans, credits, participations in Letters of Credit, or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the Lender or such Issuing Lender, from time to time, in each case within 10 Business Days after demand by the Lender or such Issuing Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Lender or such Issuing Lender for such increase.
(c)

If a Lender shall determine that it is unlawful to maintain any Offshore Rate Loan, each Borrower shall prepay in full all Offshore Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, either on the last day of the Interest Period
56
thereof if the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans, together with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to .
Section 4.05
.  If the Administrative Agent shall have determined that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Offshore Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan or that the Offshore Rate applicable to any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans, as the case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Majority Lenders revokes such notice in writing.  Upon receipt of such notice, a Borrower may revoke any Request for Extension of Credit then submitted to it.  If a Borrower does not revoke such notice, the Lenders shall make, Convert or Continue the Loans, as proposed by such Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by such Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, Converted or Continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Offshore Rate Loans.

Inability to Determine Rates
                       
.

Solely for purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under this and under , each Offshore Rate Loan made by a Lender (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Offshore Base Rate used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank offshore market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

LOS ANGELES (November 27, 2007)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.
 
AECOM reported net earnings of $29.4 million for the fourth quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29.  This represents an increase of 89.2% over net earnings of $15.5 million for the same period last year.
 
 
 
Fourth-quarter revenue increased to $1.1 billion, 23.2% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.
 
For the full fiscal year 2007, AECOM reported net earnings of $100.3 million, or diluted EPS of $1.15.  This represents an increase of 86.8% over net earnings of $53.7 million last year.  Revenue for the year was $4.2 billion  23.8% higher than fiscal year 2006.
 
AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  AECOM's revenue, net of other direct costs for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2007, increased 32.2% to $669.0 million.  For the full fiscal year 2007, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs increased 26.6% to $2,405.3 million.
 
"Our results were marked by solid, sustained growth across our practice areas and throughout our global operations," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "The growing global infrastructure market is fueling our strong end markets, particularly outside of the U.S.  We continue to leverage AECOM's market and geographic diversification to drive organic growth as well as the acquisitive growth that is the hallmark of our business model."
 
Business Segments
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the PTS segment reported revenue of $917.2 million and operating income of $52.0 million, compared to revenue of $733.4 million and operating income of $37.9 million for the same period during fiscal year 2006.  For the full year, the PTS segment reported revenue of $3.4 billion and operating income of $176.1 million, compared to revenue of $2.8 billion and operating income of $123.3 million during fiscal year 2006.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs increased 32.6% for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2007, to $639.3 million.  For the full fiscal year 2007, PTS revenue, net of other direct costs increased 27.3% to $2,295.7 million.
 
Management Support Services
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the MSS segment reported revenue of $197.1 million and operating income of $6.5 million, compared to revenue of $170.8 million and operating income of $6.3 million for the same period during fiscal year 2006.  For the full year, the MSS segment reported revenue of $818.6 million and operating income of $28.6 million, compared to revenue of $647.2 million and operating income of $22.9 million during fiscal year 2006.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs increased 23.6% for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2007, to $29.7 million.  For the full fiscal year 2007, MSS revenue, net of other direct costs increased 13.3% to $109.6 million.
 
Outlook
AECOM announced backlog and selected-not-booked results totaling $6.0 billion at September 30, 2007, a 25.6% increase year over year.
 
"Our robust market activity continues to grow globally, as we win projects at a strong pace," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president, chief corporate officer and chief financial officer.  "Our non-U.S. revenue growth rate continues to thrive at 38%  far outpacing our already-strong 19% growth rate within the U.S.  Based on these results, we expect our fully diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2008 to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.26."
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 11 a.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast on the Internet at .  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On February 11, 2008, AECOM Technology Corporation ( "AECOM") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to acquire substantially all of Earth Tech, Inc. ("Earth Tech"), a business unit  of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco"), for approximately $510 million in cash.  Earth Tech provides consulting, engineering, and design, build and operate ("DBO") services to water/wastewater, environmental, transportation, and facilities clients globally.
In connection with the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, AECOM will replace Tyco International Finance S.A. ("Seller") on existing parent company guaranties and third party support instruments, such as surety bonds and bank letters of credit, in respect of certain Earth Tech client projects.
After the closing of the Purchase Agreement, AECOM plans to divest certain portions of the Earth Tech business that are not in the consulting, engineering and DBO services areas, and do not otherwise align with AECOM's core business and strategic objectives, but no assurance can be given with respect to the amount, timing and terms of such divestitures.  Certain portions of the Earth Tech business operated by Tyco are not being acquired by AECOM as part of this transaction.
The obligations of AECOM and Seller to complete the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the following: (1) the expiration of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and receipt of applicable non-U.S. antitrust approvals; (2) accuracy in all material respects of each party's representations and warranties; (3) material compliance by each party with its obligations and covenants under the Agreement; and (4) the absence of any injunction, decree or order issued by a governmental entity prohibiting the completion of the transaction.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms.  It is not intended to provide any other factual information about AECOM, Tyco, Earth Tech or Seller or their respective businesses or operations.  The assertions embodied in representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement were made for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

"Losses" shall not include special, incidental or consequential damages (other than consequential or incidental damages payable to a third party), including lost profits or loss of business opportunity.
(b)  If the Indemnified Party actually recognizes a Tax Benefit on account of a Loss or Tax subject to indemnification under this or at any time not later than two (2) years after an indemnification payment is made to the Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss or Tax (as applicable), then, to the extent of the amount of such indemnification payment, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit (net of any Tax cost to the Indemnified Party) at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually recognized by the Indemnified Party.

(c)  The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies and/or indemnification agreements covering any indemnifiable Loss or Tax (as applicable) to the same extent as the Indemnified Party would if such Loss or Tax were not subject to indemnification hereunder.  In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made at any time within two (2) years of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss or Tax (as applicable), then, to the extent of the amount of such indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the recovery (less the costs of recovery to the Indemnified Party, including any increase in premiums or similar costs) shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payment to such Indemnified Party.  The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of any Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by such Indemnifying Party.
 
(d)  In computing the amount of any Tax cost or Tax Benefit pursuant to this , the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any and all Losses or Taxes (as applicable).  For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not be construed to grant the Indemnifying Party any right to review the Tax Returns of the Indemnified Party.

Exhibit 99.1
 
AECOM to acquire Earth Tech from Tyco
 
Strengthens AECOM in infrastructure and environmental markets, expands global footprint
 
LOS ANGELES (Feb. 12, 2008)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Earth Tech, Inc., a business unit of Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC).
 
Earth Tech provides consulting; engineering; and design, build and operate (DBO) services to water/wastewater, environmental, transportation, and facilities clients globally.  Earth Tech had revenue of $1.3 billion in its fiscal year 2007 and employs 7,000 people around the world.
 
The all-cash $510-milllion transaction will combine two world-class professional technical services companies  significantly strengthening AECOM in its key end markets.  "We expect that this transaction will generate shareholder returns above our cost of capital," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.
 
After closing, AECOM plans to divest certain Earth Tech operations that are not in the consulting, engineering and DBO services areas, and do not otherwise align with AECOM's core business and strategic objectives.  AECOM is in the process of finalizing the Earth Tech assets to divest.  AECOM preliminarily estimates that presently-contemplated divestitures could yield proceeds of $175 to $200 million.
 
Dionisio noted the strategic significance of this acquisition.  "By adding Earth Tech to AECOM, we immediately strengthen our position in our core water and wastewater markets.  We also bolster our environmental, facilities, and transportation businesses, while further expanding AECOM's global footprint, particularly in the Americas, U.K./Europe, and Australia/Asia.
 
"For many years, we have partnered with Earth Tech on projects," Dionisio said.  "We know each other very well, and we know the high quality of the work that our respective companies perform.  Based on this experience, our management teams have a strong mutual respect for each other  and we look forward to a smooth, seamless and successful transition.
 
2-2-2
 
"Externally, this merger strengthens our ability to win mega infrastructure assignments, environmentally smart projects and outsourcing by federal agencies," Dionisio added.  "Internally, Earth Tech's addition to AECOM provides tremendous benefits to employees of both firms  opportunities for professional growth and development, and greater opportunities for people to work on important projects."
 
Alan P. Krusi, Earth Tech president and chief executive officer, echoed Dionisio's sentiment.  "This is an exciting time for Earth Tech, our employees and our clients.  We are combining two leading companies with outstanding reputations in the global infrastructure market."
 
Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president, chief corporate officer and chief financial officer, noted that this transaction advances AECOM's strategy and is consistent with its business model of pursuing a healthy balance of organic and acquisitive growth.  "We have a proven track record of successfully integrating acquisitions, and we are confident that we can leverage our integration expertise to seamlessly combine Earth Tech's operations with ours," said Burke.
 
AECOM expects the transaction to be slightly accretive to cash earnings per share (EPS) in its fiscal year 2008.  On a GAAP basis, the transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive to EPS in fiscal year 2008 and accretive in fiscal year 2009.  This transaction is not included in AECOM's revised fiscal year 2008 guidance announced earlier today.
 
The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, is expected to close during the third fiscal quarter for AECOM.
 
AECOM will discuss this transaction and other company developments in its earnings conference call today.

LOS ANGELES (May 8, 2008)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, which ended March 31, 2008.
 
AECOM reported net income of $35.8 million for the second quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 35 cents.  These results represent an increase of 69% over net income of $21.2 million for the same period last year.  Operating income for the second quarter increased 55% year over year to $59.0 million.  For the first six months of fiscal year 2008, AECOM reported net income of $65.3 million and operating income of $103.5 million, an increase of 40% and 52%, respectively.
 
Second-quarter revenue increased to $1.2 billion, 7% higher than the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  AECOM's revenue, net of other direct costs for the three months ended March 31, 2008, increased 27% compared to the same period last year, to $750.8 million.  For the first six months of fiscal 2008, AECOM reported revenue of $2.2 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs of $1.4 billion, an increase of 11% and 31%, respectively.
 
 
"Our second-quarter results were marked by strong global growth," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "During the quarter, we saw continued strength in our U.S. business, while our non-U.S. revenue continued to increase  our non-U.S. revenue now represents 53% of our total revenue."
 
"The global infrastructure market continues to fuel a solid demand for our services," said Dionisio.  "Projects such as our work in support of Abu Dhabi's Ain Khalid Commercial Avenue project, the Los Angeles International Airport Capital Improvement Program, and evolving work for the Libyan Housing and Infrastructure Board highlight the breadth and diversification of our success."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the PTS segment reported revenue of $955.1 million and operating income of $60.6 million, compared to revenue of $843.2 million and operating income of $39.4 million for the same period during fiscal year 2007.  This represents a 13% increase in revenue and a 54% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 27% for the three months ended March 31, 2008, to $710.6 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, the MSS segment reported revenue of $209.1 million and operating income of $14.0 million, compared to revenue of $240.5 million and operating income of $8.3 million for the same period during fiscal year 2007.  This represents a 13% decrease in revenue and a 68% increase in operating income year over year.  Segment results for the quarter were positively affected by the release of key task orders and the resolution of government contract negotiations.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2008, to $40.1 million.
 
Outlook
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $7.1 billion at March 31, 2008, a 20% increase year over year.
 
"AECOM continued to deliver strong results across all of our end markets and geographies during the second quarter," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president, chief corporate officer and chief financial officer.  "Moreover, the $1.2-billion increase in our year-over-year backlog indicates continued strength and solid momentum in our end markets."
 
Dionisio cited the five acquisitions that AECOM has announced year to date as an indicator of the company's execution on its strategic plan.  "Our ability to complement our organic growth with key acquisitions positions us well to leverage the opportunities that we see in the global infrastructure market."
 
Based on its results through the first half of the fiscal year, as well as its strong backlog, AECOM has raised its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2008 to $1.30 to $1.34.
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 11 a.m. EDT, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast on the Internet at www.aecom.com.  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

Item 2.01.
           
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On July 25, 2008, AECOM Technology Corporation ("AECOM") completed its previously announced acquisition of Earth Tech ("Earth Tech"), a business unit of Tyco International Ltd., pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of February 11, 2008, by and among AECOM, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("Tyco") and other seller parties thereto.  A copy of the press release dated July 28, 2008 announcing the completion of the transaction is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
AECOM and Tyco entered into two amendments to the Purchase Agreement, each dated as of July 25, 2008.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement ("Amendment No. 1"), the parties agreed to exclude the purchase of Tyco's equity participations in certain Earth Tech Chinese joint venture operations from the Purchase Agreement and allow those operations to be sold directly by Tyco to third parties.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Purchase Agreement ("Amendment No. 2"), the parties agreed to, among other things, delay the transfer of Earth Tech's United Kingdom businesses to AECOM until certain third party consents to the transaction are obtained.  Pending receipt of such consents, the parties have agreed for AECOM to manage the U.K. operations.  The foregoing descriptions of Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 are qualified in their entirety by the actual terms of Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, copies of which are filed with this report as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.  A copy of the Purchase Agreement was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by AECOM with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
AECOM also announced that it completed the divestiture of certain Earth Tech businesses.  Concurrent with the close of the purchase of Earth Tech, AECOM divested Earth Tech's Water & Power Technologies ("WPT") and North American Contract Operations ("NACO") businesses and Earth Tech's Mexican operations.
 
The value of the divested WPT, NACO and Mexico assets noted above, along with the value of certain assets that have been carved out of the sale transaction with Tyco and other purchase price adjustments, represent a total of $175 million of the original $510 million transaction value.
 
 
Item 2.03
            
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off- Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Earth Tech described in Item 2.01 above, on July 25, 2008 AECOM borrowed approximately $400 million under its existing revolving credit facility.  While outstanding, the borrowing will bear interest, at AECOM's option, at either (a) a base rate (the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or the bank's reference rate), or (b) an offshore, or LIBOR, rate plus a margin which ranges from 0.50% to 1.375%.  The foregoing description of AECOM's revolving credit facility is qualified by reference to the complete copy of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by AECOM with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2007.

AECOM completes acquisition of Earth Tech
 
Two world-class professional technical companies combine
 
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Earth Tech, Inc., a business unit of Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC).
LOS ANGELES (July 28, 2008)
 
Earth Tech provides consulting, engineering and design, build and operate (DBO) services to waste/wastewater, environmental, transportation and facilities clients globally.
 
With the acquisition of Earth Tech, AECOM increases its global presence, particularly in the Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia. AECOM also significantly strengthens its water and wastewater business, while augmenting its leadership position in the environmental, facilities and transportation sectors.
 
"We are delighted to welcome Earth Tech into the AECOM family," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "This transaction, which expands our workforce to more than 40,000 professionals around the world, enhances our ability to take advantage of the growing business opportunities that exist in our global end markets.  We expect this transaction to benefit our clients, employees, and shareholders."
 
AECOM has also completed the divestiture of certain Earth Tech businesses that do not align with its strategic plans and core businesses.  Concurrent with the close of the purchase of Earth Tech, AECOM divested Earth Tech's Water & Power Technologies (WPT) and North American Contract Operations (NACO) businesses and its Mexican operations.
 
The value of the divested WPT, NACO and Mexico assets noted above, along with the value of certain assets that have been carved out of the sale transaction with Tyco, represent a total of $175 million of the original $510 million transaction value.  There remains approximately $50 to $60 million of assets that will be held for sale by AECOM until sale documentation is finalized, all required consents are received and the transactions can be closed.

 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, which ended June 30, 2008.
LOS ANGELES (Aug. 7, 2008)
 
AECOM reported net income of $38.5 million for the third quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 37 cents.  These results represent an increase of 59% over net income of $24.2 million for the same period last year.  Operating income for the third quarter increased 40% year over year to $64.2 million.  For the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, AECOM reported net income of $103.8 million and operating income of $167.7 million, an increase of 46% and 48%, respectively.
 
Third-quarter revenue increased to $1.3 billion, 20% higher than the third quarter of fiscal year 2007.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  AECOM's revenue, net of other direct costs, for the three months ended June 30, 2008, increased 33% compared to the same period last year, to $853.3 million.  For the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, AECOM reported revenue of $3.6 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $2.3 billion, an increase of 14% and 31%, respectively.
 
"Our third-quarter results were marked by strong global growth," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "During the quarter, we saw continued strength in our U.S. business, while our non-U.S. business performed even better.  Our non-U.S. revenue now represents 56% of our gross revenue."
 
"We continue to see solid demand for our services globally throughout the infrastructure market," said Dionisio.  "Projects such as our work in support of Qatar's New Doha Port Project, the largest maritime project in the world; the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, within the White House complex in Washington, D.C.; the Hong Kong International Airport master plan; and the U.S. Navy Guam expansion project highlight the breadth and diversification of our success."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.1 billion and operating income of $70.5 million, compared to revenue of $904.3 million and operating income of $48.8 million for the same period during fiscal year 2007.  This represents a 21% increase in revenue and a 44% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 32% for the three months ended June 30, 2008, to $809.7 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the MSS segment reported revenue of $224.2 million and operating income of $10.6 million, compared to revenue of $196.3 million and operating income of $9.3 million for the same period during fiscal year 2007.  This represents a 14% increase in revenue and a 15% increase in operating income year over year.  Segment results for the quarter were positively affected by the release of key task orders and the resolution of government contract negotiations.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 40% for the three months ended June 30, 2008, to $43.6 million.
 
Outlook
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $7.1 billion at June 30, 2008, a 15% increase year over year.
 
"AECOM continued to deliver strong results across all of our end markets and geographies during the third quarter," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president, chief corporate officer and chief financial officer.  "Moreover, the $900-million increase in our year-over-year backlog indicates continued strength and solid momentum in our end markets."
Dionisio cited the nine acquisitions that AECOM has closed year to date as an indicator of the company's execution on its strategic plan.  "Our ability to complement our organic growth with key acquisitions positions us well to leverage the opportunities that we see in the global infrastructure market."
 
Based on its results through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, as well as its strong backlog, AECOM has raised its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2008 to $1.34 to $1.37.  This range takes into account an expected $0.01 per share dilution related to the recent Earth Tech acquisition.
 
Previously, AECOM expected that EPS would be $1.30 to $1.34, which did not include the $0.01 dilution associated with the Earth Tech acquisition.
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 10 a.m. EDT, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast on the Internet at www.aecom.com.  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
To the Board of Directors of Tyco International, Ltd.:
 
We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Earth Tech (the "Company"), a division of Tyco International, Ltd. ("Tyco" or "Parent") as described in Note 1 to the combined financial statements, as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, and the related combined statements of operations, parent company equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the years then ended. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respect, the combined financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, and the results of its combined operations and its combined cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
As discussed in Note 1, the accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared from the separate records maintained by Tyco and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would have existed or the results of operations that would have occurred if the Company had been operated as an unaffiliated company. Certain expenses represent allocation of costs from Tyco.
 
As discussed in Notes 2 and 13 to the accompanying combined financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), t, on October 1, 2005.
Share-Based Paymen
 
As discussed in Note 11 to the accompanying combined financial statements, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 158, on September 28, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Earth Tech (the "Company") is comprised of a number of entities that are affiliated through common ownership (see Note 2). Earth Tech, Inc., the primary U.S. entity, which manages the Earth Tech group, was established in 1970. The Company was subsequently acquired in 1996 by Tyco International, Ltd. ("Tyco" or the "Parent"), a Bermuda company that is publicly traded on the New York and Bermuda stock exchanges.
 
The Company's principal services involve the treatment and handling of water, wastewater, and hazardous waste. The Company also provides infrastructure and transportation design and construction services for institutional, civic, commercial, and industrial customers; design, construction management, project financing, and facility operating services for water and wastewater treatment facilities for municipal and industrial customers; and transportation engineering and consulting. The Company operates through a network of offices in North America, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region and competes with a number of international, national, regional, and local companies on the basis of price and the breadth and quality of services.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principles of Combination and Consolidation
  The combined financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the following legal entities and their respective 100% owned subsidiaries:
 
 
Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
 
In addition to the legal entities listed above, the combined financial statements include certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows of the consulting and engineering business of Earth Tech Engineering Pty. Limited (an Australian legal entity) and Earth Tech Klartechnik GmbH (German legal entities). These combined financial statements exclude the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows associated with a design/build project within Earth Tech (Infrastructure) Inc., 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The combined financial statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company consolidates variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company bears a majority of the risk related to the entities' potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns and has accordingly determined it is the primary beneficiary. These financial statements present the combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as a subsidiary of the Parent and include allocations of expenses by the Parent and related-party transactions. The combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity. See Note 12 for detail on allocation of expenses.
 
Change in Fiscal Year
  In September 2004, the Company changed its fiscal year end to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September. Starting in fiscal year 2006, 52-week fiscal years will have quarterly periods 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks in length, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal year 2011. As a result of this change, the fiscal year 2005 figures presented in the combined financial statements and related footnotes include 54 weeks of activity, covering a period from September 18, 2004 to September 30, 2005. The additional week of activity in fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily in additional assets of approximately $63.1 million and an increase in operating income of approximately $1.4 million. The change was made to align the Company's fiscal year end with Tyco's fiscal year end.
 
Use of Estimates
  The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in preparing the combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Significant estimates in these combined financial statements include estimated costs to complete long-term fixed-price and nonfixed-price contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future cash flows associated with long-lived assets, fair value of long-lived assets, and deferred income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Revenue Accounting for Contracts
  In accounting for construction, engineering, design, or similar services, the Company follows the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 81-1, . In applying the percentage-of-completion method, revenue is recognized as costs are incurred. Under this method for revenue recognition, the Company estimates the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on contracts.
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts
 
The Company generally utilizes a cost-to-cost approach in applying the percentage-of-completion method, under which revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred, divided by total costs expected to be incurred.
 
Billing practices for percentage-of-completion contracts are governed by the contract terms, based upon costs incurred, achievement of milestones, or agreed-upon schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Billings in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts. When billings are less than recognized revenue, the difference is recorded in unbilled costs, included in accounts receivable in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, the Company charges the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known. In limited circumstances, the Company may use the completed-contract method for specific contracts for which reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or for which inherent hazards make the estimates doubtful. The completed-contract method is also used for the design/build deliverable of a design/build/finance/operate (DBFO) multiple-element arrangement.
 
In 2000, the Company obtained an insurance policy to address the risk and uncertainty associated with a U.S. environmental remediation project. The policy provides for recovery of 90% of remediation costs that exceed $2.4 million with a maximum recovery of $4.5 million. Costs on this project are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying combined statements of operations. Insurance receivables are included in other current and noncurrent assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, and totaled $0.8 million, $1.4 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.
 
In the course of providing its services, the Company routinely subcontracts for services and incurs other direct costs on behalf of its customers. These costs are passed through to customers and are included in the Company's revenue and cost of revenues when it is their responsibility to procure or manage such costs.
Change Orders and Claims
  Change orders are modifications of an original contract that could effectively change the provisions of the contract. Change orders typically result from changes in specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work. Change orders are typically documented and the terms of such change orders are agreed upon with the customer before the work is performed. Sometimes circumstances require that work progress without customer agreement before the work is performed. Claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract price that the Company seeks to collect from its customers or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications or designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Costs related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred. The Company typically records revenue related to change orders and claims in total estimated revenue when the change order is approved and the claim is settled between both parties. In accordance with SOP 81-1, in certain instances the Company records contract revenue related to claims only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reasonably estimated. If both criteria are met, the Company records revenue only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claim have been incurred.
 
Operating and Maintenance Service Contracts
  The Company has entered into a number of arrangements to provide operational, technical, and maintenance services ("O&M") to industrial and municipal customers with water, wastewater, and groundwater treatment facilities globally. The majority of the O&M services relate to lump-sum, long-term contracts that provide the customer with labor, repairs and maintenance, procurement, and other administrative services of operating the facility. The Company recognizes revenue for these arrangements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 13, . Accordingly, the Company principally recognizes the total contract revenue ratably over the contract period unless it is determined that revenue is earned in a different pattern.
Revenue Recognition
 
Multiple-Element Arrangements
  The Company enters into a number of arrangements where the Company is engaged as the primary contractor for the construction of an asset (typically a water or wastewater treatment plant) and, at or around the same time, also enters into an O&M contract with the ultimate plant owner to provide postconstruction service for that asset. These multiple-element arrangements are referred to as design/build/operate (DBO) contracts. The Company follows the provisions in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, , to account for the separate deliverables within the arrangements. Prior to June 15, 2003, the effective date of EITF Issue No. 00-21, the Company accounted for the separate values of the deliverables by reference to the stated contract terms for these arrangements, which typically provided a clear separation between the values of each deliverable. In most instances, the Company determined stated contract values were representative of fair value of each of the deliverables within the DBO arrangements. For arrangements entered into subsequent to the effective date of EITF Issue No. 00-21, fair value of the separate deliverables is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). The Company accounts for the design/build component under the accounting model outlined in SOP 81-1 while the O&M portion of the arrangement is accounted for under the principals of SAB Topic 13. In situations where VSOE cannot be obtained, the Company accounts for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting with revenues and costs associated with the design/build phase of the contract amortized over the term of the operations period.
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
 
The Company enters into DBFO arrangements, which include the financing of the constructed asset, typically over the period O&M services are provided. In these DBFO arrangements where title to the asset remains with the Company during the contract period, the Company accounts for the arrangements under the guidance set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 13, ,and EITF Issue No. 01-8, , where the constructed assets are considered leased assets with the Company acting as the lessor. The Company evaluates the leases for appropriate treatment based on the guidance of FASB Statement No. 13 and accounts for the lease accordingly based on the determined lease classification. Lease inception is typically viewed as occurring when asset construction is complete and the operations period has begun. Accordingly, asset construction costs are capitalized to productive assets and recognized along with related revenue when construction is complete. The allocation of customer payments between principal pay-back, interest pertaining to the financing of the constructed asset, and payments for O&M services is based upon an arrangement's determination of the fair value of each, which is generally determined to be stated contract values.
Accounting for Leases
Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease
Use of Joint Ventures
  As is common to the industry, the Company executes certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures, including partnership and corporate joint ventures. In accordance with the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R), ,the Company has analyzed its significant joint ventures and has classified them into two groups: the first group consists of those VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs' expected residual returns or losses; the second group consists of those VIEs for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs' expected residual returns or losses. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, that will absorb a majority of the VIEs' expected losses, receive a majority of the VIEs' expected residual returns, or both. The enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the primary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. In accordance with FIN No. 46(R), the Company consolidates all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
The Company generally determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing a qualitative analysis of the VIE that includes a review of, among other factors, its capital structure, contractual terms, which interests create or absorb variability, related-party relationships, and the design of the VIE.
 
When the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exerts significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, the Company accounts for its investment in accordance with the equity method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, In applying APB Opinion No. 18, the Company typically records its share of the joint ventures' earnings and losses based on the percentage equity interest in the joint ventures owned by the Company. In certain arrangements, when a joint venture agreement designates allocations among the investors of profits and losses, costs and expenses, distributions from operations or distributions upon liquidation that are different from ownership percentages, the substance of these agreements is considered in determining how an increase or decrease in net assets of the joint venture will affect cash payments to the Company over the life of the joint venture and upon its liquidation and, accordingly, in the amount of the joint ventures' earnings and losses recorded by the Company.
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.
 
Productive Assets
 Productive assets represent internally constructed assets used in the delivery of services associated with the treatment and handling of water and wastewater.
 
Productive Assets  Held For Lease
 Productive assets  held for lease include amounts expended to design and build assets leased to customers.  Such assets are accounted for as either operating leases or sales-type leases in accordance with FASB Statement No. 13.  Productive assets held for lease for which title has been retained are typically leased to customers under operating leases and are recorded at cost, net of depreciation. Productive assets held for lease also includes capitalized costs related to assets for which construction is in progress in relation to DBFO contracts. Upon completion of the Company's design and build services, such assets are typically accounted for as investments in sales-type leases.
 
Productive Assets  Deferred Costs on Uncompleted Contracts
 Productive assets  deferred costs on uncompleted contracts include amounts expended to design and build assets currently in service, for which title has transferred to a customer, under DBO contracts. These arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting due to the inability to obtain VSOE of fair value in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21.
 
Deferred Revenue on Uncompleted Contracts
  Deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts includes billings in excess of recognized revenue. Long-term deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts represents revenue associated with the design and build phase of DBO contracts accounted for as a single unit of accounting due to the inability to obtain VSOE of fair value of the separate deliverables within the arrangements in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21.
 
Cash
 
Cash includes cash on hand and cash in banks.
 
The Company participates in the centralized cash management system of Tyco where cash receipts are transferred to and cash disbursements are funded by Tyco, principally on a daily basis. These advances are subject to the terms of various cash management and loan agreements between the Company and the Parent. The amount of cash reported by the Company represents amounts held outside of the cash management system. Negative cash positions at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, of $19.1 million, $14.7 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, are classified as other current liabilities in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
On occasion, the Company is required to post cash collateral to secure obligations related to various construction projects and other legal obligations. The amount of associated restricted cash was $5.9 million, $3.0 million, and $2.3 million at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. Such restricted cash is primarily related to international warranty and debt reserve obligations on existing projects or bids for potential projects. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, principally all of the Company's restricted cash is classified as a noncurrent asset, included in other assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
  The Company's principal asset is accounts receivable, and substantially all customers are provided trade credit. For the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, approximately 8.0%, 10.8%, and 10.7% of the accounts receivable balance was due from various agencies of the United States government, respectively. Concentrations of credit risk associated with the remaining accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of organizations comprising the Company's customer base, their geographic dispersion, and the credit evaluation process.
 
The accounts receivable amounts reflected in the accompanying combined balance sheets include billed receivables, unbilled costs, and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Unbilled costs represent costs and amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts in progress as of the date of the combined balance sheets but not yet billed to customers. Such amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of certain milestones, or completion of the project. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.
 
In accordance with the terms of certain long-term contracts, customers may be permitted to withhold between 5% and 10% of such billings until completion and acceptance of the contracts. The amounts withheld are referred to as retentions. Final payment of all such amounts withheld might not be received within a one-year period. As a result, retentions have been included in other assets in the combined balance sheets and comprise $14.8 million, $16.2 million, and $19.0 million, net of allowance of $3.7 million, $5.5 million, and $4.3 million as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. It is not practicable to estimate when the amounts of retainage are expected to be collected.
 
Property, Equipment, and Improvements
  Property, equipment, and improvements are carried at historical cost in the combined balance sheets and shown net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are computed by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization for leased assets is recorded over the shorter of the lease life or the estimated useful life of the asset. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of remaining term of lease or the useful life of the leasehold improvement. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, equipment, or improvements, the cost and any related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in earnings. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs, as well as improvements of minor amounts, are recorded to expense in the current period.
 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
 
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
  The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When it is probable that the undiscounted expected future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value.
 
Translation of Foreign Currency
  For the Company's operations that account in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Transactions involving currencies other than the U.S. dollar are recovered at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time the transactions are made. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected within Parent company equity (deficit) and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in other expenses (income) in the combined statements of operations. The Company does not operate in any highly inflationary environments.
Income Taxes
  In determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, the Company must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, included in both other current assets and other assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets, which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
 
In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and the forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, the Company develops assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses.
 
The Company currently has recorded significant valuation allowances that it intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. The income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including, but not limited to, any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision.
 
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company's results of combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
 
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across global operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether, and to the extent to which it is probable that, additional taxes will be due and such amounts are reasonably estimable. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
  As defined by FASB Statement No. 107, , the Company's financial instruments include transactions with the Parent and related parties included within Parent company equity (deficit) and amounts due from (to) Tyco and affiliates in the accompanying combined balance sheets. Management is not able to practically estimate the fair value of these transactions with the Parent and related parties due to the related-party nature of these balances.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
Additional financial instruments include accounts receivable and other amounts arising out of normal contract activities, including retentions that may be settled beyond one year, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, approximate fair value at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005.
 
Parent Company Investment and Amounts Due From (To) Tyco and Affiliates
  The net cash activity associated with the Parent, which includes the activity associated with the cash management system, is recorded as a net capital contribution from or distribution to the Parent in the combined statements of Parent company equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss) and in amounts due from (to) Tyco and affiliates in the combined balance sheets. The net cash activity with the Parent was recorded as a net capital distribution to the Parent and amounted to $9.0 million, $31.5 million, and $31.4 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. In addition, the amounts due from (to) Tyco and affiliates include the noncash expenses allocated from the Parent that are discussed in Note 12. Net interest earned or paid on advances between Tyco and the Company is reflected in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
  Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco and the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), , which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the combined financial statements based on fair value. FASB Statement No. 123(R) revises FASB Statement No. 123, as amended, , and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, . The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2005, and all share-based payments granted subsequent to September 30, 2005, over the related vesting period. Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company applied the intrinsic-value-based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Prior-period results have not been restated upon the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R). Due to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R), the Company's combined results from continuing operations for 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense totaling $3.3 million.

Accrued Expenses
  Accrued expenses consist of accrued salaries and wages, vacations, legal and audit fees, insurance, bonus, taxes, and other accruals. Accrued vacations and holidays were $17.8 million, $18.3 million, and $18.8 million at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively.
 
FCPA Matters
  In connection with the Company's operations in Germany, in 2005 and 2006 the Company engaged in reviews of the internal controls and legal compliance procedures within the finance and accounting departments of Earth Tech Klartechnik GmbH (BUT). The Company's internal investigations revealed that certain payments made by a subcontractor for a third-party investor partner in a joint venture in which BUT was a party may have been made in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Although the recipients of the payments could not be ascertained, management has nevertheless dissolved its relationship with the joint venture and third-party investor to said joint venture, improved its internal controls, voluntarily reported these potential violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice, and has continued to cooperate fully with these agencies regarding these matters.
 
Summary of Significant Recent Accounting Pronouncements
  In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2008, and its adoption did not have a material impact on the results of the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, , which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. FASB Statement No. 157 defines fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB Statement No. 157 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that FASB Statement No. 157 will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Fair Value Measurements
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, . FASB Statement No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under FASB Statement No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31. FASB Statement No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the combined financial statements. The recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 158 were effective at the end of fiscal year 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal year 2009. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FASB Statement No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. The Company recognized a net $7.5 million liability through a reduction in total parent company equity (deficit).
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, , including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. FASB Statement No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. FASB Statement No. 159 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FASB Statement No. 159 will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-11, . EITF Issue No. 06-11 states that an entity should recognize a realized tax benefit associated with dividends on nonvested equity shares, nonvested equity share units, and outstanding equity share options charged to retained earnings as an increase in common stock. The amount recognized in common stock should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. EITF Issue No. 06-11 should be applied prospectively to income tax benefits of dividends on equity-classified, share-based payment awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning on February 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that EITF Issue No. 06-11 will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141R, . FASB Statement No. 141R retains the fundamental requirements in FASB Statement No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which FASB Statement No. 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. FASB Statement No. 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. FASB Statement No. 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that FASB Statement No. 141R will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Business Combinations
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, . This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. FASB Statement No. 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that FASB Statement No. 160 will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
 
In December 2007, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on EITF Issue No 07-1, , which discusses how parties to a collaborative arrangement (which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement) should account for various activities. The consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties (i.e., parties outside of the collaborative arrangement) should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements pursuant to EITF Issue No. 99-19, . Additionally, the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participation in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative pronouncements; analogy to such pronouncements if not within their scope; or a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election. EITF Issue No. 07-1 is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for collaborative arrangements existing as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that EITF Issue No. 07-1 will have on the results of its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND VIES
 
As is common to the industry, the Company executes certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures, including partnership and corporate joint ventures. All debt outstanding for joint ventures is nonrecourse debt. In the event that the joint ventures require additional funding, the Company is obligated under contingent capital calls.
 
The following is a description of certain of the Company's joint ventures, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary:
 
 
The following is a description of the significant unconsolidated joint ventures with 50% or less owned interests for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary:

The following is a description of the unconsolidated joint ventures with greater than 50% owned interests for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary:
 
 
In April 2002, a joint venture was formed to renovate, operate, and maintain an existing water plant for 20 years so as to improve the quality and quantity of treated water supplied by the plant, for which the Company owns a 52% equity interest. The joint venture has a contractual life of 20 years, during which time services for 100% of the plant's output, treated wastewater, are purchased by the Municipality of Tianjin in the People's Republic of China via an exclusive service agreement. As of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, the joint venture had equity earnings of $1.9 million, $1.9 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. The aggregate maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with this joint venture is limited to the equity investment, which is $22.9 million as of September 28, 2007.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
 
In 2004, the Company announced restructuring plans, which included the termination of approximately 315 employees and the closure of 11 facilities, primarily in the United States and Canada. In 2007, the remaining facility reserve for Canada was reversed, as the space was reoccupied by the Company. In 2007, the Company announced restructuring plans, which included the termination of approximately 59 employees and the closure of 2 facilities, primarily in Mexico, Germany, and the United States. Activity for the Company's restructuring reserves is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
As of September 28, 2007, $2.8 million of restructuring reserves remained in the combined balance sheets, of which $2.2 million was included in accrued expenses and $0.6 million was included in other liabilities. These liabilities will be paid through 2009 and consist primarily of facilities exit costs.
The Company recorded restructuring charges (reversals) of $3.7 million, $0, and $(0.3) million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Restructuring charges are recorded in other expenses (income) in the accompanying combined statements of operations.

INCOME TAXES
 
The Company is included within a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, foreign income tax returns, and unitary state income tax returns with certain of the Parent's other subsidiaries. The Company recorded the federal, foreign, and state tax provisions using the separate return method, as if the Company were a separate taxpayer.
 
Significant components of income tax provision (benefit) for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
The reconciliation between U.S. federal income taxes at the statutory rate and the Company's benefit from income taxes on continuing operations for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
Deferred income taxes, of which the net deferred tax asset is included in both other current assets and other assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets, result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax asset as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $15.8 million, $9.7 million, and $7.0 million as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax losses in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 109, ,which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Accounting for Income Taxes
 
The tax losses and credits indicated above were utilized in connection with the various consolidated returns to which the Company is a party and are not available to reduce a tax liability in future periods.
 
The Parent's income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities (see Notes 2 and 9).
 
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across global operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which it is probable that, additional taxes will be due and such amounts are reasonably estimable. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the combined balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year.
 
e income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that an adjustment to increase deferred tax assets in the range of $16 million to $24 million with an offsetting credit to parent company investment is likely. The Company believes that such adjustment will not have a material impact on its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Parent has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2004, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of prior amendments for the periods 1997 to 2004. When the Parent's 2005 and 2006 tax returns are amended additional adjustments may be identified and, while the final adjustments cannot be determined until th
 
The Parent's income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The timing and ultimate resolution of these examinations can be uncertain. The Parent reviews potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Amounts related to potential tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

LEASES
 
The Company leases office and field equipment, vehicles, and buildings under various operating leases. These leases vary in length up to 17 years with limited renewal options. For the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, the Company recognized rental expense of approximately $36.8 million, $39.1 million, and $40.4 million, respectively. These costs were partially offset by sublease income of approximately $0.7 million for September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of September 28, 2007, are as follows (dollars in millions):

INVESTMENTS IN SALES-TYPE LEASES
 
The Company enters into a number of arrangements where the Company is engaged as the primary contractor for the construction of water or wastewater treatment plants or water filtration systems. A number of these assets are financed by the Company for the customer. The lease inception is typically viewed as occurring when the asset construction is complete and control is turned over to the customer. Included in investments in sales-type leases are capitalized interest costs incurred during the construction of the leased assets. Capitalized interest is amortized ratably over the life of the leases, which range from 2 to 20 years in length. Total capitalized interest included in investments in sales-type leases was $0.9 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. The current portion of investments in sales-type leases is included in other current assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
The components of investments in sales-type leases as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
Investments in sales-type leases are interest bearing at rates implicit in the contracts, which approximate fair value. These leases require monthly installment payments over periods ranging generally from 2 to 20 years. Investments in sales-type lease income received for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, was $6.9 million, $5.5 million, and $3.0 million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments (principal and interest) to be received for sales-type leases are as follows (dollars in millions):

Productive assets are depreciated over their useful lives, which range from 10 to 25 years.
 
The Company leases certain of its productive assets to customers under operating leases. These leases range from 10 to 25 years in length. These agreements do not include renewal options. For the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, the Company recognized operating lease income of approximately $74.5 million, $70.0 million, and $64.1 million, respectively. Future amounts receivable under noncancelable operating leases are as follows (dollars in millions):

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to customers on behalf of certain unconsolidated entities, joint ventures, limited partnerships, and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities.
The Company, as part of a consortium with a third-party partner, entered into a DBFO contract to provide water treatment and bulk water supplies to Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland). Tyco and the consortium partner provided performance guarantees that are "joint and several" relating both to construction and to operations to cover construction completion (capped at 60% of construction value); payment of liquidated damages suffered by the consortium in the event of late completion (cap based on 12 months lost revenue reduced by mitigable costs); and performance deficiencies and termination costs during the operating phase (capped at approximately GBP 22.5 million plus UK inflation). The contract covers a period of 25 years from date of signing, with a planned period of approximately 3 years of construction and the remaining 22 years of operations. During the design phase, the maximum potential amount of future payment is capped at GBP 78 million. As of September 28, 2007, the Company has recorded a $0.5 million liability as long-term in other liabilities in the combined balance sheets and corresponding other assets relating to the fair value of this guarantee. In the event of performance under the guarantee, the Company may have recourse to third parties, such as co-ventures, subcontractors, or vendors for claims.
 
  During 2007, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, resolved various claims, disputes, and lawsuits related to its global operations. The resolution of these disputes involved legal expenses and other fees. Among the matters resolved was the settlement of a dispute for $2.3 million with the sellers of two consulting businesses that were previously acquired by the Company. Legal expenses in 2007 totaled $4.1 million and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
Legal Proceedings
 
During 2006, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, resolved various claims, disputes, and lawsuits related to its global operations. The resolution of these disputes involved legal expenses and other fees. Among the matters resolved was a resolution of a dispute with a municipality regarding the performance of a wastewater treatment plant that the Company designed and built and a settlement with a competitor regarding allegations of unfair competition. Legal expenses in 2006 totaled $7.7 million and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
 
During 2005, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, resolved various claims, disputes, and lawsuits related to its global operations. The resolution of these disputes involved legal expenses and other fees. Among the matters resolved included a resolution of alleged design errors by a water district and the district's construction contractor. The Company also incurred legal fees associated with the previously mentioned unfair competition allegations lodged by a competitor. Legal expenses in 2005 totaled $11.8 million and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
 
The Company is also subject to various legal proceedings and other claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, which have not been finally resolved. The Company carries liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, against such claims. However, in some actions, parties are seeking damages that exceed the Company's insurance coverage or for which the Company is not insured. Management does not expect the resolution of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

RETIREMENT PLANS
 
In 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to August 31. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change, as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Company's combined financial statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. Accordingly, all amounts presented as of and for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, reflect an August 31 measurement date, while prior years reflect a September 30 measurement date. The Company has accounted for the change in measurement date as a change in accounting principle. The effects of this change in measurement date did not have a material effect on net periodic benefit costs.
MeasurementDate
 
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, FASB Statement No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Company's combined balance sheets. FASB Statement No. 158 requires recognition of the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FASB Statement No. 158 on September 28, 2007. The Company uses a measurement date of August 31.

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postret
 
The table below presents the incremental effect of applying FASB Statement No. 158 on individual line items in the combined balance sheet at September 28, 2007 (dollars in millions):
 
 
The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations that use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the combined statements of operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
 
 
The net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2007, 2006, and 2005 is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
The estimated net loss and prior service cost for U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.
 
The estimated net loss and prior service credit for non-U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $0.1 million and $0, respectively.
 
The change in benefit obligations, plan assets, and the amounts recognized in the combined balance sheets for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, was $10.7 million, $11.2 million, and $11.9 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for all non-U.S. plans as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, was $78.8 million, $77.1 million, and $65.6 million, respectively.
 
The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $11.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively, as of September 29, 2006, and $11.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2005.
 
The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $4.2 million and $0, respectively, as of September 28, 2007, $74.9 million and $64.1 million, respectively, as of September 29, 2006, and $63.4 million and $51.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2005.
 
The aggregate benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $0 and $0, respectively, as of September 28, 2007, $11.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively, as of September 29, 2006, and $11.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2005.
 
The aggregate benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $91.8 million and $81.3 million, respectively, as of September 28, 2007, $88.9 million and $67.2 million, respectively, as of September 29, 2006, and $76.4 and $53.9, respectively, as of September 20, 2005.
 
In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by its external advisors.
 
The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a superior return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40% allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 89% to equity securities, 8% to debt securities, and 3% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.
 
Pension plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005:
 
 
Although the Company does not buy or sell any Tyco stock as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly hold Tyco stock. The aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.
 
The Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates, as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time to time. The Company anticipates that at a minimum it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal year 2008 of $3.8 million for non-U.S. plans. The Company does not anticipate that a minimum contribution will be required for its U.S. plans.
 
Benefit payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
The Company also participates in a number of multiemployer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. The Company had no pension expense related to these multiemployer plans for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005.
 
The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit-sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $8.2 million, $8.2 million, and $8.1 million, respectively, for each of the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). This plan is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to Internal Revenue Service limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. Expense related to the SERP for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, was not material.
Defined Contribution Retirement Plans 
The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A recordkeeping account is set up for each participant, and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense was $0.9 million, $0.2 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively, and included in the accompanying combined statements of operations. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $8.0 million, $5.2 million, and $4.8 million as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively, included in other liabilities in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
Deferred Compensation Plans 
 
Net periodic postretirement benefit costs for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, were less than $0.1 million, consisting of minimal interest cost and amortization of net actuarial losses, respectively.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
 
 
 
The components of the accrued postretirement benefit obligations, substantially all of which are unfunded, as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, were $0.5 million in all years, primarily due to benefit obligations at the beginning of each year and minimal interest costs, actuarial gains, and benefits paid.
 
 
The Company expects to make contributions to its postretirement benefit plans of less than $0.1 million in 2008.
 
Benefit payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be less than $0.1 million in each year from 2008 to 2012 and $0.3 million for the period 2013 to 2017.
 
For measurement purposes, a 9.7%, 10.1%, and 11.6% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed as of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. The composite annual rate of increase in health care benefit costs was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by the year 2014 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have a minimal effect on total of service and interest cost and postretirement benefit obligation.
 
In December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare ("Medicare Part D"), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Certain of the Company's retiree medical programs already provided prescription drug coverage for retirees over age 65 that were at least as generous as the benefits provided under Medicare. This Act reduces the Company's obligation in these instances. The Company included the effects of the Act in the combined financial statements by reducing net periodic benefit cost by less than $0.1 million for 2005 and reflecting an actuarial gain, which reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $0.1 million as of September 30, 2005.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
Balances due from (to) Tyco and affiliates in the accompanying combined balance sheets are primarily comprised of trade receivables or payables, working capital loans, and intercompany loans associated with the acquisition of both foreign and domestic entities as follows (dollars in millions):
Due From (To) Tyco and Affiliates
 
 
  The Company sells consulting and design-related services to other subsidiaries of Tyco at prices that approximate fair value. Sales to related parties were $5.2 million, $17.3 million, and $12.7 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively.
Sales and Purchases
 
Purchases of materials and services from Tyco-related entities totaled $2.9 million, $4.2 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. These purchases primarily consisted of pipes, valves, and actuators, as well as security and fire suppression systems.
 
  Tyco allocates certain expenses to the Company related to management and administrative services performed on the Company's behalf. Allocations for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, totaled $20.6 million, $16.3 million, and $20.1 million, respectively. These expenses are primarily related to corporate shared services, including treasury, income tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, and risk management functions, and are generally allocated based on the Company's net revenue. Management believes that all allocations are made on a reasonable basis; however, these costs are not necessarily representative of the costs that would have been, or will be, incurred by the Company if it were operating on a stand-alone basis.
Allocation of Expenses
 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Parent sweeps cash from the Company's bank accounts, and the Company maintains certain balances due to or from the Parent. Certain of the advances between the Company and the Parent are interest bearing. The Company had net interest (income) expense on intercompany loans from Tyco of $(14.3) million, $23.0 million, and $19.3 million for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively.
Interest (Income) Expense
 
 The Company engages in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco's Directors serve in either a director or advisor capacity including Bechtel Corporation, The Southern Company and Marsh & McLennan Companies.  Sales transactions included design, operating and maintenance service contracts and environmental remediation services.  Purchases predominantly relate to insurance broker services.
Related-Party Transactions
 
During 2007, sales to companies with these relationships were $1.5 million and purchases were not material.  There were no material balances outstanding as either accounts receivable or accounts payable at September 28, 2007.
 
During 2006, sales to companies with these relationships were $5.1 million and purchases from these companies were $0.6 million.  Accounts receivable outstanding from such parties was $0.7 million and accounts payable to these parties was not material at September 29, 2006.
 
During 2005, sales to companies with these relationships were $0.2 million and purchases from these companies were $0.6 million.  Accounts receivable outstanding from such parties was $0.3 million and accounts payable to these parties was not material at September 30, 2005.

SHARE PLANS
 
As an operating unit of Tyco, the Company has no employee share option plans. As of September 28, 2007, all equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) held by Company employees were granted under the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") or other Tyco equity incentive plans. The 2004 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Tyco, which consists exclusively of independent directors of Tyco and provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, promissory stock, and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards").
 
Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly its Healthcare and Electronics businesses, in the form of a distribution to shareholders (the "Separation"). Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common share. Additionally, on the distribution date, Tyco, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tyco's common shares, at a split ratio of one for four. All share and option data presented has been adjusted to reflect the Separation and reverse stock split.
 
Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Total share-based compensation cost was $ 4.8 million, $3.7 million, and $1.6 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, which has been included in the combined statements of operations within selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements of $1.6 million, $1.3 million, and $0.6 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
Prior to October 1, 2005, Tyco and the Company accounted for share-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123, and, accordingly, did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the date of grant. If Tyco and the Company applied the fair-value-based method prescribed by FASB Statement No. 123 for share options granted by Tyco International to Company employees, the effect on net income would have been as follows (dollars in million):
 
The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the Awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of Tyco's stock and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options. Post- Separation, expected volatility was calculated based on an analysis of historic and implied volatility measures for a set of peer companies. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
 
The weighted-average assumptions Tyco used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average grant-date fair values of Tyco options granted to Company employees during 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $15.22, $14.52, and $17.22, respectively. The total intrinsic value of Tyco options exercised by Company employees during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $2.8 million, $1.1 million, and $1.5 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2006 in the combined statement of cash flow was not material.
 
Options are granted to purchase Tyco common shares at prices that are equal to or greater than the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three or four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.
Share Options
 
 
Share option activity for Company employees under all Tyco plans as of September 28, 2007, and changes during the year then ended is presented below:
 
As of September 28, 2007, there was $2.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested Tyco share options granted to Company employees under Tyco share option plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 2.58 years.
 
Restricted share awards are granted by Tyco subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon normal retirement, death, or disability of the employee.
Restricted Share Awards
 
 
For grants that vest based on certain specified performance criteria of Tyco, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards has been determined based on the market value of Tyco's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest after a period of three or four years, as determined by Tyco's Compensation Committee or upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels of Tyco, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
 
Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents.
 
A summary of the status of Tyco restricted share and performance share awards granted to Company employees as of September 28, 2007, and changes during the year then ended is presented below:
 
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco restricted share and performance share awards granted to Company employees during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $51.07, $45.39, and $54.53, respectively. The total fair value of restricted share and performance share awards vested for Company employees during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $0.3 million, $0.1 million, and $0.0 million, respectively.
 
As of September 28, 2007, there was $4.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested Tyco restricted share awards and performance shares granted to Company employees. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.25 years.
 
Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in Tyco's employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. Tyco matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All of the shares purchased under the plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker.
Employee Stock Purchase Plans
 
 
Tyco also maintains an employee stock purchase plan for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of this plan provide for Tyco to grant Company employees the right to purchase shares of Tyco's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits. Under the Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. All of the shares purchased under the SAYE Plan are purchased on the open market.

DEBT
 
As of September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, the Company's borrowings were comprised of the following (dollars in millions):
 
 
The 3.5% and 3.0% plus Tasa de Inters Interbancaria de Equilibrio (TIIE or the Mexico Interbank Interest Rate) nonrecourse notes, denominated in Mexican pesos, are issued jointly by Banorte and Banobras. The notes are collateralized in full by the assets of the Chihuahua Sur DBFO, an arrangement held by Earth Tech Mexican Holdings, S.A. de C.V. The Company excluded the short-term obligation totaling $11.5 million as of September 30, 2005, from other current liabilities in the accompanying combined balance sheets, as the debt was refinanced during fiscal year 2006 on a long-term basis.
 
The 1.45% plus London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) nonrecourse note, denominated in U.S. dollars, is collateralized in full by dividends paid to a subsidiary of Earth Tech Mexico Holdings, S.A. de C.V. which are held in trust.
 
The Company leases computer equipment under a noncancelable lease agreement, which commenced in 2007 and expires in 2010. Minimum lease rentals have been capitalized and the related assets and obligations were recorded utilizing various interest rates. The assets are amortized using the straight-line method, over the lease term, and interest expense is accrued on the basis of the outstanding lease obligations. Assets acquired under capital leases and accumulated amortization was $0.5 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, as of September 28, 2007.
 
In June 2007, the Company entered into a variable rate, unsecured, uncommitted short-term revolving facility agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to $3.3 million for short-term working capital needs. Interest is determined at the time of borrowing based on the prevailing base lending rate published by the People's Bank of China less a markdown of 10%. Maximum length of time outstanding for each utilization is six months. There are no commitment or facility fees associated with this line of credit. The line of credit had outstanding borrowings of $3.3 million, which is included in other current liabilities in the combined balance sheets, and an interest rate of 5.27% as of September 28, 2007. A maturity schedule for the principal repayment of debt as of September 28, 2007, is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
The above schedule includes minimum lease payments for the capital lease obligation for $0.1, $0.2, and $0.2 due in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
On February 12, 2008, Tyco entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Company in an all cash transaction to AECOM Technology Corporation. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2008.
 
In June 2008, the Company was assessed $1.4 million by the New York Department of Labor in connection with a non-willful violation of local labor law related to a failure to pay prevailing wages. As a result, in June 2008, the Company assigned amounts receivable with a carrying value of $1.4 million as of September 28, 2007, to the New York Department of Labor in satisfaction of the assessment for no consideration.
 
The Company is also a party to a putative class action suit that is derivative of the abovementioned prevailing wage matter. As of September 29, 2007, no amount has been accrued related to the putative class action suit. Management expects the resolution of this matter will have an adverse effect on the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in an amount ranging between $0.4 million to $1.0 million.
 
In June 2008, the Company completed the sale of a water treatment plant and corresponding public works office for $18.1 million. The assets subject to sale had an aggregate carrying value of $15.7 million as of September 28, 2007, and are recorded as productive assets in the combined balance sheets.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Earth Tech (the "Company") is comprised of a number of entities that are affiliated through common ownership (see Note 2). Earth Tech, Inc., the primary U.S. entity, which manages the Earth Tech group, was established in 1970. The Company was subsequently acquired in 1996 by Tyco International, Ltd. ("Tyco" or the "Parent"), a Bermuda company that is publicly traded on the New York and Bermuda stock exchanges.
 
The Company's principal services involve the treatment and handling of water, wastewater, and hazardous waste. The Company also provides infrastructure and transportation design and construction services for institutional, civic, commercial, and industrial customers; design, construction management, project financing, and facility operating services for water and wastewater treatment facilities for municipal and industrial customers; and transportation engineering and consulting. The Company operates through a network of offices in North America, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region and competes with a number of international, national, regional, and local companies on the basis of price and the breadth and quality of services.
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position and results of operations for the periods presented.
 
The results of operations for the nine months ended June 27, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2008.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  The combined financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the following legal entities and their respective 100% owned subsidiaries:
Principles of Combination and Consolidation
 
 
Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
In addition to the legal entities listed above, the combined financial statements include certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows of the consulting and engineering business of Earth Tech Engineering Pty. Limited (an Australian legal entity) and Earth Tech Klartechnik GmbH (German legal entities). These combined financial statements exclude the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows associated with a design/build project within Earth Tech (Infrastructure), 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
 
In June 2008, the Company completed the sale of a water treatment plant and corresponding public works office for $18.1 million. The assets sold had an aggregate carrying value of $15.5 million.
 
The combined financial statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company consolidates variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company bears a majority of the risk related to the entities' potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns and has accordingly determined it is the primary beneficiary. These financial statements present the combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as a subsidiary of the Parent and include allocations of expenses by the Parent and related-party transactions. The combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity. See Note 9 for detail on allocation of expenses.
 
Cash includes cash on hand and cash in banks.
Cash
 
 
The Company participates in the centralized cash management system of Tyco where cash receipts are transferred to and cash disbursements are funded by Tyco, principally on a daily basis. These advances are subject to the terms of various cash management and loan agreements between the Company and the Parent. The amount of cash reported by the Company represents amounts held outside of the cash management system. Negative cash positions at June 27, 2008, of $13.7 million, are classified as other current liabilities in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
On occasion, the Company is required to post cash collateral to secure obligations related to various construction projects and other legal obligations. The amount of associated restricted cash was $4.0 million at June 27, 2008. Such restricted cash is primarily related to international warranty and debt reserve obligations on existing projects or bids for potential projects. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, principally all of the Company's restricted cash is classified as a noncurrent asset, included in other assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
  The Company's principal asset is accounts receivable, and substantially all customers are provided trade credit. At June 27, 2008, approximately 6% of the accounts receivable balance was due from various agencies of the United States government. Concentrations of credit risk associated with the remaining accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of organizations comprising the Company's customer base, their geographic dispersion, and the credit evaluation process.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
The accounts receivable amounts reflected in the accompanying combined balance sheets include billed receivables, unbilled costs, and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Unbilled costs represent costs and amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts in progress as of the date of the combined balance sheets but not yet billed to customers. Such amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of certain milestones, or completion of the project. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.
 
In accordance with the terms of certain long-term contracts, customers may be permitted to withhold between 5% and 10% of such billings until completion and acceptance of the contracts. The amounts withheld are referred to as retentions. Final payment of all such amounts withheld might not be received within a one-year period. As a result, retentions have been included in other assets in the combined balance sheets and comprise $16.0 million net of allowance of $3.6 million as of June 27, 2008. It is not practicable to estimate when the amounts of retainage are expected to be collected.
 
  In determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, the Company must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, included in both other current assets and other assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets, which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
Income Taxes
In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and the forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, the Company develops assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses.
 
The Company currently has recorded significant valuation allowances that it intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. The income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including, but not limited to, any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision.
 
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company's results of combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
 
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across global operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether, and to the extent to which it is probable that, additional taxes will be due and such amounts are reasonably estimable. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition.
 
  The net cash activity associated with the Parent, which includes the activity associated with the cash management system, is recorded as a net capital contribution from or distribution to the Parent in the combined statements of Parent company equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss) and in amounts due from (to) Tyco and affiliates in the combined balance sheets. The net cash activity with the Parent was recorded as a net capital distribution to the Parent and amounted to $41.7 million for the nine months ended June 27, 2008. In addition, the amounts due from (to) Tyco and affiliates include the noncash expenses allocated from the Parent that are discussed in Note 9. Net interest earned or paid on advances between Tyco and the Company is reflected in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
Parent Company Investment and Amounts Due From (To) Tyco and Affiliates
 
  Accrued expenses consist of accrued salaries and wages, vacations, legal and audit fees, insurance, bonus, taxes, and other accruals. Accrued vacations and holidays were $19.0 million at June 27, 2008.
Accrued Expenses
 
  In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2008, and its adoption did not have a material impact on the results of the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Summary of Significant Recent Accounting Pronouncements

INCOME TAXES
 
The Company is included within a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, foreign income tax returns, and unitary state income tax returns with certain of the Parent's other subsidiaries. The Company recorded the federal, foreign, and state tax provisions using the separate return method, as if the Company were a separate taxpayer.
Tax losses and credits are utilized in connection with the various consolidated returns to which the Company is a party and are not available to reduce a tax liability in future periods.
 
The Parent's income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities (see Note 2).  The timing and ultimate resolution of these examinations can be uncertain. The Parent reviews potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on the comprehensive model for recognition and measurement under FIN No. 48. The recognition and measurement in Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes under FIN No. 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the nine months ended June 27, 2008.
 
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across global operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which it is probable that, additional taxes will be due and such amounts are reasonably estimable. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the combined balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year.
 
The Parent has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2004, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of prior amendments for the periods 1997 to 2004. When the Parent's 2005 and 2006 tax returns are amended additional adjustments may be identified and, while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that an adjustment to increase deferred tax assets in the range of $16 million to $24 million with an offsetting credit to parent company investment is likely. The Company believes that such adjustment will not have a material impact on its combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
 
For the quarter ended December 28, 2007 the Company has increased its tax expense as a result of a change in Mexican Tax Law enacted during the quarter. The impact of the change in tax law resulted in the Company increasing the quarter's tax expense by $9.6 million with corresponding decrease in the company's deferred tax assets.

INVESTMENTS IN SALES-TYPE LEASES
 
The Company enters into a number of arrangements where the Company is engaged as the primary contractor for the construction of water or wastewater treatment plants or water filtration systems. A number of these assets are financed by the Company for the customer. The lease inception is typically viewed as occurring when the asset construction is complete and control is turned over to the customer. Included in investments in sales-type leases are capitalized interest costs incurred during the construction of the leased assets. Capitalized interest is amortized ratably over the life of the leases, which range from 2 to 20 years in length. The current portion of investments in sales-type leases is included in other current assets in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
 
The components of investments in sales-type leases as of June 27, 2008 and September 28, 2007, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Investments in sales-type leases are interest bearing at rates implicit in the contracts, which approximate fair value. These leases require monthly installment payments over periods ranging generally from 2 to 20 years. Investments in sales-type lease income received for the nine months ended June 27, 2008 was $5.0 million.

PRODUCTIVE ASSETS
 
Productive assets as of June 27, 2008 and September 28, 2007, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
Productive assets are depreciated over their useful lives, which range from 10 to 25 years.
 
The Company leases certain of its productive assets to customers under operating leases. These leases range from 10 to 25 years in length. These agreements do not include renewal options. For the nine months ended June 27, 2008, the Company recognized operating lease income of approximately $51.8 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to customers on behalf of certain unconsolidated entities, joint ventures, limited partnerships, and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities.
 
The Company, as part of a consortium with a third-party partner, entered into a DBFO contract to provide water treatment and bulk water supplies to Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland). Tyco and the consortium partner provided performance guarantees that are "joint and several" relating both to construction and to operations to cover construction completion (capped at 60% of construction value); payment of liquidated damages suffered by the consortium in the event of late completion (cap based on 12 months lost revenue reduced by mitigable costs); and performance deficiencies and termination costs during the operating phase (capped at approximately GBP 22.5 million plus UK inflation). The contract covers a period of 25 years from date of signing, with a planned period of approximately 3 years of construction and the remaining 22 years of operations. During the design phase, the maximum potential amount of future payment is capped at GBP 78 million. As of September 28, 2007, the Company has recorded a $0.5 million liability as long-term in other liabilities in the combined balance sheets and corresponding other assets relating to the fair value of this guarantee. In the event of performance under the guarantee, the Company may have recourse to third parties, such as co-ventures, subcontractors, or vendors for claims.
 
  During 2008, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, resolved various claims, disputes, and lawsuits related to its global operations. The resolution of these disputes involved legal expenses and other fees.
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is also subject to various legal proceedings and other claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, which have not been finally resolved. The Company carries liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, against such claims. However, in some actions, parties are seeking damages that exceed the Company's insurance coverage or for which the Company is not insured. Management does not expect the resolution of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

RETIREMENT PLANS
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, . FASB Statement No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Company's combined balance sheets. FASB Statement No. 158 requires recognition of the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FASB Statement No. 158 on September 28, 2007. The Company uses a measurement date of August 31.
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 
The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations that use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the combined statements of operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
 
 
The net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and net periodic postretirement benefit cost were not material for the nine months ended June 27, 2008.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
Balances due from (to) Tyco and affiliates in the accompanying combined balance sheets are primarily comprised of trade receivables or payables, working capital loans, and intercompany loans associated with the acquisition of both foreign and domestic entities as follows (dollars in millions):
Due From (To) Tyco and Affiliates
 
 
  The Company sells consulting and design-related services to other subsidiaries of Tyco at prices that approximate fair value. Sales to related parties were $2.0 million for the nine months ended June 27, 2008.
Sales and Purchases
 
Purchases of materials and services from Tyco-related entities totaled $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 27, 2008. These purchases primarily consisted of pipes, valves, and actuators, as well as security and fire suppression systems.
 
  Tyco allocates certain expenses to the Company related to management and administrative services performed on the Company's behalf. Allocations for the nine months ended June 27, 2008, totaled $23.1 million. These expenses are primarily related to corporate shared services, including treasury, income tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, and risk management functions, and are generally allocated based on the Company's net revenue. Management believes that all allocations are made on a reasonable basis; however, these costs are not necessarily representative of the costs that would have been, or will be, incurred by the Company if it were operating on a stand-alone basis.
Allocation of Expenses
 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Parent sweeps cash from the Company's bank accounts, and the Company maintains certain balances due to or from the Parent. Certain of the advances between the Company and the Parent are interest bearing. The Company had net interest income on intercompany loans from Tyco of $8.7 million for the nine months ended June 27, 2008.
Interest (Income) Expense
 
 The Company engages in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco's Directors serve in either a director or advisor capacity including Bechtel Corporation, The Southern Company and Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Related-Party Transactions
 
During 2008, sales to companies with these relationships were $0.7 million and purchases were not material.  There were no material balances outstanding as either accounts receivable or accounts payable at June 27, 2008.

SHARE PLANS
 
As an operating unit of Tyco, the Company has no employee share option plans. As of June 27, 2008, all equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) held by Company employees were granted under the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") or other Tyco equity incentive plans. The 2004 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Tyco, which consists exclusively of independent directors of Tyco and provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, promissory stock, and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards").
 
Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Total share-based compensation cost was $2.6 million for the nine months ended June 27, 2008, which has been included in the combined statements of operations within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
 
Options are granted to purchase Tyco common shares at prices that are equal to or greater than the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three or four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.
Share Options
 
 
Restricted share awards are granted by Tyco subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon normal retirement, death, or disability of the employee.
Restricted Share Awards
 
 
Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents.
 
Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in Tyco's employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. Tyco matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All of the shares purchased under the plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker.
Employee Stock Purchase Plans
 
Tyco also maintains an employee stock purchase plan for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of this plan provide for Tyco to grant Company employees the right to purchase shares of Tyco's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits. Under the Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. All of the shares purchased under the SAYE Plan are purchased on the open market.
 
11.
           
DEBT
 
As of June 27, 2008 and September 28, 2007, the Company's borrowings were comprised of the following (dollars in millions):
 
 
The 3.0% plus Tasa de Inters Interbancaria de Equilibrio (TIIE or the Mexico Interbank Interest Rate) nonrecourse notes, denominated in Mexican pesos, are issued jointly by Banorte and Banobras. The notes are collateralized in full by the assets of the Chihuahua Sur DBFO, an arrangement held by Earth Tech Mexican Holdings, S.A. de C.V.
 
The 1.45% plus London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) nonrecourse note, denominated in U.S. dollars, is collateralized in full by dividends paid to a subsidiary of Earth Tech Mexico Holdings, S.A. de C.V. which are held in trust.
 
In June 2007, the Company entered into a variable rate, unsecured, uncommitted short-term revolving facility agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to $3.6 million for short-term working capital needs. Interest is determined at the time of borrowing based on the prevailing base lending rate published by the People's Bank of China.  Maximum length of time outstanding for each utilization is six months. There are no commitment or facility fees associated with this line of credit. The line of credit had outstanding borrowings of $3.6 million, which is included in other current liabilities in the combined balance sheets, and an interest rate of 6.57% as of June 27, 2008.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
On July 25, 2008, AECOM Technology Corporation ("AECOM") completed its previously announced acquisition of the Company, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of February 11, 2008, by and among AECOM, Tyco International Finance, S.A. and other seller parties thereto.
 
AECOM and Tyco entered into two amendments to the Purchase Agreement, each dated as of July 25, 2008.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement, the parties agreed to exclude the purchase of Tyco's equity participations in certain Company Chinese joint venture operations from the Purchase Agreement and allow those operations to be sold directly by Tyco to third parties.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Purchase Agreement, the parties agreed to, among other things, delay the transfer of the Company's United Kingdom businesses to AECOM until certain third party consents to the transaction are obtained.  Pending receipt of such consents, the parties have agreed for AECOM to manage the U.K. operations.
AECOM also announced that it completed the divestiture of certain Company businesses concurrent with the purchase of the Company.  Concurrent with the close of the purchase of the Company, AECOM divested the Company's Water & Power Technologies and North American Contract Operations businesses and the Company's Mexican operations.  Additionally, AECOM divested the Company's Sweden business in September 2008.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
On July 25, 2008, AECOM Technology Corporation ("AECOM") completed its previously announced acquisition of Earth Tech, Inc. ("Earth Tech"), a business unit of Tyco International Ltd., pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of February 11, 2008, by and among AECOM, Tyco International Finance, S.A. and other seller parties thereto.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2007 and the nine months ended June 30, 2008 are based on the separate historical consolidated financial statements of AECOM and Earth Tech.  These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (the "pro forma financial statements") reflect the acquisition and related events using the purchase method of accounting and apply the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 reflects the acquisition and related events as if they had been consummated on June 30, 2008.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2007 and the nine months ended June 30, 2008 reflect the acquisition and related events as if they had been consummated on October 1, 2006, the beginning of AECOM's 2007 fiscal year.  Earth Tech's fiscal year end was September 28, 2007 and interim period end was June 27, 2008.  For clarity of presentation, such periods are presented consistent with those of AECOM, as September 30, 2007 and June 30, 2008.
 
AECOM and Tyco entered into two amendments to the Purchase Agreement, each dated as of July 25, 2008.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement, the parties agreed to exclude the purchase of Tyco's equity participations in certain Earth Tech Chinese joint venture operations from the Purchase Agreement and allow those operations to be sold directly by Tyco to third parties.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Purchase Agreement, the parties agreed to, among other things, delay the transfer of Earth Tech's United Kingdom businesses to AECOM until certain third party consents to the transaction are obtained.  Pending receipt of such consents, the parties have agreed for AECOM to manage the U.K. operations. The Chinese joint venture operations have been labeled as excluded businesses in the pro forma financial statements.
 
AECOM also announced that it completed the divestiture of certain Company businesses concurrent with the purchase of Earth Tech.  Concurrent with the close of the purchase of the Earth Tech, AECOM divested Earth Tech's Water & Power Technologies and North American Contract Operations businesses and the Company's Mexican operations.  Additionally, in September 2008, AECOM divested Earth Tech's Nordic Water operations based in Sweden.  These businesses have been labeled as businesses sold in the pro forma financial statements.
 
Adjustments to the pro forma financial statements remove balances and results of operations related to the Chinese joint ventures and Earth Tech businesses that were sold subsequent to AECOM's acquisition of Earth Tech, and reclassify certain businesses as discontinued operations based on management's intentions to dispose of such operations within a short period after the close of the Earth Tech transaction.  The total purchase price for Earth Tech, excluding the Earth Tech Chinese joint ventures excluded from the transaction, and net of proceeds from the businesses sold to date, was $326 million. This total purchase price calculation is prior to the final settlement of working capital adjustments between AECOM and Tyco and does not include the proceeds from the future divestitures of the Earth Tech assets being held for sale.  See also information regarding the purchase price allocation in Note 1 to the pro forma financial statements.
 
The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that management believes reasonably reflect the transaction.  We present the pro forma financial statements for informational purposes only.  The pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operations would have been had we completed the acquisition as of the dates indicated.  In addition, the pro forma financial statements do not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company.  You should read this information together with the following:
 
the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements;
                 
 
the separate historical unaudited financial statements of AECOM as of and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 included in AECOM's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008;
                 
 
the separate historical audited financial statements of AECOM as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005 included in AECOM's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2008;
                 
 
the separate historical unaudited combined financial statements of Earth Tech as of and for the nine months ended June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, included as an exhibit in this Form 8-K/A; and
                 
 
 
the separate historical audited combined financial statements of Earth Tech as of and for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005, included as an exhibit in this Form 8-K/A.
                 
 
We prepared the pro forma financial statements using the purchase method of accounting.  Accordingly, the total purchase price of $326 million, net of proceeds from businesses sold to date, is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of Earth Tech acquired, based on their respective fair values.  The allocation is dependent upon valuations and other studies that have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a definitive allocation.  Accordingly, the purchase price allocation pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made using our best judgment given the information currently available solely for the purpose of providing the pro forma financial statements.  The final purchase price allocation and its effect on results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts included in the pro forma financial statements.  These amounts represent management's best estimate as of the date of this Form 8-K/A.
 
In connection with our plan to integrate the operations of AECOM and Earth Tech, we anticipate that non-recurring expenditures will be incurred.  We are not able to determine the timing, nature and amount of these expenditures as of the date of this Form 8-K/A.  However, these expenditures could affect the results of the combined company following the acquisition, in the period in which they are recorded.  The pro forma financial statements do not include the effects of the costs associated with any restructuring or integration activities resulting from the transaction, as they are non-recurring in nature and not factually supportable at the time that the pro forma financial statements were prepared.  In addition, the pro forma financial statements do not include the realization of any cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies resulting from the transaction, nor do they include any potential incremental revenues and earnings that may be achieved with the combined capabilities of the companies.
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (the "pro forma financial statements") have been prepared using the purchase method of accounting with AECOM as the acquiring entity.  Accordingly, under purchase accounting, the acquired and retained assets, liabilities and commitments of Earth Tech are adjusted to their fair values.  Additionally, amounts contained in the historical consolidated financial statements of Earth Tech have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to AECOM's financial statement presentation.
 
The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent management's best estimates based on information available as of the time these pro forma financial statements were prepared and are subject to revision as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.  The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after completion of an analysis to determine the fair values of Earth Tech's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments could differ materially from the preliminary unaudited pro forma adjustments presented herein.
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to Earth Tech's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition.  The total estimated purchase price allocation, net of businesses sold, is as follows:
 
 
Management has not completed the process of determining whether any significant purchase accounting adjustment relating to normal profit on Earth Tech's uncompleted contracts exists.  A normal profit liability or asset is recognized in purchase accounting such that the rate of return reflected in the post-acquisition financial statements of the acquirer is equal to a market return for the acquirer's remaining performance effort under the contract.  Above- or below-market rates of return can occur for a variety of reasons, including: proposing and securing a contract at above or below market profitability levels; cost over- or under-runs primarily on fixed price and lump-sum contracts; changed conditions that cannot be resolved through change orders or claims; and shifts in market prices resulting in higher or lower margins occurring after a particular contract was established.
 
2.  Reclassifications
 
The following reclassifications have been made to conform Earth Tech's historical financial statements to the basis of presentation in the pro forma financial statements:
 
Reclassify Earth Tech's other expense within income from operations to general and administrative expenses to conform to AECOM's presentation.
     
 
Reclassify Earth Tech's minority interest and related tax effects to conform to AECOM's presentation.
     
 
Reclassify certain of Earth Tech's other current assets and other current liabilities, where applicable, to conform to AECOM's presentation.
     
 
3.  Pro Forma Adjustments

LOS ANGELES (November 12, 2008)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008.
 
AECOM reported net income of $43.5 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 40 cents for the fourth quarter.  This represents an increase of 48% over net income of $29.4 million for the same period last year and an increase of 38% over diluted earnings per share of 29 cents for the same period last year.
 
The above diluted EPS from continuing operations excludes 1 cent of earnings per share from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter 2008. Those operations were associated with the non-strategic assets acquired as part of the July 2008 Earth Tech transaction that AECOM has either divested or intends to divest.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue increased to $1.6 billion, 46% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Fourth-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased to $1.0 billion, 51% higher than the same period last year.
 
For the full fiscal year 2008, AECOM reported net income of $147.2 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40.  This represents an increase of 47% over net income of $100.3 million for the same period last year and an increase of 22% over diluted EPS of $1.15 for the same period last year.
 
Revenue for fiscal year 2008 was $5.2 billion  23% higher than fiscal year 2007.   For fiscal year 2008, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 37% to $3.3 billion.
 
"Our results were marked by solid, sustained growth across our practice areas and throughout virtually all our global operations," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "We finished the fiscal year with a number of key wins that reflect the continued demand in the global infrastructure market.  Looking forward, we intend to continue to leverage AECOM's market and geographic diversification to drive organic growth balanced by acquisitive growth that is a hallmark of our business model."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.4 billion and operating income of $90.7 million.  This represents an increase of 51% over revenue of $917.2 million for the same period last year and an increase of 71% over operating income of $52.9 million for the same period last year.  For the full year, the PTS segment reported revenue of $4.3 billion and operating income of $275.2 million.  This represents an increase of 27% over revenue of $3.4 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 52% over operating income of $181.2 million for the same period last year.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 51% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, to $964.1 million.  For the full fiscal year 2008, PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 36% to $3.1 billion.
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the MSS segment reported revenue of $246.7 million and operating income of $6.1 million.  This represents an increase of 25% over revenue of $197.1 million for the same period last year and a decrease of 5% from operating income of $6.5 million for the same period last year.  MSS operating income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by reserves that were established for a pending government contract modification.  For the full year, the MSS segment reported revenue of $866.8 million and operating income of $34.2 million. This represents an increase of 6% over revenue of $818.6 million for the same period last year and an increase of 20% over operating income of $28.6 million for the same period last year.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 52% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, to $45.0 million.  For the full fiscal year 2008, MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 42% to $155.8 million.
 
Balance Sheet
 
As of September 30, 2008, AECOM had $190.0 million of cash, $81.4 million in auction rate securities classified as marketable securities, $391.0 million of debt and $650.0 million in committed bank facilities with over $300 million in unused capacity. In November 2008, AECOM sold its $81.4 million of auction rate securities at par value.
 
Outlook
 
AECOM announced total backlog of $8.6 billion at September 30, 2008, a 43% increase year over year and a 21% increase over the backlog balance at June 30, 2008.
 
"We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations and we are in a solid cash position," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president, chief corporate officer and chief financial officer.  "We have in excess of $300 million of available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and are well positioned to opportunistically invest in organic initiatives as well as strategic acquisitions."
 
Based on the continued strong outlook for the business, AECOM expects diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2009 to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70.
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 11 a.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast on the Internet at www.aecom.com.  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Options granted on or after August 28, 2008 under the AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.
 
TERMS OF OPTION
1.
                                     
 
AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Optionee named in the Term Sheet provided to said Optionee herewith (the "Term Sheet") a non-qualified stock option (the "Option") to purchase up to the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), set forth in Term Sheet, at the purchase price per share and upon the other terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions (as amended from time to time), and the Plan specified in the Term Sheet (the "Plan").  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.
 
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION
2.
                                     
 
The Option is not intended to be an incentive stock Option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly.
 
EXERCISE OF OPTION
3.
                                     
 
The Option shall not be exercisable as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet.  After the Grant Date, to the extent not previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Option shall be exercisable to the extent it becomes vested, as described in the Term Sheet, to purchase up to that number of shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Term Sheet provided that (except as set forth in Section 4) Optionee remains employed with the Company and does not experience a termination of employment.  The vesting period and/or exercisability of the Option shall be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the effects of any period during which the Optionee is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis, provided that no such adjustment may be made which would result in an accounting charge to the Company.
 
To exercise the Option (or any part thereof), Optionee shall deliver a "Notice of Exercise" to the Company specifying the number of whole shares of Common Stock Optionee wishes to purchase and how Optionee's shares of Common Stock should be registered (in Optionee's name only or in Optionee's and Optionee's spouse's names as community property, as joint tenants with right of survivorship, or such other form of
 
 
personal ownership allowed by the Company in the Optionee's locality or state of residence).
 
The exercise price (the "Exercise Price") of the Option is set forth in the Term Sheet.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock until Optionee shall have paid the total Exercise Price for that number of shares of Common Stock.  The Exercise Price may be paid in cash or by certified or cashiers' check.  In addition, the Administrator may permit the Exercise Price to be paid:
 
Broker Assisted: By payment under an arrangement with a broker where payment is made pursuant to an irrevocable commitment by a broker to deliver in the future all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the Option shares to the Company.
A.
                                  
 
Share Tender: By tendering (either physically or by attestation) shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee and having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price but only if such tender will not result in an accounting charge to the Company.
B.
                                    
 
Cashless: By the Company withholding from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Optionee upon the exercise of the Option (or portion thereof) the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a fair market value on the date of exercise sufficient to satisfy the Exercise Price.  If the withheld shares are not sufficient to pay the Exercise Price, the Optionee shall pay to the Company on the date of exercise any amount of the Exercise Price that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above and if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Exercise Price the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Optionee's benefit.
C.
                                    
 
Combination: By any combination of the foregoing or in such other form(s) of consideration as the Administrator (as defined in the Plan) in its discretion shall specify.
D.
                                   
 
Fractional shares may not be exercised.  Shares of Common Stock will be issued as soon as practical after exercise.  Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the exercisability of the Option or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws.
 
EXPIRATION OF OPTION
4.
                                     
 
Except as provided in this Section 4, the Option shall expire and cease to be exercisable as of the Expiration Date set forth in the Term Sheet.  For purposes of the Option, "termination of employment" means ceasing to serve as a full-time employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except that (i) the Administrator may determine, subject to the Plan, that an approved leave of absence or approved employment on a less than full-time basis is not considered a "termination of employment," (ii) the Administrator may
 
determine that a transition of employment to service with a partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party is not considered a "termination of employment,"  and (iii) service as a member of the Board shall constitute continued employment with respect to the Option.
 
Upon the date of a termination of employment for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Company for Cause, (i) any part of the Option that is unexercisable as of such termination date shall remain unexercisable and shall terminate as of such date, and (ii) any part of the Option that is exercisable as of the date of termination shall be exercisable by the Option (or, in the case of the Optionee's death, the Optionee's estate, heir or beneficiary) at any time during the one (1) year following the date of termination and shall terminate at the end of such one (1) year period.
A.
                                  
 
Upon the date of an Optionee's termination of employment for Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised as of the day prior to the date of such termination, shall terminate as of the date of termination.
B.
                                    
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time that the Option would otherwise expire pursuant to this Section 4 (other than in connection with a termination of employment by the Company for Cause), the Optionee is prohibited from exercising the Option because such an exercise would, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, violate applicable securities laws, the period during which the Option may be exercised shall automatically be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days following the first date on which the exercise of the Option would no longer violate applicable securities laws.
 
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OPTION SHARES
5.
                                     
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Optionee or other subsequent transfers by the Optionee of any shares of Common Stock issued as a result of the exercise of the Option, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Optionee and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Optionee will have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Optionee any Shares acquired by the Optionee under the Option.  Any Shares acquired by the Optionee under the Option may not be repurchased by the Company for a
 
period of six (6) months following the date on which the Optionee acquired such Shares pursuant to the Option.
 
Upon the Optionee's termination of employment for any or no reason (including death or disability) at any time prior to the consummation of an underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, any Shares acquired by such Optionee under the Option shall be subject to a right (but not an obligation) of repurchase in favor of the Company.  The Company's right of repurchase with respect to Shares acquired by the Optionee under the Option shall be exercisable during the ninety (90) day period immediately following the later of (i) the date of the Optionee's termination of employment or (ii) 6 months following the date on which the Optionee acquired such Shares pursuant to the Option, in each case, by delivery of written notice to the Optionee (which notice shall set forth a date, within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, on which the repurchase is to be effected).  The Company's right of repurchase with respect to Shares shall lapse upon the consummation of an underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or upon expiration of the above referenced ninety (90) day period.  If the Company exercises its right of repurchase with respect to Shares acquired under the Option it shall pay the Optionee, at the closing of such repurchase, an amount equal to the fair market value of the Shares on the notice date.  At the closing of any repurchase pursuant to this Section 5, the Optionee shall deliver to the Company stock certificates duly endorsed for transfer, or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, representing all of the Shares being sold, free and clear of all claims, liens, or encumbrances from any third parties together with such other documentation as the Company's legal counsel may reasonably require.
 
INCOME TAXES
6.
                                     
 
The Optionee will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on the date (generally, the date of exercise) determined by applicable law, based on the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the portion of the Option that is exercised over the Exercise Price.  The Optionee will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the exercise of the Option, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid over to the applicable tax authorities (the "Tax  Withholding Obligation"), if any.  The Optionee will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Optionee until the Optionee satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation, if any.  The Optionee acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable upon exercise of the Option (or any portion thereof) or from salary or other amounts payable to the Optionee, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, if any.
 
The Optionee is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Optionee in connection with the Option, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 6 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Option. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or exercise of the Option or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee's tax liability.
 
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION
7.
                                     
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Optionee may not assign or transfer the Option to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and the Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee during his or her lifetime.

Exhibit 10.2
 
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Award of restricted stock units granted to an employee of the Company on or after December 1, 2008 under the AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and its amendments (the "Plan"), which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.
 
1.           
TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant named in the Term Sheet provided to said Participant herewith (the "Term Sheet") an award of a number of restricted stock units (the "Award") specified in the Term Sheet.  Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions, and the Plan, each as amended from time to time.  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall, unless the context requires otherwise, include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.
 
2.           
VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet and these Standard Terms and Conditions.  After the Grant Date, subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Award shall become vested as described in the Term Sheet; provided that (except as set forth in Section 5 below) the Participant does not experience a termination of employment (as defined in the Plan).  Each date on which restricted stock units subject to the Award vest is referred to herein as a "Vesting Date."  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Term Sheet to the contrary, if a Vesting Date is not a business day, the applicable portion of the Award shall vest on the prior business day.  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Vested Units."  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that are not vested and remain subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Unvested Units."  The vesting period of the Award may be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the decreased level of employment during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis, provided that the Administrator may take into consideration any accounting consequences to the Company in making any such adjustment.
 
3.           
SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
Subject to any deferral pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 3, each Vested Unit will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan) to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary, during the month following the applicable Vesting Date; provided that the Participant has satisfied all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below, and that the Participant has completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Company deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock.
A.
                                 
 
Subject to the satisfaction all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below, the Administrator may permit the Participant to irrevocably elect to defer the receipt of any Shares issuable pursuant to Vested Units by submitting to the Company an election to defer receipt in the forms provided by the Administrator.  To the extent permitted by the Administrator, in the event the Participant intends to defer the receipt of any Shares, the Participant must submit to the Company a proposed deferral election form by [DATE]. The Participant hereby represents that he or she understands the effect of any such deferral under relevant federal, state and local tax laws.
B.
                                   
 
If the Participant makes a deferred election pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 3, the Participant's Award will be settled by the crediting of one deferred Restricted Stock Unit for each Vested Unit.  Each deferred Restricted Stock Unit will represent one notional share of Common Stock, and will be settled by issuance of one Share for each deferred Restricted Stock Unit (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan).  The terms of the deferral must be specified as part of the advanced irrevocable election, but in no event will provide for the settlement of deferred Restricted Stock Units earlier than the date of distribution that the employee elected.
C.
                                    
 
The date upon which shares of Common Stock are to be issued under either paragraph (A) or (B) of this Section 3 is referred to as the "Settlement Date."  The issuance of the shares of Common Stock hereunder may be affected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant's behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.
D.
                                 
 
Notwithstanding the above, (i) for administrative or other reasons, the Company may from time to time temporarily suspend the issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of Vested Units (or deferred Restricted Stock Units), (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, (iii) the Company may issue shares of Common Stock hereunder subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Company's
 
counsel, are necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, (iv) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters, and (v) shares shall not be issued or issuable pursuant to this provision to the extent of any deferral pursuant to a deferred compensation program that the Company has made available for purposes of allowing deferral of such shares.
 
4.           
RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
 
Prior to any issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of the Award, no shares of Common Stock will be reserved or earmarked for the Participant or the Participant's account nor shall the Participant have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares. The Participant will not be entitled to any privileges of ownership of the shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, any voting or dividend rights) underlying Vested Units and/or Unvested Units unless and until shares of Common Stock are actually delivered to the Participant hereunder.
 
5.           
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
Upon the date of the Participant's termination of employment (as defined in the Plan) for any reason, except as provided in this Section 5, all Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
 
Upon the date of a termination of the Participant's employment as a result of the death of the Participant, the Award will vest on a pro-rata basis and the Vested Units will be paid to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary.  The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Vesting Period and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning of the Vesting Period through the date of termination.  Any Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary.
A.
                                  
 
Upon termination of employment as a result of the Total and Permanent Disablement of any Participant, the Award will vest on a pro-rata basis.  The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Vesting Period and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning of the Vesting Period through the date of termination.  Any Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
B.
                                    
 
Upon termination of employment as a result of the Retirement of a Participant, the Award may vest on a pro-rata basis.  In order to receive prorated vesting, the Participant: (1) must be a solid performer and meet or exceed expectations with respect to the individual performance, etc. (in each case, as determined by the Administrator or any officer of the Company to whom the Administrator's
C.
                                    
 
authority has been delegated) and (2) execute a general release of all claims and abide by a non-solicitation and/or non-competition agreement in a form provided by the Administrator at the time of termination.  The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Vesting Period and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning of the Vesting Period through the date of termination.  Any Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.  For purposes of the Award and these Standard Terms and Conditions, the term "Retirement" means retirement from active employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries at or after age 60 with the approval of the Administrator.  The determination of the Administrator as to an individual's Retirement shall be conclusive on all parties.
 
Upon termination of a Participant's employment for Cause, all Vested Units and Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
D.
                                   
 
6.           
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of Vested Units, including without limitation  (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Participant have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Participant any Shares acquired by the Participant under the Award.  Any Shares acquired by such Participant under the Award may not be repurchased by the Company for a period of six (6) months following the date on which the Participant acquired such Shares pursuant the Award.
 
7.           
INCOME TAXES
 
The Participant will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on a date (generally, the Settlement Date) determined by applicable law (any such date, the "Taxable Date"), based on the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the units that are vested.  The Participant will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the Vested Units, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid to the
 
applicable tax authorities (the "Tax Withholding Obligation").  The Participant will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
By accepting the Award the Participant agrees that, unless and to the extent the Participant has otherwise satisfied the Tax Withholding Obligations in a manner permitted or required by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan, the Company is authorized to withhold from the shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant in respect of Vested Units the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a value (as determined by the Company consistent with any applicable tax requirements) on the Taxable Date or the first trading day before the Taxable Date sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation.  If the withheld shares are not sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above and if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Participant's benefit.
 
Other than with respect to any Tax Withholding Obligation that arises on a date other than a Settlement Date with respect to Vested Units that are subject to a deferred election under paragraph (B) of Section 3, at any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Settlement Date), the Participant may elect to satisfy all or any part of the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient (in light of the uncertainty of the exact amount thereof) to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a personal check payable to the Company, or (iii) such other means as specified from time to time by the Administrator, in each case unless the Company has specified prior to such date that the Participant is not permitted to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable under the Award or from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Participant in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 7 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying Vested Units. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's tax liability.
 
8.           
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Participant may not assign, transfer or pledge the Award, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto or any right or interest therein to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The Company may cancel the Participant's Award if the Participant attempts to assign or transfer it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 8.
 
9.           
THE PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
 
In addition to these Terms and Conditions, the Award shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference. Certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of these Standard Terms and Condition and the Plan, the Plan controls.
 
The Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Award.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Award are superseded.
 
10.         
LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARD
 
Neither the Participant (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Term Sheet or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person in respect of Vested Units.
 
11.         
NOT A CONTRACT FOR EMPLOYMENT.
 
Nothing in the Plan, in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Company's employ or service nor limit in any way the Company's right to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason.
 
12.         
SECTION 409A COMPLIANCE
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, the Plan and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be construed or deemed to be amended as necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the imposition of any additional or accelerated taxes or other penalties under Section 409A of the Code. The Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine the requirements of Section 409A of the Code applicable to the Plan and this Agreement and shall interpret the terms of the Plan and these Standard Terms and Conditions consistently therewith. Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any liability under the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Plan or these Standard Terms
 
and Conditions, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
 
For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred unless such termination is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of these Standard Terms and Conditions, references to a "termination," "termination of employment" or like terms shall mean "separation from service."
 
if the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then, to the extent the settlement of this Award following such termination of employment is considered the payment of deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service" that is not exempt from Section 409A as a short-term deferral (or otherwise), such settlement shall be delayed until the date that is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such "separation from service" or (ii) the date of the Participant's death (the "Delay Period").
In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,

In the event the Participant or other holder of an Award believes that a decision by the Administrator with respect to such person was arbitrary or capricious, the Participant or other holder may request arbitration with respect to such decision in accordance with the terms of the Plan.  The review by the arbitrator shall be limited to determining whether the Administrator's decision was arbitrary or capricious.  This arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive review permitted of the Administrator's decision, and the Participant and any other holder hereby explicitly waive any right to judicial review.
 
19.         
ELECTRONIC DELIVERY
 
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to any awards granted under the Plan by electronic means or to request the Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. By accepting the Award, the Participant consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company, and such consent shall remain in effect throughout the Participant's term of employment or service with the Company and thereafter until withdrawn in writing by the Participant.

Each restricted stock unit subject to this Award represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, subject to the conditions set forth in this Term Sheet, the Plan and the Standard Terms and Conditions.

Exhibit 10.3
 
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Award of Performance Earnings Program ("PEP") units granted to an employee of the Company on or after August 27, 2008 under AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and its amendments (the "Plan"), which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.

AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant named in the Term Sheet (including Attachment A thereto) provided to said Participant herewith (the "Term Sheet") an opportunity to earn a target number of PEP units (the "Award") specified in the Term Sheet.  Each PEP unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions, and the Plan, each as amended from time to time.  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall, unless the context requires otherwise, include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.
 
2.
            
EARNOUT OF PEP UNITS
 
The number of PEP units earned under the Award shall be determined according to the Performance Objectives and Performance Earnout Schedule specified in the Term Sheet.
 
3.
            
VESTING OF PEP UNITS
 
The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet and these Standard Terms and Conditions.  After the Grant Date, subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Award shall become vested as described in the Term Sheet with respect to the number of PEP units earned as set forth in the Term Sheet; provided that (except as set forth in Section 5 below) the Participant does not experience a termination of employment (as defined in the Plan).  Each date on which PEP units subject to the Award vest is referred to herein as a "Vesting Date."  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Term Sheet to the contrary, if a Vesting Date is not a business day, the applicable portion of the Award shall vest on the prior business day.  PEP units granted under the Award that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Vested Units."  PEP units granted under the Award that are not vested and remain subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Unvested Units."  The vesting period of the Award may be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the decreased level of employment during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time
basis, provided that the Administrator may take into consideration any accounting consequences to the Company in making any such adjustment.
 
4.
            
SETTLEMENT OF PEP UNITS
 
Subject to any deferral pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 4, each earned Vested Unit will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan) to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary, during the month following the applicable Vesting Date; provided that the Participant has satisfied all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 8 below, and that the Participant has completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Company deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock.
A.
                                 
 
Subject to the satisfaction all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 8 below, the Administrator may permit the Participant to irrevocably elect to defer the receipt of any Shares issuable pursuant to earned Vested Units by submitting to the Company an election to defer receipt in the forms provided by the Administrator.  To the extent permitted by the Administrator, in the event the Participant intends to defer the receipt of any Shares, the Participant must submit to the Company a proposed deferral election form by [DATE]. The Participant hereby represents that he or she understands the effect of any such deferral under relevant federal, state and local tax laws.
B.
                                   
 
If the Participant makes a deferred election pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 4, the Participant's Award will be settled by the crediting of one deferred Restricted Stock Unit for each earned Vested Unit.  Each deferred Restricted Stock Unit will represent one notional share of Common Stock, and will be settled by issuance of one Share for each deferred Restricted Stock Unit (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan).  The terms of the deferral must be specified as part of the advanced irrevocable election, but in no event will provide for the settlement of deferred Restricted Stock Units earlier than the date of distribution that the employee elected.
C.
                                   
 
The date upon which shares of Common Stock are to be issued under either paragraph (A) or (B) of this Section 4 is referred to as the "Settlement Date."  The issuance of the shares of Common Stock hereunder may be affected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant's behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.

Notwithstanding the above, (i) for administrative or other reasons, the Company may from time to time temporarily suspend the issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of earned Vested Units (or deferred Restricted Stock Units), (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when
the Company determines that the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, (iii) the Company may issue shares of Common Stock hereunder subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Company's counsel, are necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, (iv) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters, and (v) shares shall not be issued or issuable pursuant to this provision to the extent of any deferral pursuant to a deferred compensation program that the Company has made available for purposes of allowing deferral of such shares.

RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
 
Prior to any issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of the Award, no shares of Common Stock will be reserved or earmarked for the Participant or the Participant's account nor shall the Participant have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares. The Participant will not be entitled to any privileges of ownership of the shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, any voting or dividend rights) underlying Vested Units and/or Unvested Units unless and until shares of Common Stock are actually delivered to the Participant hereunder.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
Upon the date of the Participant's termination of employment (as defined in the Plan) for any reason, except as provided in this Section 6, all Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
 
Upon the date of a termination of the Participant's employment as a result of the death of the Participant, the Award will vest on a pro-rata basis and the Vested Units will be paid to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary. The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Performance Cycle and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning date of the Performance Cycle through the date of termination.  Any unearned or Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary.

The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Performance Cycle and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning date of the Performance Cycle through the date of termination. Any unearned or Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
B.
                                   
Upon termination of employment as a result of the Retirement of a Participant, the Award may vest on a pro-rata basis. In order to receive prorated vesting, the Participant: (1) must be a solid performer and meet or exceed expectations with respect to the individual performance, etc. (in each case, as determined by the Administrator or any officer of the Company to whom the Administrator's authority has been delegated) and (2) execute a general release of all claims and abide by a non-solicitation and/or non-competition agreement in a form provided by the Administrator at the time of termination.  The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Performance Cycle and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning date of the Performance Cycle through the date of termination. Distributions may be the lesser of actual performance or 100% of the pro-rated PEP units.  Any unearned or Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.  For purposes of the Award and these Standard Terms and Conditions, the term "Retirement" means retirement from active employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) at or after age 60 and with the approval of the Administrator or (ii) at or after age 65.  The determination of the Administrator as to an individual's Retirement shall be conclusive on all parties.

CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of Vested Units, including without limitation  (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Participant have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Participant any Shares acquired by the Participant under the Award.  Any Shares acquired by such Participant under the Award may not be repurchased by the Company for a period of six (6) months following the date on which the Participant acquired such Shares pursuant the Award.
8.
            
INCOME TAXES
 
The Participant will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on a date (generally, the Settlement Date) determined by applicable law (any such date, the "Taxable Date"), based on the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the units that are vested and earned.  The Participant will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the Vested Units, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid to the applicable tax authorities (the "Tax Withholding Obligation").  The Participant will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
By accepting the Award the Participant agrees that, unless and to the extent the Participant has otherwise satisfied the Tax Withholding Obligations in a manner permitted or required by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan, the Company is authorized to withhold from the shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant in respect of Vested Units the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a value (as determined by the Company consistent with any applicable tax requirements) on the Taxable Date or the first trading day before the Taxable Date sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation.  If the withheld shares are not sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above and if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Participant's benefit.
 
Other than with respect to any Tax Withholding Obligation that arises on a date other than a Settlement Date with respect to Vested Units that are subject to a deferred election under paragraph (B) of Section 4, at any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Settlement Date), the Participant may elect to satisfy all or any part of the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient (in light of the uncertainty of the exact amount thereof) to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a personal check payable to the Company, or (iii) such other means as specified from time to time by the Administrator, in each case unless the Company has specified prior to such date that the Participant is not permitted to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable under the Award or from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
The Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Participant in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 8 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying Vested Units. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's tax liability.
 
9.
            
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Participant may not assign, transfer or pledge the Award, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto or any right or interest therein to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The Company may cancel the Participant's Award if the Participant attempts to assign or transfer it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 9.
 
10.
          
THE PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
 
In addition to these Terms and Conditions, the Award shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference. Certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of these Standard Terms and Condition and the Plan, the Plan controls.
 
The Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Award.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Award are superseded.
 
11.
          
LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARD
 
Neither the Participant (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Term Sheet or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person in respect of Vested Units.
 
12.
          
NOT A CONTRACT FOR EMPLOYMENT.
 
Nothing in the Plan, in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Company's employ or service nor limit in any way the Company's right to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason.
13.
          
SECTION 409A COMPLIANCE
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, the Plan and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be construed or deemed to be amended as necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the imposition of any additional or accelerated taxes or other penalties under Section 409A of the Code. The Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine the requirements of Section 409A of the Code applicable to the Plan and this Agreement and shall interpret the terms of the Plan and these Standard Terms and Conditions consistently therewith. Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any liability under the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
 
For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred unless such termination is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of these Standard Terms and Conditions, references to a "termination," "termination of employment" or like terms shall mean "separation from service."
 
if the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then, to the extent the settlement of this Award following such termination of employment is considered the payment of deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service" that is not exempt from Section 409A as a short-term deferral (or otherwise), such settlement shall be delayed until the date that is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such "separation from service" or (ii) the date of the Participant's death (the "Delay Period").
In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
 
14.
          
NOTICES
 
All notices, requests, demands and other communications pursuant to these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if personally delivered, telexed or telecopied to, or, if mailed, when received by, the other party at the following addresses (or at such other address as shall be given in writing by either party to the other):

The review by the arbitrator shall be limited to determining whether the Administrator's decision was arbitrary or capricious.  This arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive review permitted of the Administrator's decision, and the Participant and any other holder hereby explicitly waive any right to judicial review.

 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, which ended December 31, 2008.
LOS ANGELES (February 10, 2009)
 
AECOM reported net income of $40.5 million for the first quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents.  These results represent an increase of 37% over net income of $29.5 million  and an increase of 31% over diluted EPS of 29 cents  for the same period last year.  The net income amount does not include $0.4 million of earnings from discontinued operations associated with non-strategic assets acquired as part of the 2008 Earth Tech transaction, which AECOM intends to divest.  Operating income for the first quarter increased 57% year over year to $69.7 million.
 
First-quarter revenue increased to $1.5 billion, 35% higher than the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  AECOM's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 32% compared to the same period last year, to $889.5 million.
 
 
 
"Our solid first-quarter results reflect the benefits of AECOM's diversified global business model," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "During the quarter, we continued to expand our business in spite of a slowing demand in some of our commercial and private facilities markets.  Overall, we saw continued strength and growth in our U.S. businesses as well as our non-U.S. operations. Looking forward, we believe that AECOM is well positioned to benefit from the implementation of stimulus programs around the world."
 
"We saw continued demand for our services globally throughout the infrastructure market, and this was reflected in our backlog growth during the quarter," said Dionisio.  "Projects such as our work in support of Zayed University's new campus in Abu Dhabi, major transit expansions in San Francisco and Toronto, and five task order wins for the U.S. Air Force's Contract Field Teams program, highlight the breadth and diversification of our success."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.2 billion and operating income of $76.9 million, compared to revenue of $893.4 million and operating income of $53.4 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 38% increase in revenue and a 44% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 30% to $846 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the MSS segment reported revenue of $223 million and operating income of $10.0 million, compared to revenue of $187 million and operating income of $3.4 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 19% increase in revenue and a 194% increase in operating income year over year.  The year over year comparison for MSS is positively impacted by an adjustment in the corresponding period last year that lowered award fees.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 60% to $43 million.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $9.0 billion at December 31, 2008, a 32% increase year over year.
 
 
"We continued to effectively execute our growth strategy across our end markets and geographies during the first quarter," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.
 
"Our continued positive trends in margin improvement, where we saw a 107-basis-point improvement,   and backlog growth, where we achieved a $2.2-billion increase in our year-over-year backlog, indicate continued solid momentum in our global end markets."
 
Outlook
 
Based on its results through the first quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has reaffirmed its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2009 of $1.60 to $1.70.
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 11 a.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.

If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Time of Sale Prospectus is delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(e)

Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter
7.
                                      
Covenants of the Underwriters
 
  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or

Indemnity and Contribution.
investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
 
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(b)
                                
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel,
(c)
                                 
indemnified party
indemnifying party
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release and no admission of fault of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses,
(d)
                                
claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnified party or parties on the one hand and the indemnifying party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnified party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnifying party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall
(e)
                                 
pro rata
be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
(f)
                                   
 
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by written notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9.
                                      
Termination
 
.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
10.
                                
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that
provided
any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
.  (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Shares, represents the entire agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Shares.
11.
                                
Entire Agreement
 
The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Shares: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the
(b)
                                
Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Shares.
 
.  This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
12.
                                
Counterparts
 
.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

Adoption of Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives
 
The Board of Directors of AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") has adopted a Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives (the "Policy").

If a qualifying termination occurs within eighteen months following or within ninety days prior to a change in control, the terminated executive is entitled to a lump sum cash severance payment (equal to a multiple of the executive's base salary and average bonus over the three years prior to termination), full vesting acceleration of all equity awards and continued health coverage, as outlined in the Policy.

Section 1.
Introduction
                                         
 
This AECOM Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives (the "") is effective as of March 5, 2009 (the "").  The compensation and benefits payable under the Policy are payable in connection with certain Change in Control events that occur after the Effective Date.  The purpose of the Policy is to provide for the payment of severance benefits to certain key executives of AECOM Technology Corporation (the "") or one of its subsidiaries in connection with a Change in Control.  The Policy will be in lieu of and not in addition to any severance benefit arrangement, change of control severance agreement or employment agreement that provides for severance benefits in existence between the Eligible Individual (as defined below) and the Company (or any subsidiary), notwithstanding the terms of any such arrangement or agreement, and no benefits will be paid under the Policy to any Eligible Individual unless such Eligible Individual agrees to forgo any payments or benefits under such other arrangement or agreement.  The Policy is intended to be an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily to provide severance compensation and benefits to a select group of "management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301, and 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Policy to the contrary, except as otherwise required by applicable law with respect to Eligible Individuals employed outside of the United States, any amounts payable to an Eligible Individual under the Policy will be reduced (but not below zero) by any payments by the Company to such individual under any other policy, plan, program or arrangement, including, without limitation, any change of control severance agreement or employment agreement between the Eligible Individual and the Company that provides for severance benefits in existence, or any contract between the Eligible Individual and any entity, to the extent such payments are conditioned, at least in part, on termination of employment and are based on the Eligible Individual's continued receipt of his or her Base Salary and/or annual bonus opportunity.  Furthermore, to the extent that any federal, state or local laws, including, without limitation, so-called "plant closing" laws, require the Company to give advance notice or make a payment of any kind to an Eligible Individual because of that Eligible Individual's involuntary termination due to a layoff, reduction in force, plant or facility closing, sale of business, change of control, or any other similar event or reason, the benefits payable under the Policy will either be reduced or eliminated.  The benefits provided under the Policy are intended to satisfy any and all statutory obligations that may arise out of an Eligible Individual's involuntary termination of employment for the foregoing reasons, and the Administrator will so construe and implement the terms of the Policy.
(a)
Certain Reductions and Offsets.
                                 
 
  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Eligible Individual will not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided under the Policy by seeking other employment or other form of remuneration for services, nor will the amount of any payment provided for under the Policy be reduced by any compensation earned by any Eligible Individual as a result of employment by another employer or any retirement benefits received by such Eligible Individual after his or her Involuntary Termination.
(b)
Mitigation.
                                 
 
  Benefits under the Policy will terminate immediately if the Eligible Individual, at any time, violates any proprietary information or confidentiality obligation to the Company or any obligations under the Policy.
(c)
Termination of Benefits.
                                 
 
  No Eligible Individual is eligible to receive benefits under the Policy more than one time.
(d)
Non-Duplication of Benefits.
                                 
 
  If the Eligible Individual is indebted to the Company or an affiliate of the Company at his or her Termination Date, the Company reserves the right to offset any severance payments under the Policy by the amount of such indebtedness.

(f)
Excise Taxes.
                                   
 
In the event that any benefits payable to an Eligible Individual pursuant to the Policy () (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this Section 5(f) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any comparable successor provisions (the ), then the Eligible Individual's Payments hereunder shall be either (a) provided to the Eligible Individual in full, or (b) provided to the Eligible Individual as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax, and any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by the Eligible Individual, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under the Excise Tax.  Unless the Company and the Eligible Individual otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5(f) shall be made in writing in good faith by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company (the ).  In the event that the payments and/or benefits are to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5(f), such payments and benefits shall be reduced such that the reduction of compensation to be provided to Eligible Individual as a result of this Section 5(f) is minimized.  In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A (as defined below) and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero.  For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5(f), the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code, and other applicable legal authority.  The Company and the applicable Eligible Individual shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 5(f).  The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5(f).

If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 5(f), the IRS determines that an Eligible Individual is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any Payments, then the Eligible Individual shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) days after a final IRS determination or in the event that the Eligible Individual challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Payments equal to the . The Repayment Amount shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that the Eligible Individual's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on such benefits) shall be maximized.

The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in the Eligible Individual's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Payments being maximized.  If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 5(f), the Eligible Individual shall pay the Excise Tax.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(f), if (A) there is a reduction in the payment of the Payments to an Eligible Individual as described in this Section 5(f), (B) the IRS later determines that the Eligible Individual is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of the Eligible Individual's net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if the Eligible Individual's benefits had not previously been reduced), and (C) the Eligible Individual pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to the Eligible Individual those Payments which were reduced pursuant to this Section 5(f) as soon as administratively possible after the Eligible Individual pays the Excise Tax so that the Eligible Individual's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of the Payments are maximized.

Section 409A

(ii)
                               
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that an Eligible Individual is a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit (whether under this Policy or otherwise) that is considered deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service," and that is not exempt from Section 409A as involuntary separation pay or a short-term deferral (or otherwise), such payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such "separation from service" of the Eligible Individual or (B) the date of the Eligible Individual's death (the "").  Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 5(g) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Eligible Individual in a lump sum without interest, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Policy shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.

 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, which ended March 31, 2009.
LOS ANGELES (May 7, 2009)
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $43 million for the second quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents.  These results represent an increase of 20% over net income from continuing operations of $36 million  and an increase of 14% over diluted EPS of 35 cents  for the same period last year.  The net income amount does not include $0.4 million of earnings from discontinued operations associated with non-strategic assets acquired as part of the 2008 Earth Tech transaction, which AECOM intends to divest. Operating income for the second quarter increased 20% year over year to $71 million.  For the first six months of fiscal year 2009, AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $84 million and operating income of $140 million, an increase of 28% and 36%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
Second-quarter revenue increased to $1.5 billion, 29% higher than the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.
 
AECOM's second quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 29% compared to the same period last year, to $1.0 billion.  For the first six months of fiscal 2009, AECOM reported revenue of $3.0 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs of $1.9 billion, an increase of 32% and 30%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"The strength of AECOM's diversified global business model is reflected in our solid second-quarter results," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "Overall, we saw continued strength across our end markets.  Our ability to expand client relationships and collaborate across our operations around the globe contributed to the continued growth of our business.
 
"During the second quarter, we won a number of significant projects," said Dionisio. "Mega projects such as Crossrail in the United Kingdom, the largest civil infrastructure project in Europe; the New Central Wan Chai Bypass in Hong Kong; and two California High-Speed Rail projects highlighted a quarter that also included key wins in India, the Middle East and Bangladesh."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.2 billion and operating income of $79 million, compared to revenue of $1.0 billion and operating income of $61 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 30% increase in revenue and a 31% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 27% year over year to $899 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, the MSS segment reported revenue of $258 million and operating income of $15 million, compared to revenue of $209 million and operating income of $14 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 24% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in operating income year over year.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 67% year over year to $67 million.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $9.2 billion at March 31, 2009, a 30% increase year over year.
"During the second quarter, we continued to effectively execute our growth strategy across our end markets and geographies," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "Continued positive trends in margin improvement, where we saw a 24-basis-point improvement, and backlog growth, where we achieved a $2.1 billion increase in our year-over-year backlog, point to AECOM's continued solid momentum in our global end markets."
 
Outlook
 
Based on its results through the second quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has reaffirmed its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2009 of $1.60 to $1.70. "Looking ahead, we believe that AECOM will continue to see growth and is well positioned to benefit from continued spending on infrastructure projects around the globe," said Burke. "As such, we feel confident that our results will be in the upper half of the range."

On May 28, 2009, the Compensation/Organization Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") approved a revision to the outstanding Performance Earnings Program ("PEP") awards previously granted to Francis S.Y. Bong, Chairman Asia and a member of the Company's Board of Directors, to reflect his move from full-time to part-time employment status that commenced on April 1, 2009 and Mr. Bong's continued contributions to the Company.  The revision affects PEP awards made to Mr. Bong for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009.  For each of these awards, Mr. Bong received an award of performance-based restricted stock units that may be earned based on the Company's financial performance and his continued employment over a three-fiscal year performance period.
 
As revised, Mr. Bong will receive fifty percent of the value of the portion of the PEP awards for the period beginning April 1, 2009 to the end of each applicable performance period.  The value of the portions of the PEP awards to which Mr. Bong may be entitled for performance periods prior to April 1, 2009 have not been changed.  In addition, the financial performance criteria to which the PEP awards are subject have not been changed.

LOS ANGELES (August 6, 2009)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, which ended June 30, 2009.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $50 million for the third quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents.  These results represent an increase of 30% over net income from continuing operations of $38 million  and an increase of 22% over diluted EPS of 37 cents  for the same period last year.  The net income amount does not include $1.2 million of earnings from discontinued operations associated with non-strategic assets acquired as part of the 2008 Earth Tech transaction, which AECOM intends to divest. Operating income for the third quarter increased 14% year over year to $73 million.  For the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $133 million and operating income of $212 million, an increase of 28% and 26%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
 
Third-quarter revenue increased to $1.5 billion, 16% higher than the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.
 
AECOM's third-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 13% compared to the same period last year, to $1.0 billion.   For the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, AECOM reported revenue of $4.5 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs of $2.8 billion, an increase of 25% and 24%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"AECOM's ability to maintain continued growth across our end markets reflects our strong diversified business model," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "Overall, we saw continued solid performance across our geographies.  Our ability to expand client relationships and collaborate across our operations around the globe contributed to a successful third quarter."
 
"During the quarter, we won several significant projects," said Dionisio.  "Mega projects, such as the Trans-Hudson Express tunnel final design in the United States and the Hong Kong High-Speed Rail Terminus, as well as  several large infrastructure-development projects throughout the Middle East, highlighted the quarter."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.2 billion and operating income of $80 million, compared to revenue of $1.1 billion and operating income of $70 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 14% increase in both revenue and operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 10% year over year to $894 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, the MSS segment reported revenue of $286 million and operating income of $13 million, compared to revenue of $224 million and operating income of $11 million for the same period during fiscal year 2008.  This represents a 28% increase in revenue and a 23% increase in operating income year over year.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 69% year over year to $74 million.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $9.2 billion at June 30, 2009, a 30% increase year over year.
"We continued to execute our growth strategy and cost-containment initiatives during the quarter," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "Continued margin improvement and a $2.1-billion increase in our backlog over last year position AECOM well in our global end markets."
 
Outlook
 
Based on its results through the third quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has raised its EPS outlook range for fiscal year 2009 to $1.65 to $1.70.  "Looking ahead, we believe that AECOM will continue to see growth and is well positioned to benefit from continued spending on infrastructure projects around the globe," said Burke.

Manager within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any out of pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Manager furnished to the Company in writing by the Manager expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
                                
The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers, and  each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any out of pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act, or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Manager furnished to the Company in writing by the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)
                                 
If any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) (each, a "") shall be instituted involving  any person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Manager (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing and the  indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party shall retain counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such Proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such Proceeding.  In any such Proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any
Proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnified party in connection with any Proceeding or related Proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Manager and all persons, if any, who control the Manager within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of the Manager within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Manager and such control persons and affiliates of the Manager, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability, by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this Section 7(c), the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60  days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release and no admission of fault of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.
 
(d)
                                
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) and (b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnified party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnifying party or parties, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnified party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnifying parties or party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting
 
discounts and commissions received by the Manager, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Manager, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Manager and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating  or defending any Proceeding.
 
(e)
                                 
The Company and the Manager agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Item 5.03               Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On August 27, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws").  The Bylaws amendments were intended to make improvements to corporate governance and to update several provisions related to recent developments in Delaware corporate law.  The amendments included the following items:
 
                 
Articles II and III of the Bylaws were amended to update the procedures for shareholder nominations for director and shareholder proposals to provide, among other things, that (i) the advance notice provisions apply to all stockholder proposals and director nominations and (ii) stockholders must disclose fully all ownership interests, including derivatives, hedges, and other economic and voting interests.
 
                 
Article V was amended to provide that the right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses to directors and officers granted under the Bylaws cannot be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to the Bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that gives rise to the proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.
 
                 
Article VI, Section 6.5 was amended to allow the Board the flexibility to set one record date for notice of a stockholder meeting and the option to set a second record date for voting that is closer to the date of the meeting than the record date for notice of the meeting in accordance with a recent change in Delaware law.
 
The Board also made certain other technical and conforming amendments to the Bylaws, including the deletion of Section 6.10, which contained provisions regarding the transfer of securities which by their terms are no longer applicable subsequent to the Company's initial public offering in May 2007.
 
The Bylaws are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Exhibit.

Annual Meetings

(a)
                                 
An annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other proper business as may come before such meeting shall be held during each fiscal year of the Corporation at such time, date and place, if any, as the Board shall determine by resolution.  At an annual meeting of the stockholders, the only business which shall be conducted and the only nominations of persons for election as directors which shall be considered are those that shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, business other than nomination of a candidate for election as a director must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.2 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.  The procedures for the proper nomination of a candidate for election as a director are set forth in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws.
 
(b)
                                
For business other than nominations to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) above, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business must otherwise be a proper subject for action by stockholders of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the Corporation by the close of business, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than thirty (30 days) after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received no more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the date of the annual meeting and not less than the later of the close of business (1) ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting and (2) on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement (as defined below) of the date of the annual meeting was first made by the Corporation.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (other than the nomination of a candidate for election as a director, which is governed by Section 3.3 of these Bylaws):
 
(i)
                                    
a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at such meeting, and the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws of the Corporation, the text of the proposed amendment);
 
(ii)

(iii)
                              
as to the stockholder giving the notice or, if the notice is given on behalf of a beneficial owner on whose behalf the business is being proposed, as to such beneficial owner, (A) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation's capital stock which are beneficially owned (as defined below) by such stockholder or beneficial owner as of the date of the notice, (B) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the business being proposed between such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person, including without limitation any agreements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D (regardless of whether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable to the stockholder or beneficial owner) of the Exchange Act, and (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of the Corporation's capital stock, or maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, and, in the case of each of clauses (A), (B) and (C), the stockholders' agreement to supplement such information in writing not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting by providing to the Corporation information about any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.2(c));

(v)

(c)
                                 
Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.2(b) to the contrary, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.2 shall set forth the stockholder's agreement to supplement such information in writing not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, or by the opening of business on the date of the meeting (whichever is earlier), of the information required under clauses (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of this Section 2.2, and such information when provided to the Corporation shall be current as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
(d)
                                
Section 2.2(b) shall not apply to a proposal to be made by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present the proposal at an annual or special meeting only pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or any other rule promulgated under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and such proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such meeting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under this Section 2.2 within the time frames specified by this Section 2.2 or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.  For purposes of this Section 2.2(e), to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the making of such proposal at such meeting by such stockholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
 
(f)
                                   
For purposes of these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable news service or in a document publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(b) of the Exchange Act, and the meaning of the term "group" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.  For purposes of clause (b)(iii)(A) of this Section 2.2, shares shall be treated as "beneficially owned" by a person if the person beneficially owns such shares, directly or indirectly, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulations 13D and 13G thereunder or has or shares pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing): (A) the right to acquire such shares (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or the fulfillment of a condition or both), (B) the right to vote such shares, alone or in concert with others and/or (C) investment power with respect to such shares, including the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, such shares.
Section 2.3

.  Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board, or by a committee of the Board which has been duly designated by the Board and whose powers and authority, as expressly provided in a resolution of the Board, include the power to call such meetings, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.  Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.
 
Section 2.4
                                     
Stockholder Lists
.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of tenth day before the meeting date.  Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order and shall show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal executive office of the Corporation.  If the meeting is to be held in person then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 2.4 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.5
                                     
Notice of Meetings
.  Notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting has been called, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.6
                                     
Quorum and Adjournment
.  The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for holding all meetings of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by applicable law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum (or such greater vote as may be required by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws).  If it shall appear that such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present or represented.  Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

Voting
.  At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, when a quorum is present, a plurality of the votes of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors at such meeting of stockholders shall be sufficient to elect.  In all other matters, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter at such meeting of stockholders shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of applicable law or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.  Such vote may be by voice vote or by written ballot; provided, however, that no vote at any meeting of stockholders need be by written ballot unless the Board, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at the meeting, in his or her discretion, specifically directs the use of a written ballot.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders shall be entitled to one vote (in person or by proxy) for each share of the capital stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize in writing another person or persons to act for such holder by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period of time for which it is to continue in force.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date.

Right of Claimant to Bring Suit

If a claim under Section 5.1 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30)days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to receive an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has failed to meet such standard of conduct.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
 
Section 5.3
            
Non-Exclusivity of Rights

Nature of Rights
.

Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article V that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.
 
Section 5.6
            
Settlement of Claims
.

Section 5.7
            
Subrogation
.

Section 6.1
            
Seal
.  It shall not be necessary to the validity of any instrument executed by any authorized officer or officers of the Corporation that the execution of such instrument be evidenced by the corporate seal, and all documents, instruments, contracts and writings of all kinds signed on behalf of the Corporation by any authorized officer or officers shall be as effectual and binding on the Corporation without the corporate seal, as if the execution of the same had been evidenced by affixing the corporate seal thereto.  The Board may give general authority to any officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by signature.

Stock Certificates; Uncertificated Shares
.  The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates; provided that the Board may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.  Any or all of the signatures on any stock certificates may be a facsimile signature.  If any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of the issuance.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
.  The Board may direct a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued and that is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of the fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed.  When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance, require the owner of such certificate or certificates, or such person's legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate.
 
Section 6.5

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.  If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.  If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.
 
(b)
          
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action.  If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Fiscal Year
.  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board.

Any Bylaws adopted, amended or altered by the stockholders may be amended, altered or repealed by the Board or the stockholders.
 
Section 6.9
            
Waiver of Notice
.  Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to the notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

LOS ANGELES (November 12, 2009)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended September 30, 2009.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $54 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 48 cents for the fourth quarter.  This represents an increase of 27% over net income of $43 million for the same period last year and an increase of 20% over diluted earnings per share of 40 cents for the same period last year.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, 0.2% lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Fourth-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $989 million, 2% lower than the same period last year.
 
For the full fiscal year 2009, AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $187 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.70.  This represents an increase of 27% over net income of $147 million for the same period last year and an increase of 21% over diluted EPS of $1.41 for the same period last year.
 
The above diluted EPS from continuing operations exclude earnings per share from discontinued operations.  The discontinued operations were associated with the non-strategic assets acquired as part of the July 2008 Earth Tech transaction that AECOM has either divested or intends to divest.
 
 
Revenue for fiscal year 2009 was $6.1 billion  18% higher than fiscal year 2008.  For fiscal year 2009, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 16% to $3.8 billion.
 
"Our strong performance, in spite of economic pressures, reflects the success of our diversified business model as well as our ability to leverage AECOM's global network of expertise to expand client relationships," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.
 
"During the quarter, we won over $1.8 billion in new projects, highlighted by several mega projects," Dionisio said.  "These wins, coupled with three recently announced acquisitions, make AECOM well positioned for continued success."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of $91 million.  This represents a decrease of 3.6% from revenue of $1.4 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 1% over operating income of $90 million for the same period last year.  For the full year, the PTS segment reported revenue of $5.1 billion and operating income of $325 million.  This represents an increase of 17% over revenue of $4.3 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 18% over operating income of $275 million for the same period last year.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, decreased 5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, to $921 million.  For the full fiscal year 2009, PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 14% to $3.6 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, the MSS segment reported revenue of $292 million and operating income of $10 million.  This represents an increase of 18% over revenue of $247 million for the same period last year and an increase of 64% from operating income of $6 million for the same period last year.  For the full year, the MSS segment reported revenue of $1.1 billion and operating income of $48 million.  This represents an increase of 22% over revenue of $867 million for the same period last year and an increase of 41% over operating income of $34 million for the same period last year.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 51% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, to $68 million.  For the full fiscal year 2009, MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 61% to $251 million.
 
Balance Sheet
 
As of September 30, 2009, AECOM had $287 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $169 million of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with over $470 million in unused capacity.  Cash flow from operations increased by 38% to $217 million for the year ended September 30, 2009.
Outlook
 
AECOM announced total backlog of $9.5 billion at September 30, 2009, a 10% increase year over year and a 3% increase over the backlog balance at June 30, 2009.
 
"Our record backlog of $9.5 billion speaks to our ability to grow our book of business in a challenging market," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "Additionally, our strong execution against our margin improvement initiatives, and our strong balance sheet, position AECOM well for fiscal year 2010."
 
Based on the continued strong outlook for the business, AECOM expects diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2010 to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.00.  The midpoint of this range reflects 15% growth in earnings per share.
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 11 a.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast at www.aecom.com.  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

LOS ANGELES (Feb. 9, 2010)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended Dec. 31, 2009.
 
AECOM reported net income of $46 million for the first quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents.  These results represent an increase of 12% over net income of $41 million  and an increase of 5% over diluted EPS of 38 cents  for the same period last year.
 
Operating income for the first quarter decreased 5% year over year to $65 million due to $8.2 million of one-time charges associated with a severance charge in the United Kingdom and marketing and branding expenses related to AECOM's first-quarter global brand launch. These are non-recurring charges and AECOM remains on track to achieve its 20-basis-point annual EBITDA margin improvement in fiscal year 2010.
 
First-quarter revenue increased to $1.5 billion, 2% higher than the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.
 
AECOM's first-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased to $1.0 billion, 8% higher than the same period last year.
 
"AECOM saw continued strength across its markets in the first quarter," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "Our operations in North America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East were particularly solid, as was our U.S. Federal Government business, where we are pursuing nearly $15 billion of new work."
 
"AECOM's diversified business model and its strength in key end markets, such as transportation and facilities, have positioned us to capitalize on stimulus-related opportunities in 2010 and beyond," noted Dionisio.
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.20 billion and operating income of $74 million, compared to revenue of $1.23 billion and operating income of $76 million for the same period during fiscal year 2009.  This represents a 2% decrease in revenue and a 3% decrease in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 4% year over year to $884 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the MSS segment reported revenue of $276 million and operating income of $13 million, compared to revenue of $223 million and operating income of $10 million for the same period during fiscal year 2009.  This represents a 24% increase in revenue and a 34% increase in operating income year over year.  MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 82% year over year to $78 million.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $10.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, an 11% increase year over year.
 
"During the first quarter of 2010, we continued to successfully execute our growth strategy across our end markets and geographies," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "We are seeing encouraging trends, including more than $750 million in wins in the month of January alone.  These wins position AECOM for continued growth in our global end markets."
 
Balance Sheet
 
AECOM has a strong balance sheet to fund growth. At Dec. 31, 2009,the company had $253 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $187 million of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with over $470 million in unused capacity.
 
Outlook
 
Based on its results through the first quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has reaffirmed its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2010 of $1.90 to $2.00.  "Looking ahead, we believe that AECOM is well positioned to benefit from stimulus spending on infrastructure as well as from the overall economic recovery," said Burke.  "As such, we remain confident in our guidance for the full year."
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call on Tuesday, Feb. 9, at 11 a.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.

AECOM reported net income of $59 million for the second quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 51 cents.  These results represent an increase of 39% over net income of $42 million  and an increase of 31% over diluted EPS of 39 cents for the same period last year.  Operating income for the second quarter increased to $83 million, 21% higher than the same period last year.

Second-quarter revenue increased to $1.6 billion, 7% higher than the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.

For the first six months of fiscal 2010, AECOM reported revenue of $3.1 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs of $2.0 billion, an increase of 4% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"We continued to win new work across our diversified end markets and geographies in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer. "
Our global transportation and U.S. federal government markets  as well as our business in global markets such as Hong Kong, China, Australia and Eastern Europe  performed particularly well.
Our pipeline of new opportunities is solid and we continue to anticipate accelerated growth in the second half of the year."

This represents a 6% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 7% year over year to $966 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, the MSS segment reported revenue of $284 million and operating income of $14 million, compared to revenue of $258 million and operating income of $15 million for the same period during fiscal year 2009.

Outlook
 
"Our continued strong execution in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 resulted in a 39% year-over-year increase in net income," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Based on our results through the second quarter of the fiscal year, and our outlook for accelerated growth in the second half of the year, we are raising our EPS guidance range for fiscal year 2010 to $1.97 to $2.05
 which at the midpoint of the range, represents annual growth of 18%."

For avoidance of doubt, the Deductible shall not apply to claims for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnitees (or any of them) with respect to breaches of the covenants or agreements of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement.
"Deductible"
 
Section 9.3            .  From and after the Closing Date, to the extent provided in this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to indemnify, jointly and severally, Sellers and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents  ("") against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitees to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or undertaking of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (iii) all Post-Closing Taxes, (iv) except with respect to any matter for which Buyer is indemnified under Section 9.2, the operation of the Acquired Companies and its Business from and after the Closing Date, (v) subject to Section 3.18, the WARN Act (or any similar foreign, state or local Law),
Indemnification by Buyer
Seller Indemnitees
to the extent any mass layoff or termination, as defined by the WARN Act, is commenced or otherwise initiated after the Closing and authorized by Buyer; provided said indemnification obligation does not inure directly to the benefit of any individual or group of employees, officers, or agents of the Acquired Companies, or (vi) subject to Section 3.18, any claims for severance or other termination benefits asserted against Sellers or their Affiliates by any employee of any Acquired Company who is terminated from and after the Closing, except for such terminations that were commenced or otherwise initiated prior to the Closing by written notice of termination given to the employee (whether subject to the expiration of a notice period or otherwise); provided, that, for avoidance of doubt,
any claims for severance by any such employees shall, as between the Acquired Companies, Buyer and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and such employees, on the other hand, be governed by the applicable severance agreements or policies of Buyer in effect at the time of termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for (A) those portions of any Losses that represent lost profits, diminution in value, restitution, mental or emotional distress, exemplary, consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages except to the extent that any of the same are paid by a Seller Indemnitee to a third party in connection with a claim asserted by such third party; or (B) those portions of any Losses (i) that are reimbursed from insurance proceeds actually received and retained, or (ii) that have arisen as a result of any act or omission by any Seller or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date.
 
Section 9.4            .  Any liability for indemnification under this Article IX shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the set of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking, or one or more rights to indemnification, including any matter for which any reserve or accrual has been established in the Financial Statements or in the books and records of the Acquired Companies in accordance with GAAP.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any fact, event or circumstance which results in an adjustment to the purchase price pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof would also constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any of a Party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement or otherwise result in a Loss to the other Party, such Party shall have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such breach or inaccuracy to the extent that (i) recovery for any such Loss would constitute a duplicative payment of amounts recovered as a purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, or (ii) such Loss was reflected as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet.
Single Recovery
 
Section 9.5            .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6 (Purchase Price Adjustment), Section 2.8 (GLS Related Payments), or Section 11.17 (Specific Performance), Parent, Buyer and Sellers each acknowledge and agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims relating to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings contained in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX.  In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, Buyer and Sellers hereby waive, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights of rescission with respect to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
Exclusive Remedy
 
Section 9.6            Indemnification Procedures.
 
(a)           If a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeks to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 (other than in respect of a third party claim, action or proceeding referred to in Section 9.6(b)) (the ""), the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice of such claim to the Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is sought with respect thereto (collectively, an ""), setting forth the nature of the claim and the basis for indemnification hereunder (to the extent known to the Indemnified Party).
Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
 
(b)           If, following the Closing, any claim is asserted or action or proceeding commenced or threatened by a third party against an Indemnified Party that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification by such Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 (each, a ), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such asserted, commenced or threatened Third-Party Proceeding and the basis for indemnification thereunder (to the extent known to the Indemnified Party).  The failure to provide such notice as provided herein will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure adversely prejudices in any significant respect the Indemnifying Party hereunder.  The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding giving rise such claim for indemnification at such Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense, and, at its option (and its sole cost and expense), shall be entitled to assume and control the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense, and shall diligently and in good faith prosecute such Third-Party Proceeding to a final conclusion or settlement (subject to the applicable limitations on settlement set forth in this Section 9.6).  As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of such asserted, commenced or threatened Proceeding), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to participate in, or, at its election, assume and control, the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding.  The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding (but shall not be entitled to control such defense, if the Indemnifying Party has timely notified the Indemnified Party of its election to assume and control such defense) and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose; that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, unless, in the Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on the advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because of a conflict or potential conflict between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, in which case the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, to participate in such defense with respect to such matters as to which such conflict exists.  If the Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense of any such Third-Party Proceeding in accordance with this Section 9.6(b), the Indemnified Party agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to (and, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to provide access to all relevant documents and records and to make all relevant personnel available to) the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding.  If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding in accordance with this Section 9.6(b), (i) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge, with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article IX for any judgment, settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Proceeding made by the Indemnified Party not made in accordance with clause (i) above.  If the Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense of any such Third-Party Proceeding in accordance with this Section 9.6(b), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge, with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding; that the Indemnifying
"Third-Party Proceeding"
provided, however,
provided however,
Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, before approving any judgment with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding, or entering into any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Proceeding, if (i) pursuant to, or as a result of, such judgment, settlement or compromise, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) such judgment, settlement or compromise does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding (other than solely with respect to the Deductible (to the extent such liabilities would constitute Losses to which the Deductible would be applicable in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 9.2 or Section 9.3) in which case the amount thereof shall be deemed applied to the satisfaction of such Deductible), (iii) such judgment, settlement, compromise or discharge contains or involves (x) an admission or statement providing for or acknowledging any criminal wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (y) the debarment or suspension by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from being awarded future Government Contracts, or (iv) if the Indemnifying Party consists of one or both of the Sellers, the then-remaining Escrow Funds shall be insufficient to satisfy any liabilities resulting from such judgment, settlement, compromise or discharge (unless the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to be responsible for satisfying any such liabilities, to the extent the then-remaining Escrow Funds shall be insufficient for such purpose).
 
(c)           .  Each Loss which an Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced (i) by any amounts actually recovered and retained by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for such Loss (it being understood that each Indemnified Party shall be required to use its Best Efforts to pursue all available insurance recoveries in connection with any indemnification claim hereunder), and (ii) to take account of any reduction of net Taxes actually realized by the Indemnified Party as a direct result of such Loss (determined after properly taking into account the actual and reasonably anticipated effect on (including increase of) Taxes (including future Taxes) of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof as a result of any indemnification amount paid or payable for such Loss under this Article IX). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Loss or obtains any reduction of net Taxes, in each case, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.
Adjustments for Insurance and Taxes
 
(d)             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the aggregate liability of Sellers in respect of all claims for indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, and the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under this Agreement in respect thereof, at any time shall in no event exceed the Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow Account and all claims for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, pursuant to this Article IX shall be asserted solely against the Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and such Escrow Funds shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery for
Recovery for Claims for Indemnification.
the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, for any amounts owing to them pursuant to this Article IX.  Upon the Final Determination of any amount of Losses to which any Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, Buyer and Sellers shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such amount from the then-remaining Escrow Funds in the Escrow Amount in accordance with the separate written payment instructions of the Buyer Indemnitee.
 
(e)           Each Indemnified Party shall use its Best Efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that an Indemnified Party asserts or may assert under this Article IX.  In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to use its Best Efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Sellers nor Buyer, as the case may be, shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had used such Best Efforts.
Mitigation. 
 
(f)            .  Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have against any other persons with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require to perfect such subrogation or to pursue such rights against such other persons as the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have.
Subrogation
 
(g)           .  Any indemnification payment made by a Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder and no party shall take any position inconsistent with such characterization.
Treatment of Indemnity Claims

(e)           by Sellers or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final non-appealable Order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; it being agreed that the Parties hereto shall promptly appeal any adverse determination which is appealable (and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence); , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to a Party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party or Parties to perform any of its or their obligations under this Agreement; or
provided, however
 
(f)            by Sellers or Buyer if any event shall occur after the date hereof that shall have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the obligations of the terminating Party or Parties to perform its or their obligations hereunder, unless the occurrence of such event shall be due to the failure of the terminating Party or Parties to perform or comply with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by such Party or Parties prior to the Closing.
 
Section 10.2          .  In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AECOM to acquire McNeil Technolgies in US$355-million transaction
 
U.S. federal government services firm expands AECOM's presence in the U.S. intelligence market
 
LOS ANGELES (Aug. 4, 2010)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that it has agreed to acquire McNeil Technologies, Inc., a leading government national security and intelligence services firm based in Springfield, Va., from the private equity firm Veritas Capital.
 
"Our acquisition of McNeil Technologies expands AECOM's U.S. government business and advances our strategy of positioning AECOM to participate in fast-growing markets," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "McNeil brings a unique expertise to AECOM in intelligence, information technology and cyber security  and diversifies our strong base of federal government relationships.  As the federal government continues to reprioritize spending, national security will be high on the list.  Combined with our recent acquisition of SSI, AECOM now has a significant presence in this high-growth market  and we are well positioned to capture new growth opportunities."
 
Under the terms of the agreement, stockholders of McNeil will receive cash of US$355 million.  AECOM expects the transaction to be accretive to cash earnings per share (EPS) in fiscal year 2011.  On a GAAP basis, the transaction is expected to be neutral to EPS in fiscal year 2011.
 
McNeil has approximately 1,500 employees and provides mission-critical services to U.S. federal government clients in the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and other U.S. federal and municipal agencies.  Many of these clients already entrust the success of other aspects of their critical missions to AECOM.  McNeil will lead AECOM's national security and intelligence programs.
 
"McNeil generated approximately US$245 million of revenue in the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, and has a history of strong cash flow and profitability," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "We are pleased to be in a position to put our balance sheet to work to fund strategic acquisitions in today's highly attractive M&A market.  We look forward to working with McNeil to expand our market position in national intelligence."
 
Ronald Thomas, McNeil chief executive officer, said "The federal government's continued focus on funding national security initiatives is driving long-term growth opportunities for McNeil.  AECOM is the ideal partner to help McNeil capitalize on these opportunities, given their strong reputation and presence in the government market sector.  We are excited about the new possibilities that joining AECOM presents for our employees as well as our clients."
 
 
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of AECOM's fiscal year 2010.  The acquisition has been approved by Veritas Capital and is subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory approvals.
 
AECOM will discuss this transaction and other company developments on its earnings conference call on Aug. 5, 2010.  More information is available online at http://investors.aecom.com.

LOS ANGELES (Aug. 5, 2010)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended June 30, 2010.
 
AECOM reported net income of $65 million for the third quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 56 cents.  These results represent an increase of 30% over net income of $50 million  and an increase of 24% over diluted EPS of 45 cents  for the same period last year.  Operating income for the third quarter increased to $93 million, 26% higher than the same period last year.  For year-to-date fiscal year 2010, AECOM reported net income of $169 million and operating income of $242 million, an increase of 28% and 14%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
Third-quarter revenue increased to $1.6 billion, 6% higher than the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.
 
AECOM's third-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased to $1.1 billion, 9% higher than the same period last year. For year-to-date fiscal year 2010, AECOM reported revenue of $4.7 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs of $3.1 billion, an increase of 5% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"Our efforts to leverage AECOM's market and geographic diversification  as well as a growth model that balances organic and acquisitive growth  have served us well, as we continue to deliver industry-leading performance," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.
 
"The trajectory of our organic growth, which improved five percentage points over the second quarter, combined with the four acquisitions that we have announced since May reflect our ability to execute our growth strategy.  Our acquisitions of INOCSA; Tishman and Davis Langdon; and McNeil Technologies strengthen our positions in high speed rail, turnkey construction services and intelligence services for the U.S. government, respectively  all high-growth, higher-margin markets," Dionisio said.  "In total, these acquisitions are expected to add approximately $1.7 billion in annual gross revenue and 5,800 employees to our growing enterprise."
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.34 billion and operating income of $108 million, compared to revenue of $1.26 billion and operating income of $81 million for the same period during fiscal year 2009.  This represents a 7% increase in revenue and a 34% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 8% year over year to $1.0 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, the MSS segment reported revenue of $297 million and operating income of $13 million, compared to revenue of $286 million and operating income of $13 million for the same period during fiscal year 2009.  This represents a 4% increase in revenue and a 2% decrease in operating income year over year.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $9.7 billion at June 30, 2010, a 4% increase year over year.
 
Balance Sheet
 
At June 30, 2010, the company had $294 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $189 million of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with $439 million in unused capacity.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the company announced the issuance of $250 million of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
 
Outlook
 
"During the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, we continued to execute our growth strategy, resulting in a 30% year-over-year increase in net income," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Our PTS wins during the quarter improved by $250 million and our MSS opportunities remain strong, with nearly $7 billion of proposals currently under evaluation.  Based on our results through the third quarter of the fiscal year, we are maintaining our EPS guidance for fiscal year 2010 in the range of $1.97 to $2.05  which at the midpoint of the range, represents annual growth of 18%."
 
AECOM is hosting a conference call on Aug. 5, 2010, at 11 a.m. EDT, during which management will make a brief presentation on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.  Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast at www.aecom.com.  The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

Item 1.01.
                                       
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 16, 2010, AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $600 million in term loans on the closing date and may borrow up to an additional $100 million in term loans upon request by the Company subject to certain conditions. The Company used approximately $450 million of the proceeds of the loans to pay down indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and other short term indebtedness and a portion of the proceeds to pay fees and expenses related to the Credit Agreement. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions.
 
The loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 1.0% to 2.25% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is a range of 2.0% to 3.25%, both based on the debt-to-earnings leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter. The initial interest rate of the loans borrowed on September 16 is the 3 month Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5%, or a total of 2.79%.
 
Payments of the initial principal amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement are required on a quarterly basis beginning on September 30, 2012. Any remaining principal of the loans under the Credit Agreement is due no later than September 16, 2014. Accrued interest is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis for Base Rate loans, and at the end of the applicable interest period (but at least every three months) for Eurodollar Rate loans. The Company may optionally prepay the loans at any time, without penalty.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that have the effect of limiting under certain circumstances the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge with other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a change in control, create new liens, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business, enter into transactions with affiliates, or substantially change the general nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios.

Exhibit 99.1
September 22, 2010
 
AECOM is transitioning recordkeeping and additional participant support services for the AECOM Retirement & Savings Plan ("") and the AECOM Contract Employee 401(k) Plan from Fidelity Investments to Merrill Lynch.
RSP
 
As part of this transition, there will be a period of time during which plan participants will not be able to make any changes to their accounts or conduct any transactions under the plans, including transactions with respect to AECOM stock held in their accounts.  Specifically, all purchases, sales and distributions of AECOM common stock under the RSP will be temporarily suspended effective at 3:00 pm (Eastern Standard Time) on October 22, 2010 and are not scheduled to resume until 8:00 am (Eastern Standard Time) on November 8, 2010 (this period is referred to as the "").
blackout period
 
Please note that the blackout period described in this notice occurs during the regular quarterly blackout period under AECOM's insider trading policy and will have no additional effect on your ability to trade in AECOM stock.
 
Under Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as a result of the blackout described above, you will not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer equity securities of AECOM (or derivative securities of those equity securities, such as stock options) during the blackout period.  This prohibition also applies to any direct or indirect pecuniary interest you may have in such securities, such as AECOM stock held by immediate family members living with you, or held in trust, or by controlled partnerships or corporations.
any
 
The prohibition on sales and other transfers applies only to equity securities of AECOM (and derivatives of such securities) that you have acquired in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer of AECOM.  It is important to note that any such security you sell or otherwise transfer will be automatically treated as acquired in connection with your service or employment unless you establish that the securities were acquired from another source and this identification is consistent with your treatment of the securities for tax purposes and all other disclosure and reporting requirements.
 
Importantly, there is an exception to the prohibition on purchases, sales and other acquisitions or transfers described above for Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Any purchase or sale of equity securities of AECOM pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan will be exempt from the prohibitions described above; provided that you did not enter into or modify the plan during the blackout period, or while you were aware of the actual or approximate beginning or ending dates of that blackout period.
 
If you engage in a transaction that violates the restrictions described above, you may be required to disgorge your profits from the transaction and you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.  The SEC regulations regarding blackout period restrictions are complex.  To avoid any inadvertent violations of the blackout period restrictions, you are required to follow AECOM's pre-clearance procedures in connection with any proposed transaction in AECOM securities during the blackout period.  In addition, during this blackout period the trading restrictions under AECOM's insider trading policy continue to apply.
 
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this notice, the blackout period or the restrictions described herein, please contact David Gan at (213) 593-8038 or Preston Hopson at (213) 593-7754.

LOS ANGELES (Nov. 11, 2010)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2010.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $68 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 58 cents for the fourth quarter.  This represents an increase of 25% over net income of $54 million for the same period last year and an increase of 21% over diluted earnings per share of 48 cents for the same period last year.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, a 12% increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Fourth-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.1 billion, representing a 14% increase over the same period last year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, for the fourth quarter increased 3.8% year over year.
 
For the full fiscal year 2010, AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $237 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.05.  This represents an increase of 27% over net income of $187 million for the same period last year and an increase of 21% over diluted EPS of $1.70 for the same period last year.
 
For fiscal year 2010, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 10% to $4.2 billion, while gross revenue for fiscal year 2010 was $6.5 billion  7% higher than fiscal year 2009.
 
"2010 was a year of many noteworthy achievements for AECOM," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer. "We furthered our strategy of diversification with the completion of five strategic acquisitions, and we continued to win work on the most prestigious projects around the world.
 
"During the fourth quarter, we won more than $2 billion in new work across our geographies and end markets," Dionisio said. "We are poised for continued forward momentum in 2011 and beyond with our balanced business model, global platform of integrated services and focus on high growth end markets and geographies."
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.5 billion and operating income of $120 million.  This represents an increase of 15% from revenue of $1.3 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 32% over operating income of $91 million for the same period last year.  For the full year, the PTS segment reported revenue of $5.4 billion and operating income of $399 million.  This represents an increase of 7% over revenue of $5.1 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 23% over operating income of $325 million for the same period last year.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 11% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, to $1.0 billion.  For the full fiscal year 2010, PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 8% to $3.8 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the MSS segment reported revenue of $294 million and operating income of $12 million.  Revenues were unchanged from the same period last year, while operating income increased 17% from $10 million in the same period last year.  For the full year, the MSS segment reported revenue of $1.2 billion and operating income of $52 million.  This represents an increase of 9% over revenue of $1.1 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 8% over operating income of $48 million for the same period last year.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 50% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, to $105 million.  For the full fiscal year 2010, MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 45% to $366 million.
 
Balance Sheet
 
As of Sept. 30, 2010, AECOM had $613 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $931 million of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with $542 million in unused capacity.  Cash flow from operations decreased by 31% to $159 million for the year ended Sept. 30, 2010.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced total backlog of $14.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, a 55% increase year over year and a 52% increase over the backlog balance at June 30, 2010.  Excluding backlog obtained through acquisitions, total backlog increased 4% over the backlog balance at June 30, 2010.
 
Outlook
 
"Our solid execution in FY10 resulted in year-over-year earnings growth of 21%," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "We closed the year with improving organic growth, increased operating margins, record backlog of $14.7 billion, and a strong balance sheet to fund future growth.  We are excited about the opportunities that we see ahead for AECOM as we complete the integration of our recent acquisitions and continue to pursue new opportunities around the globe."
 
Based on the strength of its diversified business model, AECOM expects diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2011 to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30.

 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, which ended Dec. 31, 2010.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $57 million for the first quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 48 cents for the first quarter.  This represents an increase of 25% over net income from continuing operations of $46 million and an increase of 20% over diluted earnings per share of 40 cents for the same period last year.
 
First-quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, a 31% increase from the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure and excludes such pass-through costs, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.
 
First-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.2 billion, representing a 26% increase over the same period last year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, for the first quarter increased 7% year over year.  Organic revenue excludes revenue from companies acquired in the last 12 months.
 
"We saw strong organic-growth improvements in both revenue and backlog during the first quarter," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "Growth was driven primarily by AECOM's increasing presence in high-growth, emerging markets and economies that export natural resources.
 
"We are poised for continued, strong performance as we capitalize on new organic-growth opportunities, drive revenue synergies from recent acquisitions and seize new opportunities created through increased cross-selling and the anticipated growth of alternative delivery procurement and public-private partnerships," Dionisio said.
 
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion and operating income of $92 million.  This represents an increase of 31% from revenue of $1.2 billion for the same period last year and an increase of 24% over operating income of $74 million for the same period last year.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 23% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 to $1.1 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the MSS segment reported revenue of $360 million and operating income of $22 million.  This represents an increase of 30% from revenue of $276 million for the same period last year and an increase of 62% over operating income of $13 million for the same period last year.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 64% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, to $129 million.
 
Balance Sheet
 
As of Dec. 31, 2010, AECOM had $421 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt with $600 million in committed bank facilities that have $269 million in unused capacity.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog of $15.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, a 55% increase year over year.
 
Outlook
 
"Fiscal year 2011 is off to a solid start, said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "Our results for the quarter were positively impacted by continued improvement to our EBITDA margins  a 77-basis point improvement during the first quarter  driven by continued efficiencies and growth in higher-margin services.
 
"Together with improved organic growth and backlog, these results point to an improving business environment and give us confidence in our fiscal year 2011 outlook," Burke said.
 
Based on its results through the first quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has raised its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011 to $2.25 to $2.35.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AECOM completes withdrawal of expatriate employees from Libya; Fiscal Year 2011 guidance remains unchanged
 
LOS ANGELES
(March 1, 2011)  AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that it has completed the safe withdrawal of its expatriate employees and their families from Libya.
 
"The safety and security of our staff is paramount to AECOM, and we are grateful for the safe withdrawal of our expatriate personnel," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.
 
Since 2008, AECOM has been the program manager for the Libya Housing and Infrastructure Board's program to modernize the country's infrastructure.  Due to the current uncertainty in Libya, the company cannot determine when or if this project will continue.
 
"We currently estimate that this business disruption will result in a reduction of EPS of $.08 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, primarily due to demobilization, shutdown, and operating impacts.  However, our full-year 2011 guidance range remains unchanged at $2.25 to $2.35, due to continued strength in the remainder of our business," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "As a global company with operations in over 100 countries around the world, our diversified business model reduces our exposure to any one geography or single project."

LOS ANGELES (May 5, 2011)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which ended March 31, 2011.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $58 million for the second quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 49 cents for the second quarter. This represents a decrease of 2% from net income from continuing operations of $59 million and a decrease of 4% from diluted earnings per share of 51 cents for the same period last year.  During the quarter, the company ceased its operations in Libya, which had a negative $0.08 EPS impact.  Operating income for the second quarter increased to $87 million, 5% higher than the same period last year.
 
Second-quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, a 21% increase from the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Second-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.3 billion, representing a 23% increase over the same period last year.  Excluding the impact of Libya, organic revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 4% year over year.
 
For the first six months of fiscal year 2011, AECOM reported net income of $115 million and operating income of $178 million, an increase of 10% and 19%, respectively, compared to the same period last year, despite the negative impact from Libya.  For the first six months of fiscal 2011, AECOM reported revenue of $3.9 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $2.5 billion, an increase of 26% and 24%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"We saw continued organic growth, both in revenue and backlog, during the second quarter," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "We are pleased that we were able to achieve solid results even with challenging external events, which we believe speaks to the resilience of our diversified business model and to the agility of our team around the world."
 
"We are poised for continued strong performance as we capitalize on organic-growth opportunities around the world and drive revenue and cost synergies from recent acquisitions.  With the fiscal year 2011 federal budget now in place, we expect to see a meaningful increase in our U.S. government business during the second half of the year," Dionisio said.
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion and operating income of $92 million.  This represents an increase of 25% from revenue of $1.3 billion for the same period last year and a decrease of 6% from operating income of $97 million for the same period last year.  The company's withdrawal from Libya negatively impacted PTS segment results.
 
PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 19% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, to $1.1 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, the MSS segment reported revenue of $291 million and operating income of $19 million.  Revenues increased by 2% from the same period last year, while operating income increased 39% from $14 million in the same period last year.
 
MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 73% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, to $149 million.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
 
As of March 31, 2011, AECOM had $403 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with $338 million in unused capacity.  Cash flow from operations totaled $33 million in the quarter, an $85-million improvement from the prior year.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog of $15.4 billion at March 31, 2011, a 56% increase year over year.  Organically, backlog increased by 6% year over year and 10% excluding Libya.
 
Outlook
 
"Our significant organic backlog growth and increase in cash flow point to continued improvements in our markets," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.
 
"An improving global business environment and our exposure to high-growth emerging and natural resource-rich markets, provide us with confidence to increase our guidance for fiscal year 2011," Burke said.
 
Based on its results through the second quarter of the fiscal year, as well as its backlog, AECOM has raised its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011 to $2.35-$2.40.  In addition, the company expects that Q3 earnings will contribute approximately one quarter of the full year's earnings.
AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 10 a.m. ET, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the company's results, strategies and operating trends.

Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 20, 2011, AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders").
 
The Credit Agreement, which replaces the Company's prior credit agreement set to expire in 2012, increases the available borrowing capacity under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.05 billion from $600 million, and expires on July 20, 2016.  The Company may, at its option, also increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement up to an additional $100 million subject to receipt of additional lending commitments for such loans and other customary conditions.
 
The loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin.   The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.0% to 1.50% based on the leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter and the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is a range of 1.0% to 2.50% based on the leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter.
 
Prior to the maturity date, the principal amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed at the option of the Company without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.  The principal amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement and any accrued and unpaid interest is due no later than the maturity date of July 20, 2016.   Accrued interest with respect to such principal amounts is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis for Base Rate loans, and at the end of the applicable interest period but at most every three months for Eurodollar Rate loans.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that have the effect of limiting under certain circumstances the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge with other entities, create new liens, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business, pay dividends or make other payments with respect to the Company's capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, or substantially change the general nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios.
 
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries pursuant to a subsidiary guaranty. The loans under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.
 
Events of default (subject to certain cure periods and other limitations) under the Credit Agreement are customary and include but are not limited to (i) non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts due under the Credit Agreement, (ii) the violation of terms, covenants, representations or warranties in the Credit Agreement or related loan documents, (iii) any event of default under agreements governing certain indebtedness of the Company, including the Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined below), and certain defaults by the Company or any subsidiary with respect to indebtedness exceeding 3.0% of the Company's net worth , (iv) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation involving the Company or certain subsidiaries (v) judgments in excess of 3.0% of the Company's net worth or which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the Company, and (vi) the occurrence of an ERISA Event (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in liability of the Company in excess of 3% of the Company's net worth.
The descriptions set forth above are qualified in their entirety by the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Bank of America, N.A. the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, also is the administrative agent under that certain Credit Agreement dated as of September 16, 2010 (the "Term Loan Credit Facility"), and certain lenders under the Credit Agreement also are lenders under the Term Loan Credit Facility.  The Company and its affiliates maintain various commercial and service relationships with the Lenders and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business.  In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Lenders and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking, financial advisory or other services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have in the past and/or may in the future receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.

Each Lender shall deliver to the Company and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made by the respective Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the respective Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdictions.
 
(ii)

and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company on behalf of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
 
(B)
          
each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company on behalf of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(I)

(iii)
         
Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or
render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) or the provision of documents or forms required under applicable Laws) to avoid or minimize any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that any Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

Treatment of Certain Refunds
.

If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that each Borrower, upon the
provided
 
request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
 
3.02.
      
Illegality
.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal  for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
3.03.
      
Inability to Determine Rates
.  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Section 3.01
 
(iii)
         
result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans; or
 
(iv)
         
impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
Section 3.01

the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(d)
          
Delay in Requests
.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
provided
 
(e)
          
Additional Reserve Requirements
.  The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender,
(i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Company shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
provided

any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b)

(c)
          
any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or

LOS ANGELES (Aug. 4, 2011)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which ended June 30, 2011.
 
AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $74 million for the third quarter, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents.  These results represent an increase of 14% over net income of $65 million  and an increase of 11% over diluted EPS of 56 cents  for the same period last year.  Operating income for the third quarter increased to $110 million, 19% higher than the same period last year.
 
AECOM's third-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, increased to $1.3 billion, 24% higher than the same period last year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 4% year over year. Third-quarter gross revenue increased to $2.0 billion, 25% higher than the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
For year-to-date fiscal year 2011, AECOM reported net income from continuing operations of $188 million and operating income of $288 million, an increase of 11% and 19%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.  For year-to-date fiscal year 2011, AECOM reported revenue, net of other direct costs, of $3.8 billion and revenue of $5.9 billion, an increase of 24% and 25%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
 
"We had a solid third quarter, posting 11% earnings growth, driven by gains in organic and acquisitive net service revenue," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer. "We also recorded $2.7 billion in new wins, up from $2.2 billion in the second quarter, and organic backlog increased 18% year over year, the largest increase in over two years.
 
"Organic growth in the third quarter was led by strong results in Australia, Asia, and the Middle East.  AECOM's expanding presence in these high-growth markets, in combination with our integrated platform, position us to capitalize on the full scope of infrastructure opportunities around the world."
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.8 billion and operating income of $115 million, compared to revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of $108 million for the same period during fiscal year 2010.  This represents a 33% increase in revenue and a 6% increase in operating income year over year.  PTS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 21% year over year to $1.2 billion.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the MSS segment reported gross revenue of $274 million and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $144 million, compared to revenue of $297 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $98 million for the same period during fiscal year 2010.  This represents an 8% decrease in revenue contrasted by a 48% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs, highlighting a change in the mix of the business.  In addition, the MSS segment reported operating income of $19 million compared to $13 million for the same period during fiscal year 2010, which represents a 48% year-over-year increase.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog totaling $16.0 billion at June 30, 2011, a 66% increase year over year.  Organically, backlog increased by 18% year over year.
 
Balance Sheet
 
At June 30, 2011, the company had $381 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt and $600 million in committed bank facilities with $293 million in unused capacity.  Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the company announced a new 5-year revolving credit facility agreement with total borrowing capacity of $1.05 billion.
 
"We are pleased to have closed our new revolving credit facility, which substantially increases our borrowing capacity on more favorable terms," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "We believe this demonstrates the credit market's confidence in our financial strength and provides us with increased financial flexibility to execute on our growth strategy."
 
Outlook
 
"Improvements in organic growth and a significant increase in new wins and backlog during the third quarter give us confidence in our long-term earnings growth target of 15%," Burke said.  "However, continued challenges in our Western European business have led us to evaluate actions to reduce our cost structure, which may negatively impact our earnings by approximately $0.05 in the fourth quarter."   As a result, AECOM's EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011 is $2.30-$2.35.

Other Events.
 
On August 16, 2011, AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"), pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to $200 million of its common stock. Share repurchases under this program may be effected through open market purchases, unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or other methods, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
 
On August 16, 2011, in accordance with the Repurchase Program, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"). Under the agreement for the ASR (the "ASR Agreement"), the Company will repurchase $100 million of the approved $200 million worth of shares of its common stock from Bank of America.
 
In connection with the ASR the Company will pay $100 million to Bank of America in exchange for one or more deliveries by Bank of America of the Company's outstanding common shares. A majority of the shares owed to the Company by Bank of America will be delivered to the Company on August 19, 2011. The specific number of shares that ultimately will be repurchased by the Company under the ASR Agreement will be based up on the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount, subject to collar provisions establishing a maximum and minimum price and other customary conditions under the ASR Agreement. The Company expects all ASR purchases to be completed either during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 or the first fiscal quarter of 2012, with the exact date of completion to depend on whether Bank of America exercises one of the acceleration options that it has under the ASR Agreement. At settlement, the Company may be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock from Bank of America or under certain circumstances may be required to issue additional shares or make a payment to Bank of America at the Company's option.
 
The Company issued a press release on August 16, 2011 announcing its stock repurchase program.  A copy of that press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AECOM announces $200 million share repurchase program
 
Plan includes $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement
 
LOS ANGELES (Aug. 16, 2011)  AECOM Technology Corp. (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of its common stock.
 
In connection with the authorization of the repurchase program, AECOM has entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Bank of America N.A. to repurchase $100 million of its common stock.  This transaction will enable the company to reduce its outstanding share count shortly after execution of the agreement.
 
"The Board's share repurchase authorization reflects its confidence in our long-term outlook and acknowledges this opportunity to create shareholder value by purchasing our shares at what we believe is a significant discount to their intrinsic value," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM president and chief executive officer.  "The share repurchase program complements our strategy of balanced growth, and we will continue to deploy our strong balance sheet to invest in both organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, which we believe will drive long-term growth for AECOM."
 
Under the accelerated share repurchase agreement, AECOM will provide $100 million to Bank of America N.A. and receive a majority of the shares to be repurchased on Aug. 19, 2011.  The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the agreement will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of AECOM's common stock over the term of the agreement, subject to a collar provision establishing the maximum and minimum price at which the repurchase will occur as well as other customary conditions.
 
Bank of America is expected to purchase shares of AECOM common stock in the open market in connection with the accelerated share repurchase.  AECOM expects all purchases under the accelerated share repurchase to be completed in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2011 or the first quarter of 2012, with the exact date of completion to depend on whether Bank of America exercises one of the acceleration options that it has under the share repurchase agreement.  At final settlement of the transaction, AECOM may be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock from Bank of America or, under certain circumstances, may be required to issue additional shares or make a payment to Bank of America at AECOM's option.
 
The remaining shares authorized in the share repurchase program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market at the company's discretion, subject to market conditions, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 
2-2-2
 
 
"The accelerated share repurchase agreement enables us to immediately execute an accretive transaction that will benefit our shareholders," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM executive vice president and chief financial officer.  "Given our strong balance sheet and outlook, we can execute the share repurchase program and continue making strategic investments in the business  while remaining well within our targeted leverage ratio range of 1.5 to 2.0 times net debt to EBITDA."

Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 30, 2011, AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $750 million in term loans on the closing date and may borrow up to an additional $100 million in term loans upon request by the Company subject to certain conditions, including Company and lender approval. The Company used approximately $600 million of the proceeds of the loans to repay indebtedness under its prior term loan facility, approximately $147 million of the proceeds to pay down indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and a portion of the proceeds to pay fees and expenses related to the Credit Agreement.
 
The loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.375% to 1.50% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is a range of 1.375% to 2.50%, both based on the debt-to-earnings leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter. The initial interest rate of the loans borrowed on September 30 is the 3 month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.75%, or a total of 2.12%.
 
Payments of the initial principal amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement are required on a quarterly basis beginning on December 31, 2012. Any remaining principal of the loans under the Credit Agreement is due no later than July 20, 2016. Accrued interest is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis for Base Rate loans, and at the end of the applicable interest period (but at least every three months) for Eurodollar Rate loans. The Company may optionally prepay the loans at any time, without penalty.

The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

LOS ANGELES (Nov. 10, 2011)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2011.
 
AECOM reported net income attributable to AECOM of $87 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents for the fourth quarter.  This represents an increase of 29% over net income of $68 million for the same period last year and an increase of 29% over diluted earnings per share of 58 cents for the same period last year.  Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 35% year over year to $134 million.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue was $2.1 billion, a 16% increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Fourth-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.4 billion, representing a 20% increase over the same period last year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, for the fourth quarter increased 7% year over year.
 
For the full fiscal year 2011, AECOM reported net income attributable to AECOM of $276 million and diluted EPS of $2.33.  This represents an increase of 16% over net income of $237 million for the same period last year and an increase of 14% over diluted EPS of $2.05 for the same period last year.  Operating income for the full year increased 24% year over year to $421 million.  For fiscal year 2011, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 23% to $5.2 billion, while revenue for fiscal year 2011 was $8.0 billion  23% higher than fiscal year 2010.
 
"Overall, 2011 was a good year for AECOM," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "During the year, we integrated a number of acquisitions, which strengthened our capabilities in important end markets, including construction, power, energy, mining, and cyber security and intelligence.  This enabled us to deliver record new wins of $9.3 billion, backlog of $15.6 billion and earnings growth of 14%."
 
"We are poised for continued growth in 2012 with strong positions in the world's most robust and well-funded infrastructure markets," Dionisio added.  "Looking ahead, we will focus our global resources on our best and most profitable opportunities across our diversified end markets and geographies.  Finally, we will continue to focus on increasing cash flow and improving working capital and margins as well as effective capital allocation."
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and government clients worldwide.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.9 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.2 billion, compared to revenue of $1.5 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.0 billion in the same period last year.  This represents a 23% increase in revenue and an 18% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs.  PTS segment operating income increased 22% from last year to $147 million.
 
For the full year, the PTS segment reported revenue of $6.9 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $4.6 billion compared to revenue of $5.4 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $3.8 billion last year.  This represents an increase of 27% in revenue and a 20% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs, from last year.  In addition, full year PTS segment operating income increased 11% from last year to $445 million.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the MSS segment reported revenue of $235 million and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $147 million, compared to revenue of $294 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $105 million for the same period during fiscal year 2010.  This represents a 20% decrease in revenue contrasted by a 40% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs, highlighting a change in the mix of the business.  In addition, the MSS segment reported operating income of $18 million compared to $12 million for the same period during fiscal year 2010, which represents a 56% year-over-year increase.
 
For the full year, the MSS segment reported revenue of $1.16 billion and operating income of $78 million.  This represents an increase of 1% over revenue of $1.15 billion for fiscal year 2010 and an increase of 51% over operating income of $52 million for fiscal year 2010.  For the full fiscal year 2011, MSS revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 55% to $569 million.
 
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
 
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased by 128% from the prior year to $262 million.  As of Sept. 30, 2011, AECOM had $457 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt and $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities with $917 million in unused capacity.
 
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced total backlog of $15.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2011, a 6% increase year over year.  Excluding backlog obtained through acquisitions, total backlog increased 3% year over year.  Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted backlog by $150 million during the fourth quarter.
 
Outlook
 
"AECOM continues to expand its presence in high-growth emerging and natural-resource-rich markets that now constitute over 40% of our net service revenue," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM president.  "Overall, 59% of our net service revenue is derived from non-U.S. markets, providing us with confidence in our long-term outlook."
 
Building upon the progress achieved in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, AECOM expects diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2012 to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65.  The initial 2012 earnings guidance range includes the following key assumptions: 2012 tax rate of 29% (inclusive of non-controlling interest deduction), interest expense of $43 million, amortization of intangibles expense of $24 million, depreciation expense of $75 million, and full-year share count of 116 million.

LOS ANGELES (Feb. 2, 2012)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for public and private sector clients in more than 130 countries around the world,
announced today
its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended Dec. 31, 2011.
 
AECOM reported net income of $48 million for the first quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents for the first quarter.  This represents a decrease of 16% from net income of $57 million and a decrease of 13% from diluted earnings per share of 48 cents for the same period last year.  Operating income for the first quarter was $77 million, a decrease of 15% from the same period last year.
 
First-quarter revenue was $2.0 billion, a 5% increase from the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure and excludes such pass-through costs, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  First-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.2 billion, representing a 1% increase over the same period last year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, for the first quarter increased 0.4% year over year.  Organic revenue, net of other direct costs, excludes revenue, net of other direct costs, from acquired companies, which is defined as revenue, net of other direct costs, included in the current period up to 12 months subsequent to their acquisition date.
 
"Our results for the first quarter are in line with our expectations and consistent with what we discussed on our fourth-quarter earnings call.  We maintain our outlook for the full year," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "More importantly, we delivered key wins across our diversified platform during the quarter  highlighted by signifcant backlog growth in our emerging markets and across our geographies.  We are well positioned to build on this momentum."

Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.8 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.1 billion, compared to revenue of $1.6 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.08 billion in the same period last year.  This represents a 15% increase in revenue and a 1% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs. PTS segment operating income was $87.3 million compared to $91.6 million last year.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, the MSS segment reported revenue of $221.8 million and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $129.9 million, compared to revenue of $360.4 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $129.0 million for the same period during fiscal year 2011.  This represents a 38% decrease in revenue contrasted by a 1% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs, highlighting a change in the mix of the business.  In addition, the MSS segment reported operating income of $12.0 million compared to $21.8 million for the same period during fiscal year 2011.
 
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
 
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 improved by $173 million from the prior year to negative $6 million.  As of Dec. 31, 2011, AECOM had $507 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt with $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities that have $842 million in unused capacity.
 
Backlog
 
AECOM announced backlog of $15.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, a 2% increase year over year.  Excluding backlog obtained through acquisitions, total backlog increased 2% year over year.
 
Outlook
 
"Our $2.2 billion in new wins during the first quarter, coupled with the visibility provided by our backlog of $15.8 billion, give us confidence in the balance of fiscal 2012 and beyond," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM president.  "The positive momentum that we delivered in our power, energy and mining markets during the quarter reflects our ability to optimize our operational performance this year and over the long term."
 
AECOM expects diluted earnings per share results for fiscal year 2012 to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65.  The 2012 earnings guidance range includes the following key assumptions: 2012 tax rate of 29%, inclusive of non-controlling interest deduction; interest expense of $43 million; amortization of intangibles expense of $24 million; depreciation expense of $76 million; and full-year share count of 115 million.

Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
To further enhance the link between compensation philosophy and pay practices, and specifically to strengthen the alignment between pay and company performance, the Compensation/Organization Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of AECOM Technology Corporation ("AECOM") has approved amended stock option and restricted stock unit standard terms and conditions for the fiscal year 2011 awards (the "Awards") made under the AECOM Technology Corporation Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan ("2006 Plan") to AECOM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The Awards were originally scheduled to vest in three annual installments, subject to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's continued service with AECOM.  One-third of the shares subject to each of the Awards vested on December 8, 2011 and the shares subject to the vested portion of the restricted stock unit award were issued to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at that time.  The amended standard terms and conditions add performance conditions to the Awards and provide that (i) the portion of the stock options that previously vested in 2011 shall no longer be considered vested or exercisable and instead shall vest in 2012, (ii) all unvested Awards scheduled to vest in December 2012 shall vest in full only if AECOM achieves at least 5% EPS growth in its 2012 fiscal year, (iii) all unvested Awards scheduled to vest in December 2013 shall vest in full only if AECOM achieves at least 5% compound annual EPS growth for its 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, and (iv) no portion of the unvested Awards scheduled to vest in 2012 or 2013, respectively, shall vest if AECOM's applicable EPS growth rate for the relevant period is 0% or less.
 
The amended stock option and restricted stock unit standard terms and conditions apply to all fiscal year 2011 stock option and restricted stock unit grants awarded under the 2006 Plan to AECOM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The Committee determined that 5% is an appropriate EPS growth rate for the next two fiscal years and is consistent with AECOM's stated EPS guidance range for fiscal year 2012 and AECOM's strategic plan for that period.  In establishing the performance criteria, the Committee also considered that, over the past five years, the compound annual EPS growth rate for S&P 500 companies was approximately 3%.
 
The foregoing description of the amended stock option and restricted stock unit standard terms and conditions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of such forms attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02.

Amended Restricted Stock Unit Standard Terms and Conditions under 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

Exhibit 10.1
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Options granted to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on December 8, 2010 under the AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.
 
1.
                                     
TERMS OF OPTION
 
AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Optionee named in the Term Sheet provided to said Optionee herewith (the "Term Sheet") a non-qualified stock option (the "Option") to purchase up to the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), set forth in Term Sheet, at the purchase price per share and upon the other terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions (as amended from time to time, and including Attachment A hereto), and the Plan specified in the Term Sheet (the "Plan").  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.
 
2.
                                     
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION
 
The Option is not intended to be an incentive stock Option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly.
 
3.
                                     
EXERCISE OF OPTION
 
The Option shall not be exercisable as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet.  After the Grant Date, to the extent not previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Option shall be exercisable to the extent it becomes vested, as described in the Term Sheet and Attachment A hereto, to purchase up to that number of shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Term Sheet provided that (except as set forth in Section 4) Optionee remains employed with the Company and does not experience a termination of employment. The vesting period and/or exercisability of the Option shall be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the effects of any period during which the Optionee is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis, provided that no such adjustment may be made which would result in an accounting charge to the Company.
 
To exercise the Option (or any part thereof), Optionee shall deliver a "Notice of Exercise" to the Company specifying the number of whole shares of Common Stock Optionee wishes to purchase and how Optionee's shares of Common Stock should be registered (in Optionee's name only or in Optionee's and Optionee's spouse's names as community property, as joint tenants with right of survivorship, or such other form of
personal ownership allowed by the Company in the Optionee's locality or state of residence).
 
The exercise price (the "Exercise Price") of the Option is set forth in the Term Sheet.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock until Optionee shall have paid the total Exercise Price for that number of shares of Common Stock.  The Exercise Price may be paid by delivery of a personal check.  In addition, the Administrator may permit the Exercise Price to be paid:
 
A.
                                   
Broker Assisted: By payment under an arrangement with a broker where payment is made pursuant to an irrevocable commitment by a broker to deliver in the future all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the Option shares to the Company.
 
B.
                                   
Share Tender: By tendering (either physically or by attestation) shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee and having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price but only if such tender will not result in an accounting charge to the Company.
 
C.
                                   
Cashless: By the Company withholding from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Optionee upon the exercise of the Option (or portion thereof) the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a fair market value on the date of exercise sufficient to satisfy the Exercise Price.  If the withheld shares are not sufficient to pay the Exercise Price, the Optionee shall pay to the Company on the date of exercise any amount of the Exercise Price that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above and if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Exercise Price the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Optionee's benefit.
 
D.
                                   
Combination: By any combination of the foregoing or in such other form(s) of consideration as the Administrator (as defined in the Plan) in its discretion shall specify.
 
Fractional shares may not be exercised.  Shares of Common Stock will be issued as soon as practical after exercise. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the exercisability of the Option or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws.
 
4.
                                     
EXPIRATION OF OPTION
 
Except as provided in this Section 4, the Option shall expire and cease to be exercisable as of the Expiration Date set forth in the Term Sheet.  For purposes of the Option, "termination of employment" means ceasing to serve as a full-time employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except that (i) the Administrator may determine, subject to the Plan, that an approved leave of absence or approved employment on a less than full-time basis is not considered a "termination of employment," (ii) the Administrator may
determine that a transition of employment to service with a partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party is not considered a "termination of employment," and (iii) service as a member of the Board shall constitute continued employment with respect to the Option.
 
A.
                                   
Upon the date of a termination of employment for any reason other than a termination of employment by the Company for death, Total and Permanent Disablement or Cause, (i) any part of the Option that is unexercisable as of such termination date shall remain unexercisable and shall terminate as of such date, and (ii) any part of the Option that is exercisable as of the date of termination shall be exercisable by the Optionee at any time during the one (1) year following the date of termination and shall terminate at the end of such one (1) year period but in no event will the one (1) year period go beyond the Expiration Date set forth in the Term Sheet.
 
B.
                                   
Upon the date of a termination of employment by the Company due to the Optionee's death or Total and Permanent Disablement, the Option shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable by the Optionee (or, in the case of the Optionee's death, the Optionee's estate, heir or beneficiary) at any time during the one (1) year following the date of termination and shall terminate at the end of such one (1) year period but in no event will the one (1) year period go beyond the Expiration Date set forth in the Term Sheet.
 
C.
                                   
Upon the date of the Optionee's termination of employment for Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised as of the day prior to the date of such termination, shall terminate as of the date of termination.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time that the Option would otherwise expire pursuant to this Section 4 (other than in connection with a termination of employment by the Company for Cause), the Optionee is prohibited from exercising the Option because such an exercise would, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, violate applicable securities laws, the period during which the Option may be exercised shall automatically be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days following the first date on which the exercise of the Option would no longer violate applicable securities laws.
 
5.
                                     
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OPTION SHARES
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Optionee or other subsequent transfers by the Optionee of any shares of Common Stock issued as a result of the exercise of the Option, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Optionee and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Optionee have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Optionee any Shares acquired by the Optionee under the Option.  Any Shares acquired by the Optionee under the Option may not be repurchased by the Company for a period of six (6) months following the date on which the Optionee acquired such Shares pursuant to the Option.
 
6.
                                     
INCOME TAXES
 
The Optionee will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on the date (generally, the date of exercise) determined by applicable law, based on the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the portion of the Option that is exercised over the Exercise Price.  The Optionee will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the exercise of the Option, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid over to the applicable tax authorities (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), if any. The Optionee will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Optionee until the Optionee satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation, if any.  The Optionee acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable upon exercise of the Option (or any portion thereof) or from salary or other amounts payable to the Optionee, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, if any.
 
The Optionee is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Optionee in connection with the Option, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 6 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Option. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or exercise of the Option or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee's tax liability.
 
7.
                                     
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Optionee may not assign or transfer the Option to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and the Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee during his or her lifetime. The
Company may cancel the Optionee's Option if the Optionee attempts to assign or transfer it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 7.
 
8.
                                     
THE PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
 
In addition to these Terms and Conditions, the Option shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Plan.
 
The Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions (including Attachment A hereto) and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Optionee and the Company regarding the Option.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Option are superseded.
 
9.
                                     
LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION
 
Neither the Optionee (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Optionee shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Term Sheet or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person upon exercise of the Option or any part of it.  Nothing in the Plan, in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue in the Company's employ or service nor limit in any way the Company's right to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time for any reason.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and Conditions and/or Term Sheet relating to your award of options (the "Award"), (a) the portion of your Award that vested on December 8, 2011 (the "2011 Tranche") shall, as of the date hereof, no long be considered vested for purposes of the Award and the Standard Terms and Conditions and shall not be eligible to vest until December 8, 2012, and (b) the 2011 Tranche, the portion of your Award originally scheduled to vest on December 8, 2012 (the "2012 Tranche") and the portion of your Award scheduled to vest on December 8, 2013 (the "2013 Tranche"), shall, subject to the other conditions set forth in the Standard Terms and Conditions and Term Sheet, vest only and to the extent the Company achieves an EPS (as defined below) growth rate over FY2012 and FY2013 as provided in the following tables:
 
a)
            
The portion of your Award eligible to vest in December 2012:
 
 
b)

If results fall between the levels set forth in the tables above, the portion of the award vesting shall be determined by linear interpolation.
 
For purposes of this Attachment A, the term "EPS" for a fiscal year means the Company's fully-diluted earnings per share for that year.

Exhibit 10.2
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Award of restricted stock units granted to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on December 8, 2010 under the AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and its amendments (the "Plan"), which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.
 
1.
                                     
TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant named in the Term Sheet provided to said Participant herewith (the "Term Sheet") an award of a number of restricted stock units (the "Award") specified in the Term Sheet.  Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions (including Attachment A hereto), and the Plan, each as amended from time to time.  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall, unless the context requires otherwise, include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.
 
2.
                                     
VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet and these Standard Terms and Conditions (including Attachment A hereto).  After the Grant Date, subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Award shall become vested as described in the Term Sheet and Attachment A hereto; provided that (except as set forth in Section 5 below) the Participant does not experience a termination of employment (as defined in the Plan).  Each date on which restricted stock units subject to the Award vest is referred to herein as a "Vesting Date."  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Term Sheet to the contrary, if a Vesting Date is not a business day, the applicable portion of the Award shall vest on the prior business day.  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Vested Units."  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that are not vested and remain subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Unvested Units."  The vesting period of the Award may be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the decreased level of employment during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis, provided that the Administrator may take into consideration any accounting consequences to the Company in making any such adjustment.
3.
                                     
SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
Each Vested Unit will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan) to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary, promptly following the applicable Vesting Date (but in no event later than 90 days following the Vesting Date); provided that the Participant has satisfied all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below, and that the Participant has completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Company deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock.  The issuance of the shares of Common Stock hereunder may be affected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant's behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.
 
Notwithstanding the above, (i) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, (ii) the Company may issue shares of Common Stock hereunder subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Company's counsel, are necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (iii) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters (which delay shall in no event extend beyond 90 days following the Vesting Date).
 
4.
                                     
RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
 
Prior to any issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of the Award, no shares of Common Stock will be reserved or earmarked for the Participant or the Participant's account nor shall the Participant have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares. The Participant will not be entitled to any privileges of ownership of the shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, any voting or dividend rights) underlying Vested Units and/or Unvested Units unless and until shares of Common Stock are actually delivered to the Participant hereunder.
 
5.
                                     
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
Upon the date of the Participant's termination of employment (as defined in the Plan) for any reason, except as provided in this Section 5, all Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
 
A.
                                   
Upon the date of a termination of the Participant's employment as a result of the death of the Participant, the Award will vest in full and the Vested Units will be paid to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary.
B.
                                   
Upon termination of employment by the Company as a result of the Total and Permanent Disablement of any Participant, the Award will vest in full.
 
C.
                                   
Upon termination of the Participant's employment for Cause, all Vested Units and Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
 
6.
                                     
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of Vested Units, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Participant have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Participant any Shares acquired by the Participant under the Award.  Any Shares acquired by such Participant under the Award may not be repurchased by the Company for a period of six (6) months following the date on which the Participant acquired such Shares pursuant the Award.
 
7.
                                     
INCOME TAXES
 
The Participant will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on a date (generally, the Settlement Date) determined by applicable law (any such date, the "Taxable Date"), based on the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the units that are vested.  The Participant will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the Vested Units, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid to the applicable tax authorities (the "Tax Withholding Obligation").  The Participant will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
By accepting the Award the Participant agrees that, unless and to the extent the Participant has otherwise satisfied the Tax Withholding Obligations in a manner permitted or required by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan, the Company is authorized to withhold from the shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant in respect of Vested Units the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a value (as determined by the Company consistent with any applicable tax requirements) on the
Taxable Date or the first trading day before the Taxable Date sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. If the withheld shares are not sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above and if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Participant's benefit.
 
At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Settlement Date), the Participant may elect to satisfy all or any part of the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient (in light of the uncertainty of the exact amount thereof) to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a personal check payable to the Company, or (iii) such other means as specified from time to time by the Administrator, in each case unless the Company has specified prior to such date that the Participant is not permitted to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable under the Award or from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Participant in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 7 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying Vested Units. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's tax liability.
 
8.
                                     
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Participant may not assign, transfer or pledge the Award, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto or any right or interest therein to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The Company may cancel the Participant's Award if the Participant attempts to assign or transfer it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 8.
 
9.
                                     
THE PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
 
In addition to these Terms and Conditions, the Award shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference. Certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Plan. In the
event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of these Standard Terms and Condition and the Plan, the Plan controls.
 
The Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions (including Attachment A hereto) and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Award.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Award are superseded.
 
10.
                              
LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARD
 
Neither the Participant (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Term Sheet or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person in respect of Vested Units.
 
11.
                              
NOT A CONTRACT FOR EMPLOYMENT
 
Nothing in the Plan, in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Company's employ or service nor limit in any way the Company's right to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason.
 
12.
                              
SECTION 409A
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, this Award is not intended to provide for a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and is intended to qualify for as a "short-term deferral" under Section 409A of the Code, and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be construed or deemed to be amended as necessary to effect such intent.  Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any liability under the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
 
13.

DISPUTES
 
All questions arising under the Plan or under these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be decided by the Administrator in its total and absolute discretion.  In the event the Participant or other holder of an Award believes that a decision by the Administrator with respect to such person was arbitrary or capricious, the Participant or other holder may request arbitration with respect to such decision in accordance with the terms of the Plan.  The review by the arbitrator shall be limited to determining whether the Administrator's decision was arbitrary or capricious.  This arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive review permitted of the Administrator's decision, and the Participant and any other holder hereby explicitly waive any right to judicial review.
19.
                              
ELECTRONIC DELIVERY
 
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to any awards granted under the Plan by electronic means or to request the Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. By accepting the Award, the Participant consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company, and such consent shall remain in effect throughout the Participant's term of employment or service with the Company and thereafter until withdrawn in writing by the Participant.

LOS ANGELES (May 3, 2012)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for public and private sector clients in more than 130 countries around the world, announced today its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.
 
Second-quarter revenue was $2.0 billion, a 4% increase from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.  AECOM's gross revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs, which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a valuable perspective on its business results.  Second-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs, was $1.3 billion.
 
AECOM reported net income attributable to AECOM of $49 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents for the second quarter. This represents a decrease of 15% from net income of $58 million and a decrease of 12% from diluted earnings per share of 49 cents for the same period last year.  Operating income for the second quarter decreased 16% from last year to $73 million.
 
For the first six months of fiscal year 2012, AECOM reported net income attributable to AECOM of $97 million and diluted EPS of 85 cents, a decrease of 15% and 12%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.  Operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2012 decreased 16% year over year to $150 million.  For the first six months of fiscal year 2012, the company's revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 1% to $2.5 billion, while revenue was $4.0 billion  4% higher than the same period last year.
 
"During the quarter, we saw strength in our Professional Technical Services segment driven by accelerated growth in key end markets and regions, including emerging and natural resources as well as Asia.  This growth was enabled by investments that we have made to enhance our capabilities across AECOM," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "Unfortunately, this strength was overshadowed by challenges in our Management Support Services segment."
 
As a result of these factors, AECOM is adjusting its full-year EPS guidance to $2.30 to $2.45.

New Wins and Backlog
 
"Our new wins accelerated sequentially, topping $2.4 billion, while backlog also was up sequentially to $16 billion  a 4% increase year over year.  These metrics demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as clients increasingly turn to AECOM for our integrated service platform and global expertise," added Michael S. Burke, AECOM president.  "This demand, coupled with a broad-based improvement in profitability during the second half, will allow us to achieve our target of generating free cash flow roughly equal to net income this year."
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, the PTS segment reported revenue of $1.8 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.2 billion, compared to revenue of $1.6 billion and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $1.1 billion in the same period last year.  This represents a 9% increase in revenue and a 2% increase in revenue, net of other direct costs.  PTS segment operating income was $91 million compared to $92 million last year.
 
Management Support Services
The MSS segment provides facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, the MSS segment reported revenue of $209.8 million and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $126.4 million, compared to revenue of $290.8 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, of $148.6 million for the same period during fiscal year 2011.  This represents a 28% decrease in revenue and a 15% decrease in revenue, net of other direct costs.  In addition, the MSS segment reported operating income of $2 million compared to $19 million for the same period during fiscal year 2011.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
 
As of March 31, 2012, AECOM had $466 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.3 billion of debt and $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities with $807 million in unused capacity.  Cash flow from operations totaled $11 million in the quarter.

AECOM reports third-quarter fiscal year 2012 financial results
 
                 
Strength in Asia-Pacific, Canada, civil infrastructure, and power, energy, and mining drive $2.1 billion in revenue, EPS of $0.63.

LOS ANGELES (Aug. 7, 2012)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM) reported third-quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, a 2.4% increase from the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.  Third-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs
1
, was $1.3 billion.  Operating income for the third quarter decreased 6.5% from last year to $103 million due to challenging year-over-year performance in the Management Support Services (MSS) segment.  Net income attributable to the company declined 6% to $69 million and earnings per share (EPS) grew 1.6% to 63 cents.
 
 
All growth comparisons that follow are year over year unless noted otherwise.
 
"During the quarter, our organic net service revenue, on a currency-neutral basis, improved to 2% led by strength in our Asia, Australia and Canada operations with solid growth in our civil infrastructure as well as our power, energy and mining end markets," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "In addition, we made further investments to enhance our capabilities to accelerate our growth in the future."
 
As of June 30, 2012, AECOM had $398 million of total cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of debt, equating to AECOM's lowest net debt in seven quarters.  In addition, AECOM reported $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities with $985 million in unused capacity.  Cash flow from operations totaled $202 million in the quarter, while free cash flow totaled $186 million.
 
"Our strong third-quarter free cash flow generation of $186 million exceeded our expectations and illustrates the progress we are making to improve our balance of growth, profitability and liquidity.  During the quarter, we completed the balance of our initial $200 million share repurchase program and repaid $175 million in debt," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM president.  "Improved execution on our margin initiatives was evident in our sequential earnings growth, and we enter our strongest quarter of the year with good momentum."

New Wins and Backlog
 
During the third quarter, new wins totaled $2.0 billion, while backlog at June 30, 2012, was $15.8 billion.  These metrics demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as clients increasingly turn to AECOM for our integrated service platform and global expertise.
 
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
Revenue of $1.85 billion grew 4%, and revenue, net of other direct costs, declined slightly by 0.4% to $1.16 billion.  Operating income increased 4.5% to $120 million reflecting the benefits of the company's operational efficiency and margin improvement initiatives.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
Revenue declined 9.2% to $248.7 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 10.1% to $158.9 million.  Operating income declined 80% to $4 million; however, on a sequential basis, operating income grew 92% consistent with the company's recovery plan for the segment.
 
 
Fiscal 2012 Outlook
AECOM reaffirms its EPS outlook for fiscal year 2012 of $2.30 to $2.45 and, given its current outlook, expects to be at the low end of this range.  In the fourth quarter, the company expects typical seasonal improvement in its PTS segment, margin improvement across the Americas and Europe, and continued recovery in its MSS segment.  On a full-year basis, the company expects free cash flow to meet or exceed next income.

Reported EPS of $(2.05), $0.83 on an adjusted basis, excluding the impairment charge.
                 
Company targets full-year diluted EPS of $2.40 to $2.50 for fiscal year 2013.
 
LOS ANGELES (Nov. 13, 2012)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year for fiscal 2012, which ended Sept. 30, 2012.  The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.1 billion.  In addition, fourth-quarter revenue, net of other direct costs
1
, was $1.3 billion.  Due to the $336-million impairment charge ($317 million net of tax), the company reported an operating loss of $199 million, a net loss of $225 million, and a loss per share of $2.05 for the fourth quarter.  Adjusted to exclude the goodwill impairment charge, operating income was $137 million, net income was $92 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.83 in the fourth quarter.
 
During the fourth quarter, in connection with its annual goodwill impairment testing, the company concluded that an impairment of its goodwill existed within its Europe business and its Management Support Services (MSS) reporting unit.  As a result, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.88 per share or $317 million net of tax.  In Europe, the impairment charge resulted primarily from the negative impact of economic trends, which drove a reduction in profit levels.  The impairment in MSS was largely driven by the loss of revenue due to the precipitous drawdown of troops in Iraq during 2012.  Based on the strong growth in profit in the second half of fiscal 2012, the company expects that both its Europe and MSS businesses will show strong growth in profitability in fiscal 2013.  The impairment did not have any impact on the company's compliance with its debt covenants, its cash flows or its operations.
 
 
For purposes of comparison, the discussion below of results excludes the impact of the impairment charge unless noted otherwise.  Also, all growth comparisons that follow are year over year unless noted otherwise.
 
 
 
 
2-2-2
 
"I am pleased with the progress that we made sequentially in the quarter on growth and profitability," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "We won $2.3 billion in new wins during the quarter, driving backlog up 3% year over year to $16 billion.  Our unyielding commitment to improved profitability lifted EBITDA margins to 12%  a record level for the fourth quarter.  Our results clearly demonstrate the progress that we've made to drive a performance culture committed to improved growth, profitability and liquidity.  For fiscal year 2013, we are targeting earnings per share of $2.40-$2.50, which reflects continued pressure on growth as a result of the global macro-economic climate."
 
"Our company-wide focus on improving our cash-conversion metrics allowed us to generate $211 million in free cash flow for the quarter and $370 million for the year," said AECOM President Michael S. Burke.  "In addition, our liquidity and balanced capital allocation strategy allowed us to spend $62 million in the quarter to repurchase 3 million shares.  Since the inception of our repurchase program in 2011, we have invested over $300 million to repurchase 15 million shares, reducing our share count by 13%."
 
New Wins and Backlog
 
During the fourth quarter, new wins totaled $2.3 billion, while backlog at Sept. 30, 2012, was $16 billion.  These metrics demonstrate the underlying strength of AECOM as clients increasingly turn to the company for its integrated service platform and global expertise.
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3.2%, and revenue, net of other direct costs, declined by 2.8% to $1.2 billion as double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific was offset by the challenging environment in the United States and in Europe.  Adjusted operating income increased 5.6% to $143 million, reflecting the benefits of our operational improvement initiatives.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue increased 11.0% to $261 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 10.1% to $161 million, primarily due to a higher level of activity in Asia and the Middle East.  Adjusted operating income declined 34.8% to $12 million; however, on a sequential basis, adjusted operating income grew 211.2% consistent with the company's recovery plan for the segment.

(e)    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
 
On December 17, 2012, the Compensation/Organization Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of AECOM Technology Corporation ("AECOM") approved the AECOM Technology Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"), which is a defined contribution nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  The DCP will become effective February 1, 2013.
 
The DCP will enable select U.S. non-employee directors and highly compensated employees of AECOM, including all of AECOM's named executive officers, to defer receipt of certain compensation.  Eligible participants may elect to defer a percentage of their base salary, director fees, and/or bonus compensation, as applicable, to accounts maintained under the DCP.  AECOM may, in its sole discretion, provide additional contributions to the DCP on behalf of participants.
 
The DCP permits participants to elect to receive distributions commencing after their separation from service in either a lump sum cash payment or annual installments of 5 or 10 years.  Alternatively, participants may elect to receive distributions under the Plan at a specified date (selected at the time of the deferral), which may be prior to their separation from service.  Participants may also be permitted to withdraw their vested account balance in the event of an unforeseeable financial emergency.
 
New and Amended Restricted Stock Unit Standard Terms and Conditions
 
On December 17, 2012, the Committee also approved a new form of restricted stock unit ("RSU") standard terms and conditions to be used in connection with RSU awards made under the AECOM Technology Corporation Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan").  The Committee also amended the existing RSU standard terms and conditions for all outstanding RSU awards under the 2006 Plan, except those granted to Australian employees.
 
The new and amended RSU standard terms and conditions will be used with awards made to all executive officers, including all of the named executive officers, and provide for pro-rata vesting of certain RSU awards made under the 2006 Plan upon a participant's retirement from active employment with AECOM at age 65 or between the ages of 60 and 65 with management approval.  In order to receive pro-rata vesting, the award recipient must meet or exceed expectations with respect to his or her individual performance, execute a general release of all claims, and abide by a non-solicitation and/or non-competition agreement in a form provided by the Committee.  The pro-rata vesting will be based upon the number of months in the award's vesting period and the number of whole months from the beginning of the vesting period through the recipient's date of retirement.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the DCP and the new and amended RSU standard terms and conditions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of such documents attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02.

(b)           For Plan Years following the Initial Plan Year, Participant's election to defer Base Salary, Bonus or Director Fees for a Plan Year shall be submitted prior to January 1 of the Plan Year in which such amounts are first earned (or at such earlier time as may be established by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion).

Such election shall become effective as of the first pay period after the date on which the election form is submitted to the Administrative Committee.
(d)           Notwithstanding subsection (a) and (b) above, the Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit an Eligible Participant (to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A and any regulations thereunder) to submit an election to defer any Bonus which qualifies as Performance-Based Compensation no later than six (6) months before the end of the performance period (or at such earlier time as may be established by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion).  To be eligible to make such a deferral election, the Eligible Participant must have continuously performed services for the Employer from the later of (1) the beginning of the performance period, or (2) the date upon which the performance criteria for such compensation are established, through the date upon which the Eligible Participant makes the deferral election for such compensation.

Reg. Section 1.409A-2(a)(8)).

Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xii)) shall, to the extent provided by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xii), be cancelled for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant first suffers the disability; and
 
(ii)           the deferral election of a Participant who has experienced an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency shall, to the extent provided by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(viii), be cancelled for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant first experienced the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency.
To the extent permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(viii), a Participant's deferral elections under this Plan shall also be cancelled if the Administrative Committee determines that such action is necessary for the Participant to obtain a hardship distribution from a Qualified Plan pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3).
 
4.3.         .  For each Plan Year, any elected deferral of Base Salary or Director Fees shall be withheld in equal amounts from each payment thereof which is made during the year, as adjusted from time to time for increases or decreases in Base Salary or Director Fees.  Any deferral of a Bonus shall be withheld at the time the Bonus is otherwise payable to the Participant.  These amounts shall be treated as the Participant's Annual Deferral Amount for the Plan Year and credited to the Participant's Annual Account for such Plan Year at the time such amounts would otherwise have been paid to the Participant.

The value shall also be adjusted for any (i) all Participant and Employer contribution credits made since the last Valuation Date and (ii) payments made to the Participant (or his or her beneficiary) since that date.

times remain with the Employer and Participants shall not have any property interest whatsoever in such assets.

(b)
                                
The determination of the amount to be distributed under this Section shall be based upon the value of the Participant's vested Accounts as of the last Valuation Date preceding the date of distribution, determined in accordance with Section 6.1.  If annual installments are elected pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i) above, the amount of each installment payment hereunder shall be determined by dividing the value of the Accounts as of the last Valuation Date by the number of installments if any remaining to be paid (including the current installment).
(c)

the election does not become effective until at least 12 months after the election is made;

the date on which payment is to begin is delayed for at least 5 years from the date the payment would otherwise have been made; and
 
(d)
                                
the election meets such other requirements as may be determined by the Administrative Committee to be necessary to comply with Code Section 409A.

Committee in its sole discretion, or (ii) the amount necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, plus amounts reasonably necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution.  Such payment shall be made in a lump sum no later than sixty (60) days after the Administrative Committee's decision to approve the payment.
(c)

(b)
                                
If a Participant is not married at the time of his or her death, the Participant's beneficiary shall be the individual or trust the Participant has designated in accordance with subsection (c) below prior to his or her death.

All interpretations, determinations and decisions of the Administrative Committee with respect to any claim hereunder shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be final and conclusive.
 
9.3.
                           
Liability for Benefit Payments
.  The obligation to pay a Participant's benefits under the Plan shall, at all times, be the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of the Employer that was responsible for the credits made to his or her Accounts under the Plan, but only to extent of such credits and any applicable appreciation or depreciation determined in
accordance with Section 6.1(b).  No other Employer or other person or entity shall be liable for such payments.

10.3.
                    
Participant's Rights Unsecured
.  The Plan is intended to be unfunded for purposes of both the Code and ERISA.

To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from an Employer under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any general unsecured creditor of the Employer.

Domestic Relations Orders
.  If a court determines that a Spouse or former Spouse of a Participant has an interest in the Participant's vested Accounts under a final domestic relations order, the Administrative Committee (or its delegate) may, in its sole discretion consistent with Code Section 409A, distribute the Spouse's or former Spouse's interest to that Spouse or former Spouse in accordance with such order.

10.8.
                    
Effect on Employment Rights
.

No Participant shall have the right to receive any benefit under the Plan except in accordance with the Plan's terms.
 
10.9.
                    
Severability
.  If any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or unlawful for any reason, such event shall not affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Plan.

The date of such mailing shall be deemed the date of notice, consent, election, claim or demand.
 
10.11.
             
Tax Liability

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, to the extent permitted by the Administrative Committee consistent with Code Section 409A, elect to pay any required employment taxes (and any resulting income taxes) that arise as of the date of deferral (or, if
later, vesting) hereunder either (a) by direct payment or (b) through the withholding of such amounts from other compensation due the Participant.  In the alternative, the Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, offset such taxes against the Participant's vested Accounts to the extent permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4) or other applicable regulations.
10.12.
             
No Guarantee of Benefits
.  Nothing in this Plan shall constitute a guarantee by Employer, Company, Administrative Committee or any other person or entity that the Employer's assets will be sufficient to pay any benefits hereunder.
 
10.13.
             
Incapacity of Recipient
.  If the Administrative Committee determines that any person to whom any benefits are payable hereunder is (a) unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident or (b) a minor, any payment due under the Plan may be paid to the duly appointed guardian or conservator of such person or to any third party who is eligible to receive payment from the Plan for the account of such person.  Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the Employer's liability for such payments hereunder.

Exhibit 10.2
 
These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to any Award of restricted stock units granted to an employee of the Company on or after December 17, 2012, under the AECOM Technology Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and its amendments (the "Plan"), which are evidenced by a Term Sheet or an action of the Administrator that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions.

TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
AECOM Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant named in the Term Sheet provided to said Participant herewith or otherwise provided electronically (the "Term Sheet") an award of a number of restricted stock units (the "Award") specified in the Term Sheet.  Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions, and the Plan, each as amended from time to time.  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Term Sheet, any reference to the Company shall, unless the context requires otherwise, include a reference to any Subsidiary, as such term is defined in the Plan.

VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date set forth in the Term Sheet and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet and these Standard Terms and Conditions.  After the Grant Date, subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Award shall become vested as described in the Term Sheet; provided that (except as set forth in Section 5 below) the Participant does not experience a termination of employment (as defined in the Plan).  Each date on which restricted stock units subject to the Award vest is referred to herein as a "Vesting Date."  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Term Sheet to the contrary, if a Vesting Date is not a business day, the applicable portion of the Award shall vest on the prior business day.  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Vested Units."  Restricted stock units granted under the Award that are not vested and remain subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Unvested Units."  The vesting period of the Award may be adjusted by the Administrator to reflect the decreased level of employment during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis, provided that the Administrator may take into consideration any accounting consequences to the Company in making any such adjustment.

SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
Each Vested Unit will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 12 of the Plan) to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to the Participant's estate, heir or beneficiary, promptly following the applicable Vesting Date (but in no event later than 90 days following the Vesting Date); provided that the Participant has satisfied all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below, and that the Participant has completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Company deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock.  The issuance of the shares of Common Stock hereunder may be affected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant's behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.
 
Notwithstanding the above, (i) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, (ii) the Company may issue shares of Common Stock hereunder subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Company's counsel, are necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (iii) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters (which delay shall in no event extend beyond 90 days following the Vesting Date).

RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
 
Prior to any issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of the Award, no shares of Common Stock will be reserved or earmarked for the Participant or the Participant's account nor shall the Participant have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares. The Participant will not be entitled to any privileges of ownership of the shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, any voting or dividend rights) underlying Vested Units and/or Unvested Units unless and until shares of Common Stock are actually delivered to the Participant hereunder.

The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the Vesting Period and the numerator is the number of whole months from beginning date of the Vesting Period through the date of termination. Any unearned or Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.  For purposes of the Award and these Standard Terms and Conditions, the term "Retirement" means retirement from active employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) at or after age 60 and with the approval of the Administrator or (ii) at or after age 65.  The determination of the Administrator as to an individual's Retirement shall be conclusive on all parties.

Upon termination of the Participant's employment for Cause, all Vested Units and Unvested Units shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to the Participant.
 
6.
                                     
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
 
The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of Vested Units, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (c) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (d) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (e) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.
 
At no time will the Participant have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Participant any Shares acquired by the Participant under the Award.  Any Shares acquired by such Participant under the Award may not be repurchased by the Company for a period of six (6) months following the date on which the Participant acquired such Shares pursuant to the Award.
7.
                                     
INCOME TAXES
 
The Participant will be subject to federal and state income and other tax withholding requirements on a date (generally, the Settlement Date) determined by applicable law (any such date, the "Taxable Date"), based on the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the units that are vested.  The Participant will be solely responsible for the payment of all U.S. federal income and other taxes, including any state, local or non-U.S. income or employment tax obligation that may be related to the Vested Units, including any such taxes that are required to be withheld and paid to the applicable tax authorities (the "Tax Withholding Obligation").  The Participant will be responsible for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.
 
By accepting the Award the Participant agrees that, unless and to the extent the Participant has otherwise satisfied the Tax Withholding Obligations in a manner permitted or required by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan, the Company is authorized to withhold from the shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant in respect of Vested Units the whole number of shares (rounded down) having a value (as determined by the Company consistent with any applicable tax requirements) on the Taxable Date or the first trading day before the Taxable Date sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation.  If the withheld shares are not sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares of Common Stock described above; and, if the withheld shares are more than sufficient to satisfy the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company shall make such arrangement as it determines appropriate to credit such amount for the Participant's benefit.
 
At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Settlement Date), the Participant may elect to satisfy all or any part of the Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient (in light of the uncertainty of the exact amount thereof) to so satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a personal check payable to the Company, or (iii) such other means as specified from time to time by the Administrator, in each case unless the Company has specified prior to such date that the Participant is not permitted to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company has the right to retain, without notice, from shares issuable under the Award or from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
The Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Participant in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 7 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying Vested Units. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's tax liability.
8.
                                     
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD
 
Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Participant may not assign, transfer or pledge the Award, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto or any right or interest therein to anyone other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The Company may cancel the Participant's Award if the Participant attempts to assign or transfer it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 8.
 
9.
                                     
THE PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
 
In addition to these Terms and Conditions, the Award shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference. Certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of these Standard Terms and Condition and the Plan, the Plan controls.

LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARD
 
Neither the Participant (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Term Sheet or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person in respect of Vested Units.
 
11.
                              
NOT A CONTRACT FOR EMPLOYMENT
 
Nothing in the Plan, in the Term Sheet, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Company's employ or service, nor limit in any way the Company's right to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason.

LOS ANGELES (Feb. 5, 2013)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM) reported first-quarter revenue of $2.0 billion, and revenue, net of other direct costs
1
, of $1.2 billion.  Operating income decreased 19.3%* largely driven by previously discussed actions taken to better align the cost structure of its Australia business in light of the country's slowdown in mining.  These actions are factored into the company's full-year EPS guidance.  Reported net income attributable to AECOM in the quarter was $38 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.36 for the first quarter.
 
 
*All comparisons are year over year unless noted otherwise.
 
"We drove solid net service revenue improvement in Asia, Europe, management support services and in our civil infrastructure markets," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "We booked $2.7 billion in new wins and increased our backlog by 8% to $17.1 billion.  As expected, our results were negatively impacted by actions we took in Australia to align our business against the backdrop of a country-wide slowdown in mining.  Excluding Australia, operating income margins in our professional technical services segment were up, reflecting progress against our longer-term margin target through cost-containment initiatives and improved execution.  These results demonstrate that our diversified growth model, capital allocation strategy and performance culture are delivering as we work to further improve growth, profitability and liquidity."

AECOM's revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through costs and, therefore, the company believes that revenue, net of other direct costs (net service revenue), which is a non-GAAP measure, also provides a meaningful perspective on its business results. See the accompanying reconciliation for a reconciliation of revenue, net of other direct costs, to revenue, the closest comparable GAAP measure.

Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is a non-GAAP measure. See the accompanying reconciliation for a reconciliation of free cash flow from operations, the closest comparable GAAP measure.
 
 
 
2-2-2
 
"Our intense focus on improved returns and cash conversion enabled us to generate $54 million in free cash flow for the quarter," said AECOM President Michael S. Burke.  "As a result of our liquidity and the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy, we invested $173 million during the quarter to repurchase 8 million shares.  We also completed three niche acquisitions that strengthen our technical and end market expertise while also expanding our global footprint."  Burke continued: "Confidence in our long-term outlook supports our board's decision to approve an additional $500 million for share repurchase and also to target returning at least 50% of our free cash flow over the next two years to our shareholders.  Since the inception of our repurchase program in 2011, we have invested more than $435 million to repurchase 20 million shares, reducing our share count by 17%."
 
New Wins and Backlog
During the quarter, new wins reached $2.7 billion, driven by strength in the company's facilities and transportation end markets, particularly in North America.  Book to burn
4
 was 1.3x for the quarter, while total backlog at Dec. 31, 2012, was $17.1 billion.  These metrics demonstrate the underlying strength of AECOM's business as clients increasingly turn to the company for its integrated service platform and global expertise.
 
Cash Flow
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $67 million.  Free cash flow, which includes capital expenditures of $13 million, totaled $54 million.  The net contribution to free cash flow in the quarter from the sale of receivables was $51 million.  Days sales outstanding (DSOs) improved by 1.6 days to 94 in the quarter.  The company reconfirmed that it is well positioned to meet its fiscal 2013 target of generating free cash flow equal to or in excess of its net income.
 
Balance Sheet
As of Dec. 31, 2012, AECOM had $591 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of debt and $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities with $855 million in unused capacity.
 
Business Segments
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, and program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
First-quarter revenue of $1.77 billion declined 2.0%, and revenue, net of other direct costs, declined by 0.6% to $1.09 billion as double-digit growth in Asia was offset by the challenging macroeconomic environment in Australia and the U.S.  Profitability declined by 14.7% as the business absorbed costs to right-size the Australia mining practice.  Excluding Australia, operating profit and margins improved, reflecting the benefits of operational improvement initiatives and growth.  Through the balance of the year, the company expects significant improvement in profitability in PTS as Australia completes its right-sizing actions and benefits from improved utilization.
 
Management Support Services
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
Revenue increased 10.9% to $246 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 16.4% to $151 million driven by growth in Asia and the Middle East.  Operating income declined 20.2% to $9.6 million, reflecting a lower contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures in the quarter.  The company expects full year operating income, on an adjusted basis
5
, to double versus last year, which indicates a strong profit trajectory for the remainder of the year.
 
4
Book to burn is defined as the amount of new business divided by gross revenue recognized during the period.
5
Adjusted operating income excludes the impact of the goodwill impairment charge taken in fiscal 2012.
 
 
 
3-3-3
 
Fiscal 2013 Outlook
AECOM's target EPS range for fiscal 2013 is $2.40 to $2.50, and the company now has increased confidence in the high end of the range.  The impact of a lower full-year diluted share count and effective tax rate gives the company increased confidence in the high end of the range.  EPS guidance is based on a full-year diluted share count of 103 million shares, which reflects the impact of shares repurchased through the end of the first fiscal quarter.  The company now expects its full-year effective tax rate to be 27 percent, reflecting the retroactive adoption of research and development tax credits approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2013.
 
Through the year, the company expects sequential growth in profit margins in PTS supported by improved profitability in Australia as well as an improved profit trajectory in MSS.
 
Five-Year Free Cash Flow Target
AECOM confirms its five-year free cash flow target with a range of $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion.  This target is based on a range of assumptions related to growth, profitability and working capital requirements.

This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  In particular, the company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as revenue, net of other direct costs, backlog, and free cash flow also provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business.  This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

LOS ANGELES (May 7, 2013)
 AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM) reported second-quarter revenue of $2.0 billion, and revenue, net of other direct costs
1
, of $1.3 billion.  Operating income of $80 million and reported net income
2
 of $54 million both increased 10 percent, and diluted earnings per share of $0.53 were up 23 percent.
 
 
*All comparisons are year over year unless noted otherwise.
 
"During the quarter, we executed well against our long-term objectives, including continued expansion in emerging markets and an improved mix of higher-margin technical and construction services," said John M. Dionisio, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer.  "We booked $2 billion in new wins, which contributed to our $17.1 billion in backlog.  We saw strength in emerging markets  such as civil infrastructure in Asia as well as transportation and construction services in the Middle East  and we continued to drive improvements in our Management Support Services business, which included actions to diversify that operation for sustained growth and profitability.  Given these results, we are reaffirming our full-year EPS guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50."
 
"This was our fourth consecutive quarter of free cash flow in excess of net income, as our working-capital initiatives continue to improve returns, drive long-term value and support our capital-allocation priorities," said Michael S. Burke, AECOM president.  "We invested $65 million to repurchase 2 million shares, which brings our year-to-date total to $238 million invested to repurchase 10 million shares.  We also made organic investments to advance our long-term strategy, such as the first investment by our AECOM Capital fund, which is structured to make direct investments in real estate and public-private opportunities that can benefit from our comprehensive service offerings."

New Wins and Backlog
 
New wins of $2 billion were driven by strength in the company's construction and transportation end markets, particularly in North America.  The company's book-to-burn ratio
4
 was 1.0 for the quarter, maintaining total backlog at March 31, 2013, of $17.1 billion.  These metrics demonstrate the underlying strength of AECOM's business as clients increasingly turn to the company for its integrated service platform and global expertise.
 
Tax Rate
The company's second-quarter effective tax rate of 20.6 percent, inclusive of non-controlling interest deduction, reflects the impact in the quarter of the reenactment of research and design tax credits in the U.S. The company expects its full-year effective tax rate to be 27 percent.
 
Cash Flow
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $85 million.  Free cash flow, which includes capital expenditures of $12 million, totaled $74 million.  Days sales outstanding (DSOs) improved by 7 days to 91 in the quarter.  The company reconfirmed that it is well positioned to meet its fiscal 2013 target of generating free cash flow equal to or in excess of its net income.
 
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2013, AECOM had $628 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $1.3 billion of debt and $1.05 billion in committed bank facilities with $717 million in unused capacity.
 
Business Segments
 
In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its two segments: Professional Technical Services (PTS) and Management Support Services (MSS).
 
Professional Technical Services
 
The PTS segment delivers planning, consulting, architecture and engineering design, as well as program and construction management services to institutional, commercial and public sector clients worldwide.
 
Revenue of $1.77 billion declined 2 percent, and revenue, net of other direct costs, declined 5 percent to $1.11 billion, as declines in Australia and the Americas were only partially offset by growth in Asia.  Profitability increased 6 percent aided by broad-based improvements in operating leverage and efficiencies.
 
Management Support Services
 
The MSS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government.
 
Revenue increased 7 percent to $224 million, and revenue, net of other direct costs, increased 12 percent to $142 million driven by growth in the Middle East.  Operating income increased over 450 percent to $11 million, aided by improved project performance and cost structure. The company continues to expect full-year operating income, on an adjusted basis
5
, to double versus last year.
 
 
 
3-3-3
 
Fiscal 2013 Outlook
AECOM's target EPS range for fiscal 2013 is $2.40 to $2.50.  EPS guidance is based on a full-year diluted share count of 103 million shares which reflects the impact of shares repurchased through the end of the second fiscal quarter.  The company expects its full-year effective tax rate to be 27 percent.
 
Five-Year Free Cash Flow Target
AECOM reaffirms its five-year free cash flow target of $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion.  This target is based on a range of assumptions related to growth, profitability and working capital requirements.

Term Credit Agreement
 
On June 7, 2013, AECOM Technology Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Term Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Term Lenders").  Pursuant to the Term Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $750 million in term loans on the closing date and may borrow up to an additional $100 million in term loans upon request by the Company subject to certain conditions, including Company and lender approval. The Company used approximately $675 million of the proceeds of the loans to repay indebtedness under its prior term loan facility, approximately $72 million of the proceeds to pay down indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and other short term indebtedness and a portion of the proceeds to pay fees and expenses related to the Term Credit Agreement.
 
The loans under the Term Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.25% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.25%, both based on the debt-to-earnings leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter. The initial interest rate of the loans borrowed on June 7 is the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.50%, or a total of 1.73%.
 
Payments of the initial principal amount outstanding under the Term Credit Agreement are required on an annual basis beginning on June 30, 2014. Any remaining principal of the loans under the Term Credit Agreement is due no later than June 7, 2018. Accrued interest is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis for Base Rate loans, and at the end of the applicable interest period (but at least every three months) for Eurodollar Rate loans. The Company may optionally prepay the loans at any time, without penalty.
 
The Term Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that have the effect of limiting under certain circumstances the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge with other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a change in control, create new liens, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business, enter into transactions with affiliates, or substantially change the general nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Term Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios.
 
The Company's obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries pursuant to a subsidiary guaranty. The loans under the Term Credit Agreement are unsecured.
 
Events of default under the Term Credit Agreement are customary and include, but are not limited to, (i) non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts due under the Term Credit Agreement, (ii) the violation of terms, covenants, representations or warranties in the Term Credit Agreement or related loan documents, (iii) certain events of default under agreements governing certain indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, (iv) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation involving the Company or certain subsidiaries, (v) final judgments in excess of 3.0% of the Company's net worth and (vi) the occurrence of an ERISA Event (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) in certain circumstances.
 
Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement
 
In connection with the consummation of the Term Credit Agreement, on June 7, 2013 the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 20, 2011 (as so amended, the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Revolving Lenders").  The Fourth Amendment, among other things, conforms certain provisions in the Revolving Credit Agreement to the applicable provisions in the Term Credit Agreement, including with respect to (i) certain definitions, (ii) certain tax provisions and (iii) the inclusion of Material Minority Investments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) as a trigger for the leverage ratio step up provision contained in Section 7.11 of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
 
The descriptions set forth above are qualified in their entirety by the Term Credit Agreement and the Fourth Amendment, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this report and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
The Company and its affiliates maintain various commercial and service relationships with certain of the Term Lenders and Revolving Lenders and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business and certain of the Term Lenders and Revolving Lenders and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking, financial advisory or other services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have in the past and/or may in the future receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.

thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
